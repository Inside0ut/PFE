This repository contain data sources and code files for our final year project titled "Measuring Risks with AI-based Targted Advertising"

## The project is devised into two main tasks : 
#### - **Task 1** : Where we conduct a set of experiments to identify the best machine learning model to classify an advertisement as *commercial* or *informational*
#### - **Task 2** : Where we conduct a set of experiments to identify the best machine learning model to classify the persuasion strategy being used by an informational ad
