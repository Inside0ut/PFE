This repository contain data sources and code files for our final year project titled "Measuring Risks with AI-based Targted Advertising"

## This project is devised into two main tasks : 

### **Task 1**  (classifier-1)
We conduct a set of experiments with different classification models and identify the best model for classifying an advertisement as *commercial* or *informational*. 


### **Task 2**  (classifier-2)
We conduct a set of experiments with different classification models to identify the best model for classifying an advertisement according to 5 persuasion strategies : Authority bias, Scracity bias, Consensus, Moral Appeal, Positive Emotions and Negative Emotions.

**All the data that was used for training and validation of the classifiers is available in this repository. Data used for classifier-1 is hand-annotated, while training data for classifier-2 is annotated by word filters. However, samples used for validation for classifier-2 are hand-annotated**
