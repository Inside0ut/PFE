# Persuasion Detection in Informational ads on Facebook 

This repository contains data sources and code files for detecting persuasion in informational ads. 

## Classifiers : 

### **Task 1**  (classifier-1)
We conduct a set of experiments with different text classification models and identify the best one for classifying an advertisement as *commercial* or *informational*.


### **Task 2**  (classifier-2)
We conduct a set of experiments with different classification models to identify the best one for classifying an advertisement according to 5 persuasion strategies : Authority bias, Scracity bias, Consensus, Moral Appeal, Positive Emotions and Negative Emotions.

## Datasets : 
All the data that was used for training and validation is available in this repository on CSV files. Data used for classifier-1 is hand-labeled, while training data for classifier-2 is auto-labeled. However, for the second classifier, we add some samples for validation that could be used to verify how classifiers perfom on manually classified persuasion (not based on vocabulary necessarily).
