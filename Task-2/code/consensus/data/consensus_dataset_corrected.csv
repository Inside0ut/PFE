"radical animal extremist group files petitions with the us surgeon general and president trump to close livestock markets
the covid pandemic has brought worldwide turmoil and a broad spectrum of problems from the physical effects the virus itself can have to the financial struggles of millions unemployed by widespread shutdowns add to this the unscrupulous animal extremist groups that are attempting to further their agenda in the wake of this pandemic many american families struggle to keep food on their tables as they face unemployment and the reality of a greatly disrupted national food supply chain one particular group the physicians committee for responsible medicine pcrm is actively seeking to exacerbate food insecurity in the united states by petitioning lawmakers to close live animal markets as well as meat processing plants
false claims and more petitions
on april   the group filed a legal petition for rulemaking with the us surgeon general to demand that all live animal markets in the united states be shut down immediately due to the role played by the wuhan china huanan seafood wholesale market in spreading the virus pcrm makes the false claim that any type of animal market has the potential to spread covid from animals to humans
in addition the group is petitioning president trump to rescind his order for united states meat processing plants to remain open pcrm is shameless maneuvering during a time when americans are already suffering from loss of income and shortages of essential goods demonstrates the group is incredible disconnect from reality disregard for the true wellbeing of the population and degree of extremist zealotry
with numerous meat packing plants closed or greatly limited due to a shortage of workers caused by covid america is getting a painful glimpse of what even a partial shutdown of the meat industry means for the publicsparsely stocked meat cases at the grocery store
meanwhile for some sectors of the animal agriculture industry even a limited number of closed plants have forced the euphemistically phrased depopulation of surplus animalsthousands of healthy finished meat animals wastefully destroyed for lack of somewhere to send them to be processed into meat and byproducts and no other options to house them
if pcrm had its way this situation would overtake all of animal agriculture in the name of covid and result in the entirely wasteful deaths of literally millions of animals that would otherwise become part of the nation is food and product supply chain the effects of such a grim and needless scenario would spread far beyond the direct ruin of producers the food industry would be far from the only one affected since byproducts of meat production are essential components in countless everyday items used by virtually every person in the united states
livestock is vital role in the overall food cycle
pcrm willfully turns a blind eye to the vital role that livestock production plays in the overall food cycle for example livestock can graze and thrive in areas that cannot be used to grow crops livestock can also utilize byproducts of crop production and other food waste that are unconsumable for humans in addition manure from cattle feedlots is used to fertilize crop fields that grow grains and vegetables
platform of fallacies
even in normal times and in the extremely unlikely scenario that the entire general populace would convert to veganism it would be impossible to sustainably and efficiently produce the sheer amount of plant products to feed and adequately nourish one nation much less the world
it is easy to see how pcrm is entire platform is based upon fallacies fallacies that are necessary for them to dupe people into supporting their agenda
given the group is long history of illveiled deceptions though it is really no surprise
prcmwho they really are
physicians committee for responsible medicine was founded in  by neal barnard barnard wrote  books between  and  and in  founded the barnard medical center as part of pcrm he was nominated for induction into the animal rights hall of fame in  barnard is training was in psychiatry but he has spent the majority of his career masquerading as an expert in nutrition promoting strict veganism and denigrating the use of animal products and animals in medicine and research this has all been under the guise of advocating for human health his namesake clinic adheres to the animal extremist ideology irresponsibly treating patients with veganism as blanket cure for all manner of diseases and conditions
less than  of prcm members are actual physicians
pcrm is name itself the physicians committee for responsible medicine is very blatantly and intentionally misleading currently less than  of reported members are actual physicians the true number of pcrm members that are genuine medical professionals is also highly questionable since anyone with or without credentials can join the watchdog group activist facts website states pcrm has successfully duped the media and much of the general public into believing that its pronouncements about the superiority of vegetarianonly diets represent the opinion of the medical community
prcm opposes lifesaving use of animals and campaigns against respected health charities
in addition to promoting veganism pcrm fanatically opposes the lifesaving use of animals in the medical field from research to the animalderived products essential for numerous medical materials and medicines the group has actively and aggressively campaigned against numerous widely respected health charities that support and utilize animal research to help cure human diseasesgroups such as the american heart association the american cancer society st jude children is research hospital the american foundation for aids research the christopher reeve paralysis foundation the american red cross and the march of dimes
prcm is harshly criticized by physicians and the american medical association
pcrm has been harshly criticized by a number of doctors and medical groups the american medical association ama once referred to pcrm as a fringe organization that employs unethical tactics and is interested in perverting medical science montreal quebec is mcgill university chemist dr joe schwarcz called pcrm a fanatical animal rights group with a clearcut agenda of promoting a vegan lifestyle that masquerades as a just scientific body
one former director of research for the center for consumer freedom stated neal barnard is using his latest book to disguise animal rights propaganda as medical advicemost americans are too smart to take dietary advice from peta but that is exactly what you get with barnard is antimeat recommendations
prcm has connections to radical animal extremist groups
it stands to reason that barnard and pcrm have had long and welldocumented interconnectedness with groups like the people for the ethical treatment of animals peta and other animal extremist groups including two that were considered to be domestic terrorist threats by the department of justice animal liberation front alf and shac stop huntingdon animal cruelty
former pcrm spokesperson dr jerry vlasak was quoted as saying i think there is a use for violence in our movement and i think it can be an effective strategy not only is it morally acceptable i think that there are places where it could be used quite effectively from a pragmatic standpoint and i dont think youd have to kill assassinate too many vivisectors before you would see a marked decrease in the amount of vivisection going on and i think for  lives  lives  human lives we could save a million  million  million nonhuman animals people get all excited about oh what is going to happen when the alf accidentally kills somebody in an arson well you know i mean i think we need to get used to this idea it is going to happen okay it is going to happen
pcrm does not openly advocate violence and thus distanced itself from vlasak but actively works to hide its ties to peta and other blatant animal extremist groups to help maintain the charade of being simply doctors advocating for human health
prcm founder has served as peta is medical advisor
the deep ties between pcrm and peta are not only ideological but have been financial and operational as well over the years barnard has shared professional and allegedly even personal relationships with peta is leader ingrid newkirk barnard has served as peta is medical advisor and has penned numerous articles as such he also served on the board of the peta foundation now known as the foundation to support animal protection
smoke mirrors and money
hundreds of thousands of dollars have been funneled to pcrm from peta via the foundation it is a common tactic among animal extremist groups to branch out and share members and leadership it serves as smoke and mirrors when resources are diverted or pooled among such groups as well as to present a facade of credibility to the public when such groups quote one another
it is easy to see why pcrm has been referred to as peta is labcoated sibling in ad campaigns similar to those of peta pcrm has claimed that animal products are equivalent to drugs and that feeding children animal products is the same as child abuse relying on shock value to catch attention and earn support from the uninformed examples of pcrm ads are an image of a corpse on a gurney holding a hamburger and of the wisconsin cheesehead on a grim reaper figure
in a time when concerns about public health are at the forefront it is reprehensible that pcrm is preying on society is fears to further their barelycloaked extremist agenda further to vie for the complete and total disruption of an already struggling food supply system and the unavoidable suffering that would follow is nothing short of sadism",1

the total and complete heartbreak of not being able to save them all    on friday sept st at am animal control employees arrived to work at the carsonlos angeles county animal shelter they found two cocker spaniels that had been tied up to the gate of the shelter parking lot both dogs clearly had been outdoor dogs matted dirty  but one dog was emaciated and very weak the municipal animal shelters are not set up to operate as animal hospitals the shelter sent the sickly dog to an outside vet to get a more thorough exam camp cocker rescue had driven more than two hours one way to the carson shelter that same day to meet both dogs and get our name on them so that we could have first chance to get them once their stray hold was up we did not get to meet the sickly cocker because he was already sent out to a private vet later on that day the shelter phoned us to say that the sickly dog had to be euthanized because he was suffering and was in a state of crisis we learned after he had been euthanized that the private vet had said he was flea infested and severely anemic and the only way to save his life would have been a blood transfusion this was crushing news to us because we would have taken him to a specialty hospital to get a blood transfusion and attempted to save his life he was on a stray hold though and legally the shelter was in a grey area if they had released the dog to us that was still on stray hold and we had done major medical treatments on him to save his life the owners could have come forward to claim the dog and we would have been forced to return him that is always a gamble in these situations but we wish that the shelter had thought to call us and give us that option we spoke to one of the supervisors there and asked them to please let all of the staff know that in the future if there is ever a cocker spaniel that they are considering euthanizing due to major medical to please call us asap because we want to have the chance to step in in the shelter is defense they are dealing with situations like this all of the time they are not set up to triage animals like an emergency animal hospital and this shelter is in a more low income area so it is common to see animals turn up at the shelter that are in dire need of medical care the whole thing was heartbreaking absolutely heartbreaking we were able to rescue the other dog and his new name is now pumpkin pumpkin is the dog on the left his friend is the emaciated dog on the right pumpkin is a skittish shy dog and this confirms our hunch that these were someone is backyard dogs that were never socialized or vetted or cared for in any way in honor of pumpkin is friend whom we never met we would like to posthumously honor him by giving him a nice name and including his picture on our calendar for next year we have a rainbow bridge section where he will be featured would you like to make a small donation today in honor of pumpkin is friend and also contribute some name suggestions we will be putting them all in a jar and pulling a name out so he can have the dignity of a name and a place in our calendar to remember him by donations can be made directly here on this special donate link there is a place to enter your name suggestions on that link,1

speaking truth to power about climate change the role of archetypal energies dr carroy cuf ferguson phd one of the archetypal energies that i discuss in my awardwinning book evolving the human race game a spiritual and soullinked perspective  is the archetypal energy truth speaking truth to power requires understanding what is so and to authentically face and examine what is so with courage in order to constructively act harmoniously to bring abou  t change and transformation the phenomenon of climate change requires such an approach archetypal energies are higher vibrational energies operating deep within our psyches individually and collectively that lead us when accessed toward our optimal selves and optimal realities we tend to experience them as creative urges overall i have identified twentyfive archetypal energies that can be helpful at individual and collective levels for all aspects of our lives including the phenomenon of climate change i will have more to say about them in relation to climate change and other matters in subsequent articles here i want to briefly reference just a few of them as they relate to climate changeprimarily truth with the supporting archetypal energies understanding courage and harmony note i use familiar terms to evoke a common sense of these higher energiestruth is one of what i call spiritually integrative archetypal energies as is understanding courage is one of what i call foundational archetypal energies while harmony is one of what i call transformational archetypal energies in speaking truth to power on september   a global climate strike was scheduled starting with the global youth climate strike on september   followed by a gathering at the united nations on september st and then on september   greta thunberg did an outstanding job of speaking truth to power at the united nation climate action summit in this context the supporting archetypal energy courage was demonstrated with passion courage is and will continue to be needed and at play as the climate change drama continues to unfold that is we must all find and access the archetypal energy courage within to speak truth to power about this global planetary phenomenon it is noteworthy at this point simply to point out that over the years we the association and i have not been on the sidelines in regard to the global planetary phenomenon of climate change and the critical role that archetypal energies can play for example in june  i wrote an article for ahp perspective titled mother earth speaks change yourself change the world use the archetypal energy harmony as a guide in that article i stated the following in relation to the cosmos we all as human beings live on this tiny planet we call earth a planet that supports and sustains life as we know it there are many different kinds of people plants and animals functioning in harmony with soil air and waterall linked to one another in a complex web of life to form one earth community unfortunately we often take this miracle and ecosystem of life for granted when however we take the ecosystem of life too much for granted mother earth speaks reflecting imbalances and disharmonies when mother earth speaks her message is a simple one it is time for corrective action to make a changechange yourself change the world that truth holds just as much power today in  and beyond as it did then in  it is and can be used as a baseline framework for understanding the phenomenon of climate change and successfully addressing the imbalances and disharmonies we change ourselves by changing how we think about ourselves and in turn we change the world that is if we see ourselves as separate and independent from each other and the planet as a whole we construct that kind of reality at individual and collective levels and if we see ourselves as connected and interdependent beings inhabiting one planet we construct an entirely different kind of reality in essence then when we change how we think about ourselves we also change how we think about and deal with the world we inhabit when the latter form of interdependent thinking is fully embodied as ones truth individually and collectively we know at a core level that in taking care of the planet our climate we are also taking care of ourselves we can thus speak our truth to power about climate change with a sense of inner integrity and knowingness ahp therefore fully supports all efforts to address and rectify the imbalances and disharmonies flowing from climate change in that regard some years ago we the association and i received an invitation for ahp to become an affiliate member of the medical society consortium on climate change and health  it was a nobrainer as we all were instantaneously aware of the interdependent nature of our individual and collective well being and how that interdependence connects us all to the well being of the planet and the future of humanity representing ahp as an affiliate of the consortium i also had the privilege of helping to plan and to attend the most recent consortium annual conference and congressional visits that took place april   in arlington virginia and washington dc it is important to note here that the consortium and its affiliates endorse the global call to action on climate and health and the domestic policy agenda called the u s call to action on climate health and equity a policy action agenda this domestic policy agenda is part of an overall effort to speak truth to power about climate change by many likeminded and awake people and organizations while i reference larger scale efforts above it is important to recognize that in regard to speaking truth to power all efforts regardless of how small or grand matter in the short and long term for sustaining the planet and life as we know it we must all find the courage to speak truth to power until there is global recognition and understanding about the effects of climate change at individual and collective levels with urgent and effective action now balance and harmony may and can become a natural way of being on planet earth see ahpweborg for this blog

"south carolina is  pension plans were a combined  billion underfunded before covid hurt the stock market that is more than  for every man woman and child in this state with  baby boomers turning  every day in the us our state and many others is moving closer every day to a pension crisis the next recession or depression could create major havoc while our roads are crumbling and our pension funds ranks as the th most underfunded state pension fund system in the country and nd worst performing what does our legislature do unfortunately spend more time working on shameful earmarks for things like senator jackson is church and affiliates  million over the last decade m for the greenville convention m vista greenway in columbia  million to expand a nursing program in beaufort county  million for downtown seneca  million for film project incentives  million for the sumter opera house
 in  south carolinians rely on the pension system retired teachers firefighters law enforcement and others state and local government workers depend upon the state pension funds current state and local government workers are depending upon it providing the benefits promised when they retire retirees should not be forced to one day to take massive cuts to their pensions nor should taxpayers one day be forced to pay massive taxes to bail out incompetent decisions by the legislature both of these things happened when detroit went through bankruptcy
we are heading down the same road it might not happen in the next few years but the state is current plan is not sustainable not all of the legislators are supporting the selfish decisions of the state legislature but the vast majority do legislators supporting these earmarks while standing by as the roads crumble and the pension system slips further behind should be ashamed of themselves and voted out
as your representative i will be exposing earmarks and will work hard for roads and to protect the pension system

happy sunday ive been doing a lot of thinking this week what do i want to do differently this year that i didnt do last year i tried to quit running my businesses last year enjoying time without counting it and focusing on me i have rarely ever done this in my  years around the sun as it turns out i learned a lot of valuable lessons i also decided if i was ever going to try this political thing i better get back in shape cause thinking about traveling our stat  e shaking hands and figuring out if tennesseans see what i see on the circuit of politics and the need for a new narrative will not be something i can convey if im out of shape heres what i know i cant do this without building a team i cant do this without my partner being on board i cant do this without understanding how running a campaign works i cant do this without working on me so i decided to do this one first my kids my mom and almost everyone else in my life do not understand why i might want to run for a senate seat i try to explain to everyone its just something i think i can be good at and bring a different perspective to people i like to problem solve and build things while working with people in a genuine way i feel our country is at a crossroads and financial product sellers and buyers are out of touch with average working people one generation of business men full of fear and another generation of men wondering where they fit in and women in between who do we want to be when we no longer look like we know each other anymore corporate cults are running endlessly through our financial good will and nothing i mean nothing should ever be for free its like i told several institutions in our city the moment the chattanoogan became free was the moment institutions in our town stopped caring for people and started subsidizing hate and fear not opportunity and engagement in our town sponsoring free speech is worse than paying poor people to commit terrorism because largely people dont ask who is paying for this opinionnews when they read something for free and why is their brand name not on other opinion news outlets i believe facebook should be required to charge something over nothing for us to be on here even if its a  and a federal regulatory charge this way we all have skin in the game as far as i can tell facebook has now been elected as the regulator of free speech for businesses in our country yet no tennessean sits on their board of directors this is important when discussing anticompetitive business issues citizens united will need to be readdressed in congress not in the courts because the lack of court expansion in this country has clogged our federal pipes it will take decades for court cases to make their way through this process now dont even get me started on state courts until we the people realize why all of this is important to our liberty especially our economic liberty nothing will change those who are poor now will remain poor forever theyll just have to travel further for work and rec center kids like me will be a dying breed its just this simple god help the middle classes i think steve schmidt put it best how did donald trump get elected president for me is pretty easy  percent of americans do not have  of available cash there are more payday lenders than there are starbucks and there are almost more payday lenders than mcdonalds and starbucks combined there hasnt been a real wage increase in this country for working people for many years the defining fact for this generation was the economic collapse of  what should people think when the bankers get a trilliondollar bailout and no one goes to jail thirteen million american families are foreclosed on  no small number of them being told by a deputy sheriff to get all their belongings out of the house in  minutes  million americans lose their jobs one set of rules for everybody up here meaning the top of the socioeconomic ladder another set for everybody down here so how is it that a bernie sanders voter in the primary votes for donald trump in the fall  all the elites are scratching their heads and saying theyre voting for crazy no the elites are out of touch  people in the middle third of the us population know three things that they are one missed paycheck away from disaster that their kids will be worse off than they are and three that theres a much better chance of them falling into the bottom third than that theyll climb up into the top third people in the bottom third see an opioid epidemic they see declining life expectancies they see rising maternal death rates they see no positive indicators anywhere so yes when a demagogue comes along and says make american great again it means three things we were a great country were not anymore put me in power and well be one again this is a picture of my grandfather cecil kinkead an erwin tn printer by trade who i got my body type from this is a picture of my grandmother betty kinkead who taught me the power of critical thinking alongside the thought that most human beings dont care about anyone but themselves i miss my grandparents everyday michele

fellow citizens for those who might have forgotten this is what leadership looks like                  nearly  years ago i led  people to safety as the captain of us airways flight  which suffered bird strikes lost thrust in the engines and was forced to make an emergency landing on the hudson river some called it the miracle on the hudson but it was not a miracle it was in microcosm an example of what is needed in emergencies  includin  g the current national crisis  and what is possible when we serve a cause greater than ourselves on our famous flight i witnessed the best in people who rose to the occasion passengers and crew worked together to help evacuate an elderly passenger and a mother with a monthold child new york waterway took the initiative to radio their vessels to head toward us when they saw us approaching this successful landing in short was the result of good judgment experience skill  and the efforts of many but as captain i ultimately was responsible for everything that happened had even one person not survived i would have considered it a tragic failure that i would have felt deeply for the rest of my life to navigate complex challenges all leaders must take responsibility and have a moral compass grounded in competence integrity and concern for the greater good i am often told how calm i sounded speaking to passengers crew and air traffic control during the emergency in every situation but especially challenging ones a leader sets the tone and must create an environment in which all can do their best you get what you project whether it is calm and confidence  or fear anger and hatred  people will respond in kind courage can be contagious today tragically too many people in power are projecting the worst many are cowardly complicit enablers acting against the interests of the united states our allies and democracy encouraging extremists at home and emboldening our adversaries abroad and threatening the livability of our planet many do not respect the offices they hold they lack  or disregard  a basic knowledge of history science and leadership and they act impulsively worsening a toxic political environment as a result we are in a struggle for who and what we are as a people we have lost what in the military we call unit cohesion the fabric of our nation is under attack while shame  a timeless beacon of right and wrong  seems dead this is not the america i know and love were better than this our ideals shared facts and common humanity are what bind us together as a nation and a people not one of these values is a political issue but the lack of them is this current absence of civic virtues is not normal and we must not allow it to become normal we must rededicate ourselves to the ideals values and norms that unite us and upon which our democracy depends we must be engaged and informed voters and we must get our information from credible reputable sources for the first  percent of my adult life i was a registered republican but i have always voted as an american and this critical election day i will do so by voting for leaders committed to rebuilding our common values and not pandering to our basest impulses when i volunteered for military service during wartime i took an oath that is similar to the one our elected officials take i do solemnly swear that i will support and defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies foreign and domestic i vowed to uphold this oath at the cost of my life if necessary we must expect no less from our elected officials and we must hold accountable those who fail to defend our nation and all our people after flight  i realized that because of the sudden worldwide fame i had been given a greater voice i knew i could not walk away but had an obligation to use this bully pulpit for good and as an advocate for the safety of the traveling public i feel that i now have yet another mission as a defender of our democracy we cannot wait for someone to save us we must do it ourselves this election day is a crucial opportunity to again demonstrate the best in each of us by doing our duty and voting for leaders who are committed to the values that will unite and protect us years from now when our grandchildren learn about this critical time in our nations history they may ask if we got involved if we made our voices heard i know what my answer will be i hope yours will be yes captain chesley b sully sullenberger,1

growing up in a small town in louisiana i have had a desire to live in a major city since i was a child something about big cities always held an allure for me i didnt know then that id one day fulfill that desire by moving  miles north along the mighty mississippi to a state that was part of the louisiana purchase  minneapolis mn  the home of nativ hq unless youve been camping in the wilderness or hiding under a rock youve no doubt heard about the extraor  dinary amount of unrest that began here a week ago on may  on that fateful day a white minneapolis police officer responding to a call kneeled on the neck of an unarmed black man for a full  agonizing minutes while being recorded by observers who also pleaded with him to get off of mr floyds neck i hate what happened to him that his life was snatched from him so senselessly that his killer stared ahead blankly as  yearold george floyd cried out for his mother and for breath mr floyds killing was inexcusable and was the catalyst of what has now become nationwide protests and riots for four nights following my floyds death minneapolis was under siege by rioters and looters who ultimately destroyed over  businesses some were large corporate business locations like autozone target and wendys the vast majority of these businesses were businesses like mine they were businesses that were the culmination of a lifetime of savings and hope and hard work they were businesses that had been built on the backs of proprietors who worked countless hours to establish them grow them and serve their customers and their communities they were mom and pop retail shops and restaurants they were barbershops that stood as pillars in the community they were immigrant and minorityowned businesses woman and veteranowned businesses they were businesses that served a diverse and mostly working class neighborhood of this beautiful city they were looted and burned without discrimination ive been in this city for  years and its become a home to me some of my kids call themselves minnesotans and vikings fans ive failed as a parent  who dat two were born in neighborhoods where the ashes of burning buildings still smolder my kids go to school in the same area i know the exact corner where george floyd was killed because ive passed it a thousand times on my way to church or music lessons or a lake to go fishing ive been to the speedway around the corner i have deep roots in louisiana and wholehearted pride in my bayou upbringing but minneapolis is where i live and work and raise my family this city is my home i love this city i live in north minneapolis an area that knows its own unrest during my time here on the northside ive coached football and baseball in the local parks and i have met some wonderful young people as a coach you quickly realize that you become more than a coach to some kids and families you become a driver and conversation partner you become a mentor and confidant in the course of building relationships you hear stories in the stories ive heard from some kids ive heard my story i see the younger angrier version of myself that i once was in these kids one of the pivotal moments of my life occurred as i entered the th grade i had been a somewhat troubled young person and found trouble for myself in high school when i tried to sign up for a program called deca my guidance counselor assured me that there was no chance for me to be accepted due to my history i went to the teacher myself and asked to join the program i was accepted deca is a program that prepares emerging leaders and entrepreneurs in marketing finance hospitality and management in high schools and colleges around the globe in deca i travelled to new york city germany and orlando to attend training student exchange programs and conferences i became an executive officer for my state chapter my membership in deca gave me more than entrepreneurial and leadership training it gave me a sense of purpose and hope this past week has been tense and difficult there has been a heartwrenching cry for justice that has filled our city streets and highways the young people of this city have witnessed a warlike situation that they will never forget and this coming in the midst of a global pandemic that had already changed nearly every aspect of daily life despite the overwhelming sense of desperation that is palpable in minneapolis each day the people of this city get up and go clean up the mess showing that there is hope the opportunities that i received in deca helped shape my future as a young adult they gave me hope i am committed to providing those same opportunities and hope to the youth of my community through nativ nativ is moving closer to the northside and we want to be a company that is a pillar in its community that is why we are creating the nativ young leaders internship our internship is specifically focused on providing opportunities to highschool students who live in north minneapolis to come for  weeks and take a peek into the inner workings of nativ it will be a paid internship and will provide interns an opportunity to learn about entrepreneurship marketing coding project management leadership and all of the other things it takes to run a business they will spend dedicated time with each team member in nativ learning the roles and how they work together they will participate on real client projects and attend client meetings most of all they will be invested in by every person on this team we are committed to making an investment into the youth of this city along with so many other wonderful organizations so that they can be the next generation of entrepreneurs and leaders this has been a desire of mine since i started nativ and after  years in business we have developed the resources to build this internship we dont have the details worked out yet but we are working hard on them and will release more details in the coming weeks if youve read this far thank you pray for our city  jon ceo,1
please read the extremely important information about covid forwarded to me by a patient very good and reliable information subject fw deep insight on covid from ucsf is top infectious disease researchers this is worth readingsent by a colleague at um subject deep insight on covid from ucsf is top infectious disease researchers with brooks help i was able to arrange a discussion yesterday with uscfs top researchers in infectious disease here are the notes i bolded some of the more notable comments from the researchers uc san francisco is either the  or  hospital in california depending on which survey you read it is the th largest medical research center in the us based on research grants university of california san francisco biohub panel on covid march    panelists o joe derisi ucsfs top infectious disease researcher copresident of chanzuckerberg biohub a jv involving ucsf  berkeley  stanford coinventor of the chip used in sars epidemic o emily crawford covid task force director focused on diagnostics o cristina tato rapid response director immunologist o patrick ayescue leading outbreak response and surveillance epidemiologist o chaz langelier ucsf infectious disease doc whats below are essentially direct quotes from the panelists i bracketed the few things that are not quotes  top takeaways o at this point we are past containment containment is basically futile our containment efforts wont reduce the number who get infected in the us o now were just trying to slow the spread to help healthcare providers deal with the demand peak in other words the goal of containment is to flatten the curve to lower the peak of the surge of demand that will hit healthcare providers and to buy time in hopes a drug can be developed o how many in the community already have the virus no one knows o we are moving from containment to care o we in the us are currently where at where italy was a week ago we see nothing to say we will be substantially different o  of the us population will be infected over the next  months after that level you can start to get herd immunity unlike flu this is entirely novel to humans so there is no latent immunity in the global population o we used their numbers to work out a guesstimate of deaths indicating about  million americans may die the panelists did not disagree with our estimate this compares to seasonal flus average of k americans per year assume  of us population thats m people infected with  mortality rate that is m americans die over the next  months the fatality rate is in the range of x flu this assumes no drug is found effective and made available o the death rate varies hugely by age over age  the mortality rate could be  see chart by age signe found online attached at bottom o dont know whether covid is seasonal but if is and subsides over the summer it is likely to roar back in fall as the  flu did o i can only tell you two things definitively definitively its going to get worse before it gets better and we will be dealing with this for the next year at least our lives are going to look different for the next year  what should we do now what are you doing for your family o appears one can be infectious before being symptomatic we dont know how infectious before symptomatic but know that highest level of virus prevalence coincides with symptoms we currently think folks are infectious  days before through  days after onset of symptoms t to t onset o how long does the virus last on surfaces best guess is  hours depending on surface type maybe a few days but still no consensus on this the virus is very susceptible to common antibacterial cleaning agents bleach hydrogen peroxide alcoholbased o avoid concerts movies crowded places o we have cancelled business travel o do the basic hygiene eg hand washing and avoiding touching face o stockpile your critical prescription medications many pharma supply chains run through china pharma companies usually hold  months of raw materials so may run out given the disruption in chinas manufacturing o pneumonia shot might be helpful not preventative of covid but reduces your chance of being weakened which makes covid more dangerous o get a flu shot next fall not preventative of covid but reduces your chance of being weakened which makes covid more dangerous o we would say anyone over  stay at home unless its critical cdc toyed with idea of saying anyone over  not travel on commercial airlines o we at ucsf are moving our atrisk parents back from nursing homes etc to their own homes then are not letting them out of the house the other members of the family are washing hands the moment they come in o three routes of infection hand to mouth  face aerosol transmission fecal oral route  what if someone is sick o if someone gets sick have them stay home and socially isolate there is very little you can do at a hospital that you couldnt do at home most cases are mild but if they are old or have lung or cardiovascular problems read on o if someone gets quite sick who is old  or with lung or cardiovascular problems take them to the er o there is no accepted treatment for covid the hospital will give supportive care eg iv fluids oxygen to help you stay alive while your body fights the disease ie to prevent sepsis o if someone gets sick who is high risk eg is both old and has lungcardiovascular problems you can try to get them enrolled for compassionate use of remdesivir a drug that is in clinical trial at san francisco general and ucsf and in china need to find a doc there in order to ask to enroll remdesivir is an antiviral from gilead that showed effectiveness against mers in primates and is being tried against covid if the trials succeed it might be available for next winter as production scales up far faster for drugs than for vaccines more i found online o why is the fatality rate much higher for older adults your immune system declines past age  fatality rate tracks closely with comorbidity ie the presence of other conditions that compromise the patients hearth especially respiratory or cardiovascular illness these conditions are higher in older adults risk of pneumonia is higher in older adults  what about testing to know if someone has covid o bottom line there is not enough testing capacity to be broadly useful heres why o currently there is no way to determine what a person has other than a pcr test no other test can yet distinguish covid from flu or from the other dozen respiratory bugs that are circulating o a polymerase chain reaction pcr test can detect covids rna however they still dont have confidence in the tests specificity ie they dont know the rate of false negatives o the pcr test requires kits with reagents and requires clinical labs to process the kits o while the kits are becoming available the lab capacity is not growing o the leading clinical lab firms quest and labcore have capacity to process  kits per day for the nation o expanding processing capacity takes time space and equipment and certification ie it wont happen soon o ucsf and ucberkeley have donated their research labs to process kits but each has capacity to process only  kits per day and are not clinically certified o novel test methods are on the horizon but not here now and wont be at any scale to be useful for the present danger  how well is society preparing for the impact o local hospitals are adding capacity as we speak ucsfs parnassus campus has erected triage tents in a parking lot they have converted a ward to negative pressure which is needed to contain the virus they are considering reopening the shuttered mt zion facility o if covid affected children then we would be seeing mass departures of families from cities but thankfully now we know that kids are not affected o school closures are one the biggest societal impacts we need to be thoughtful before we close schools especially elementary schools because of the knockon effects if elementary kids are not in school then some hospital staff cant come to work which decreases hospital capacity at a time of surging demand for hospital services o public health systems are prepared to deal with shortterm outbreaks that last for weeks like an outbreak of meningitis they do not have the capacity to sustain for outbreaks that last for months other solutions will have to be found o what will we do to handle behavior changes that can last for months many employees will need to make accommodations for elderly parents and those with underlying conditions and immunesuppressed kids home due to school closures o dr derisi had to leave the meeting for a call with the governors office when he returned we asked what the call covered the epidemiological models the state is using to track and trigger action the state is planning at what point they will take certain actions ie what will trigger an order to cease any gatherings of over  people  where do you find reliable news o the john hopkins center for health security site which posts daily updates the site says you can sign up to receive a daily newsletter on covid by email i tried and the page times out due to high demand after three more tries i was successful in registering for the newsletter o the new york times is good on scientific accuracy  observations on china o unlike during sars chinas scientists are publishing openly and accurately on covid o while chinas early reports on incidence were clearly low that seems to trace to their data management systems being overwhelmed not to any bad intent o wuhan has  beds per thousand while us has  beds per thousand wuhan built  additional hospitals in  weeks even so most patients were sent to gymnasiums to sleep on cots o early on no one had info on covid so china reacted in a way unique modern history except in wartime  every few years there seems another sars ebola mers hn covid growing strains of antibiotic resistant bacteria are we in the twilight of a century of medicines great triumph over infectious disease o weve been in a back and forth battle against viruses for a million years o but it would sure help if every country would shut down their wet markets o as with many things the worst impact of covid will likely be in the countries with the least resources eg africa see article on wired magazine on sequencing of virus from cambodia top takeaways o at this point we are past containment containment is basically futile our containment efforts wont reduce the number who get infected in the us o now were just trying to slow the spread to help healthcare providers deal with the demand peak in other words the goal of containment is to flatten the curve to lower the peak of the surge of demand that will hit

bottom line there is not enough testing capacity to be broadly useful heres why o currently there is no way to determine what a person has other than a pcr test no other test can yet distinguish covid from flu or from the other dozen respiratory bugs that are circulating o a polymerase chain reaction pcr test can detect covids rna however they still dont have confidence in the tests specificity ie they dont know the rate of false negatives o the pcr test requires kits with reagents and requires clinical labs to process the kits o while the kits are becoming available the lab capacity is not growing o the leading clinical lab firms quest and labcore have capacity to process  kits per day for the nation o expanding processing capacity takes time space and equipment and certification ie it wont happen soon o ucsf and ucberkeley have donated their research labs to process kits but each has capacity to process only  kits per day and are not clinically certified o novel test methods are on the horizon but not here now and wont be at any scale to be useful for the present danger  how well is society preparing for the impact o local hospitals are adding capacity as we speak ucsfs parnassus campus has erected triage tents in a parking lot they have converted a ward to negative pressure which is needed to contain the virus they are considering reopening the shuttered mt zion facility o if covid affected children then we would be seeing mass departures of families from cities but thankfully now we know that kids are not affected o school closures are one the biggest societal impacts we need to be thoughtful before we close schools especially elementary schools because of the knockon effects if elementary kids are not in school then some hospital staff cant come to work which decreases hospital capacity at a time of surging demand for hospital services o public health systems are prepared to deal with shortterm outbreaks that last for weeks like an outbreak of meningitis they do not have the capacity to sustain for outbreaks that last for months other solutions will have to be found o what will we do to handle behavior changes that can last for months many employees will need to make accommodations for elderly parents and those with underlying conditions and immunesuppressed kids home due to school closures o dr derisi had to leave the meeting for a call with the governors office when he returned we asked what the call covered the epidemiological models the state is using to track and trigger action the state is planning at what point they will take certain actions ie what will trigger an order to cease any gatherings of over  people  where do you find reliable news o the john hopkins center for health security site which posts daily updates the site says you can sign up to receive a daily newsletter on covid by email i tried and the page times out due to high demand after three more tries i was successful in registering for the newsletter o the new york times is good on scientific accuracy  observations on china o unlike during sars chinas scientists are publishing openly and accurately on covid o while chinas early reports on incidence were clearly low that seems to trace to their data management systems being overwhelmed not to any bad intent o wuhan has  beds per thousand while us has  beds per thousand wuhan built  additional hospitals in  weeks even so most patients were sent to gymnasiums to sleep on cots o early on no one had info on covid so china reacted in a way unique modern history except in wartime  every few years there seems another sars ebola mers hn covid growing strains of antibiotic resistant bacteria are we in the twilight of a century of medicines great triumph over infectious disease o weve been in a back and forth battle against viruses for a million years o but it would sure help if every country would shut down their wet markets o as with many things the worst impact of covid will likely be in the countries with the least resources eg africa see article on wired magazine on sequencing of virus from cambodia,1

well gang we are flying over the target an anonymous editorial in today is cct exemplifies the danger of articulating an opinion without a sound fact base which actually will help us crisp up our appeal for those who are using modernist arguments from the s to address planning issues that concern the st century this group this neighborhood and our supporters from all over the townincluding many in the region and the commonwealthhave all all understood that th  e engagement here is not about rushing to save every old building it is about repairing a regulatory and zoning defect that has been a burden to the village for almost  years we are fully aware that some buildings are either not able or worth being saved and we do not want to live in a  scale model of a longdead culture what we do want is some common sense about how we move ahead and plopping massive boxbox stores in the middle of an area dotted with magnificently detailed buildings that have defined its ethos for  years is the antithesis of responsible stewardship and intelligent planning this is not exclusively about the past it is about the futureabout getting regulatory relief from a problem that beset our parents we seek the same kind of zoning protections other areas in harwich and on the cape already enjoy nothing more and nothing less the author is unaware of the long paper trail that attended the opening of the old friendly is in the early s the uproar caused by the potential of placing a burger king on the row in the s to say nothing of the hubbub around the cynical real estate investment strategy that involves buying historic buildings and then allowing them to wither way by neglect this area doubtless has traces from the earliest english settlers in the s and the native americans who were here well before all the way down through th th th and th centuries it has been a vibrant commercial area we do not think that this needs to come to an end what has to change are the regulatory structures that would serve speculative commercial exercises at the expense of those who have chosen to live here because of the historic texture of the area there is a middle road and that is what we seeka restoration of suitablyscaled commerce this is not a romantic crusade but a common sense approach to keeping what makes our village and our town uniqueour historic character our scale our charm and our beauty the urgency to which the author refers is a sensitivity that was brought forth by the board of selectmen which as a body is looking for guidance from the planning community about how to use the cape cod commission is toolkit to enact precisely the kind of protocols that will solve this issue once and for all so far from being the hobbyhorse of a handful of local home owners this has a townwide impact finally neighbors have indeed put their money where their collective mouths are and have indeed approached owners largely unresponsive of distressed properties from the very beginning in fact the groups has been fully aware of the fact that the real answer here is how the market will value our efforts in the mean time we suggest that this anonymous author take a few moments to get informed at the current exhibit at dedicated to the houses of captains row at the harwich historical society then run over to the watercolor exhibit of visions of captains row at the harwich cultural center then view the captains of captains row video on youtube and perhaps join up on the next scheduled walking tour of captains row there is nothing better for an illformed and shallow opinion than a bracing injection of factual reality,1

"ive been getting a lot of feedback from yesterday is commissioners court meeting a lot happened under the topics of public health property tax exemptions and vote by mail elections community impactkaty carried several key points that i made during the meeting and i want to give more information here also
on the county judge is public health emergency declaration i voted against extending this till june th because both our county auditor and our emergency management coordinator testified to the court that it is not a necessary designation for fort bend county the county judge has said that he needs to keep it in place for obtaining funding from federal and state sources but our experts testified that is not the case the reason that this vote ended up as a  split is because an emergency declaration allows the county judge to continue transacting business and spending money without court approval i dont see an overwhelming reason why the spending authority of the taxpayers money isnt already restored to the full commissioners court commissioner meyers joined me in this vote because he believes the same thing the people of fort bend county need the freedom to get back to normal as they see fit the county needs to start getting back to normal also
during this same discussion the commissioners also heard from hhs director dr jacquelyn minter she agreed with my assessment that the county needs to immediately reevaluate the use and cost of some of the countyrun covid testing sites two of our locations are dramatically underutilized dr minter said that the county is working to restructure resources and tests to mobile sites to go directly to areas that need them ill be sharing that information as soon as the schedule becomes available
on property tax exemptions the court voted unanimously to enact the maximum homestead exemption were allowed to grant under texas law the county is exemption represents a  tax break on the value of your home and an additional k tax break for property owners over the age of  and the disabled the explosion of property valuations from the cad this year make this exemption worth more than ever and ill continue to visit and ask more taxing entities in fort bend county to grant larger exemptions like the county does right now only the city of katy has the same maximum homestead exemption for property owners and most muds dont have any homestead exemption at all
on vote by mail elections i voted against the motion to support full vote by mail elections and commissioner meyers joined with me for another  split vote i still remember when president carter and his bipartisan commission stated in  absentee ballots remain the largest source of potential voter fraud and i still believe that he is correct i also believe that both the texas supreme court and the us supreme court are going to put a halt to the attempt to expand vote by mail to the entire state of texas this year instead of focusing on the lawyers and courts on the theoretical your precinct  staff are working to come up with real solutions to the realworld priorities of voting this year more voting locations more elections workers more ppe and distancing at the voting locations if heb and walmart locations can handle thousands of people every hour so can our elections that is where ill be focusing my efforts so we can do our best to get ahead and get people voting confidently in the upcoming elections",1

"merkel is dictation
democracy is closed
what is going on in germany the chancellor refuses to discuss this at state level she is not in the mood for discussions you say snotty
the chancellor is activities are drifting more and more into a dictate of omnipotence and its specifications this behavior is not worthy of the office because it is more reminiscent of the sandbox games of a fiveyearold or just the role models from the old days of the gdr the chancellor orders the federal states to more or less follow their draft resolutions demands a uniform approach and action under her direction although there are very large regional differences and needs
what do we have in germany now monarchy dictatorship no we elected this sed miracle girl from the past to the highest office in the republic queen merkel has ruled over the obedient majority for almost  years and is well on her way to hypnotically throwing everyone under the plates
the real question is when is enough
we are kept in check for weeks with false reports from the virologist droste schools are closed childcare services withdrawn although the results have been different for weeks
accusesvirologistsoffalsestudyontheviralloadofchildren 
they decided to stigmatize us by considering the necessary acceptance for dictatorial features as meaningful it has come to this in this country democracy is only on the packaging the pandemic has paved the way to omnipotence
the regulatory authorities are used against us for the purpose of complying with and implementing alleged protective measures although we are systemically and regionally completely different from italy spain france and belgium not to mention the broken savings and nonexistent social systems like in the usa russia and china the only thing that can be recognized equally is the behavior of the government towards omnipotence and oppression
this government does not deserve a vote this government especially ms merkel acts dictatorially and beyond moral responsibility when faced with emergencies far greater collateral damage is produced than how protection is exercised on the citizen one likes to cite the example of italyalthough it lacks any systemic basis
this is no longer the country it was in  like  where you could still feel the cohesion and the cornerstones of democracy

the man who lived the pain of organ transplant patients he wasnt just like any other he was different from what weve known so far he had set a very high threshold because he unlike other activists put himself in the front of the suffering he carried the suffering of organ transplant patients on his shoulders lived their pain and even paid a high personal price just so he could save lives sometimes i wonder to myself how much are we willing to pay in order to help ot  hers in need medical practice is an issue that requires sacrifice time resources and dedication  but on the other hand it is mentally rewarding and entails satisfaction that there is no greater than it  saving life a few weeks ago rabbi heber a highly righteous man may his memory be forever blessed visited my office presenting me with another medical emergency case and we together joined forces to help this person face his medical challenge i looked at him during the meeting we had and felt great admiration i admired him not just because of the  organ transplant patients that got their lives back but because of that horrific year he lived through in which he was arrested under constant investigations dealt with terrible news reports of suspected organ trafficking  all this just to be notified a year later that the case would be closed down and all allegations dropped i thought then whether any of us were willing to bear this amount of suffering for others in such a medical need most medical practitioners would have slammed the door to such slander to this kind activity but rabbi heber saw only the goal of saving lives before him and continued to move ahead he did not just continue helping others successfully he even impressed one of his investigators that he finally decided to donate a kidney rabbi heber was an amazing bridge between worlds he himself belonged to the ultraorthodox sector most of the kidney donors he recruited came from the religiousnational sector with emphasis on judea and samaria regionsand most of the patients who got the organ donations belonged to the general sector  from a variety of population strata not only did he affect the organ transplant patients that got their lives back he also completely changed the lives of the  donors who gave their own organ to an anonymous person in spite of the process that it entails its beyond any level of giving it is the willingness to endure for another it is the supreme standard that was set by rabbi heber and perhaps it was also the secret of his success may his pure and holy memory be blessed forever the writer is the chairman of the lemaanchem organization under the auspices of the mafli laasot society and avraham noson amp shushana scharf fund which provides free medical advice and guidance the original post was published on israel hayom,1

for immediate release house candidate inskip sets record straight after hayden makes false statements cottage grove ore  on wednesday october th while conducting a radio interview on knnd am  the republican incumbent candidate for oregon house district  representative cedric hayden made false statements regarding his opponent democratic nominee christy inskip in response to haydens comments inskip had this to say these statements about me are false more than anything i find it disappointing that rep hayden lied on the air for his own benefit the fact is while in oregon i have worked solely for lane county public health as the tobacco prevention and education program coordinator for nearly  years and do not nor have i ever worked for any special interest group this is an easily proven fact as a government employee i am not allowed to lobby i do not work for special interests i work for public interests as a public servant i work for the people of our communities my opponent is attacking me for truly caring about the individual people of district  he believes that advocating for their right to earn fair wages makes be beholden to some special interest on this point i agree with my opponent i am beholden to the working people of district  and i will proudly carry their interest to salem i will not be intimidated by special interests for advocating for those who cant afford to line my pockets it is time to finally deliver a voice to the people of district  and actually work for responsible communityfocused economic growth i am not ashamed of my allegiance to the working families of district  and will fight to create more family wage jobs support local small businesses increase access to quality affordable healthcare lower the cost of prescription medication improve our education system and develop more affordable housing i will fight for our rural working families fair share in the legislature and not special interest groups that hayden represents in response inskip is making the following facts public  christy inskip has never been employed by a special interest group of any kind  christy inskip works for the lane county department of health and human services in the public health division and through her work personally pays dues to be a member of oregon afscme local  under no circumstance either legally or colloquially does her membership in her union constitute employment  christy inskip is not nor will ever be beholden to any special interest and refuses to accept money from corporations or companies or front groups connected to the tobacco pharmaceutical or other industries that harm oregonians she has consistently campaigned on supporting oregon working families  christy inskip did attend the oregon labor candidate school a choice she made to help her learn the complexities of navigating a campaign the oregon labor candidate school is a nonpartisan nonprofit organization aimed at helping individuals who advocate for working families and strive to improve our economic security through living wages retirement security affordable quality healthcare and an excellent education system to be successful candidates christy did this because she understands the advantage of continually learning how to be the most responsive communityminded candidate she can be afscme did not in any way send her or pay for her to attend this learning opportunity  afscme contributed to inskips campaign because one of her core platform issues is at the heart of why organized labor unions exist  to fight for improved working conditions and compensation for oregon workers contributions made to her campaign represent the thousands of afscme members who support proworker prolabor candidates across the state let the record show that the vast majority of inskips campaign contributions are from friends family members and community members who believe inskip will fight to improve the quality of life for working families inskips campaign has been funded by nearly  different donors giving an average contribution of  it is unclear why rep hayden decided to make these blatantly false statements especially given his own record of accepting campaign contributions from special interest groups the pharmaceutical tobacco soda and timber industries and his demonstrated success in salem representing those special interest groups  his voting record shows who he is working for in salem,1

he would abolish abortion and eliminate funding for planned parenthood

take a look because this will help you better understand who your prospect is and what the biggest opportunity is in your market when i present this idea of prospect awareness to our clients amp students i present it as a pyramid on the bottom of the pyramid is the unaware prospect thats the biggest part of the market when you go up a level the area shrinks and then you go up another level and as you move up and up the size of the marketplace  the number of people at that level  decreases but it becomes easier to convert them as we go down levels  to the bottom unaware layer of the pyramid  that is our biggest opportunity because its the biggest universe there are more people but the reason its harder to convert at the bottom is because there is a lot more belief that we have to create in the minds of our prospects and this is the thing that i want to share with you today what prospects need to be educated and which do not the individual who is at the top or close to the top already has existing beliefs  they have understanding and insights this guy  on the other hand when an individual is completely unaware like this guy  we have to lead them through the entire string of beliefs there are things we have to say to them that we dont have to say to the person who is at the problem level of awareness for example the individual who is at the problem level of awareness we dont have to educate them to the fact that they have a problem they know they have a problem theyre already aware of the fact that they have a problem the person who goes on google and searches for flood repair  or something like that already knows they have a problem whereas the person who is unaware that there is flooding going on behind the sheetrock we have to educate them thats one additional belief  in this simplistic example  that we have to establish with that individual and still the higher up on the level of awareness the fewer beliefs that we have to establish because theyve already been established on the lower awareness level how direct do you need to be in your message the last thing i really want you to start to see is that as you go higher on the levels of awareness the more direct you can be in your ideas and talk for the funnel so for instance lets say we have a prospect who is aware that they have had a flood and theyve got damage and they need it repaired and now theyre searching on google for flood repair with a certain type of method for that person we dont have to start with an indirect big idea that is slanted toward being intellectually interesting and invoking curiosity instead jump into their thought process at a place thats appropriate for them lets begin the dialogue there whereas for the unaware individual we cant start like that we cant jump in and have an ad that says what you need to know about flood repair or the six reasons why we can get your home back to its original condition in  hours or less guaranteed you cant start there with the completely unaware because they are unaware we have to take the scenic route and thats what brings me back to why the lower you are on the awareness scale the more difficult it is to convert because we need to establish more beliefs in that type of prospect and we need to have a big marketing idea that takes the scenic route we need to find a big marketing idea that is intellectually interesting to create a level of engagement so that eventually we can lead them into the direct hook something such as here are the five reasons why you want us but we cant start there with the unaware understanding prospect levels of awareness is the key to being able to create the right message at the right time get this right and youll have them lining up at your door so the question is how do you find a big marketing idea that grabs attention and allows you to acquire new customers even in the most competitive markets if you are serious about capitalizing on this biggest and most untapped opportunity in the market i strongly suggest you grab a copy of my new book it is called how to find your big marketing idea and it is just  on the next page this will be a total game changer for you,1

alberta is it time to consider life without canada i was born into a working generation that was just  years old within our peaceful borders it may be difficult to believe that it was a bloody fight to get there it caused arguments heated debates fist fights threats and deep divisions among familys but ultimately it was the women that decided the vote when the government of canada promised mothers the child tax credit money in your hand every month to feed your c  hildren the choice was easy and obvious it was a secret ballet and i suspect many of the women of the time never told their husbands fathers and grandfathers where they placed their x but shared a secret comforting smile with their children when they heard the results i am obviously referring to the vote for newfoundland a country at the time to join canada looking back it was one of the best decisions my parents as country of newfoundland citizens ever made newfoundland was in economic turmoil and had few logical choices but with a vote of  to  it took heart and courage to make the decision to join confederation a country that became a province but what if the opposite occurred what if a province became a country what if alberta was a country do we have the wealth and know how to make the choice that other provinces dont have could we bring saskatchewan and north eastern bc all the way to the coast with us would they join us is it possible can it legally be done should it be done i dont consider myself a separatist i am loyal to the maple leaf i have sworn to protect my country and i have proudly saluted my flag while serving my country so i will call myself a realist instead i believe it is time for alberta to start the open discussion on what life would look like without canada relationships always end in a divorce when one side seems to give more to the relationship than is being received is that the relationship that we have with the rest of canada do we give more than we receive there is an energy east pipeline its apparently very efficient and stocked with alberta dollars flowing directly to ottawa for redistribution to the rest of canada the amount we sent down the oneway line last year is estimated at  billion what do we get for that when we get the invoice for services rendered from ottawa what in on the invoice besides pay this amount when i spend  bucks on something i want to know what i am getting if i was to spend a  with the big b that being a billion verses a buck i would really want the know what i was paying for certainly national defense and a federal police force quickly come to mind both very important from a safety and security perspective with a federal defense budget of  billion annually and a rcmp budget of less than half a billion we may be over contributing a federal transportation board for all the trucks we see on the highways moving oil to the rail and supporting our infrastructure come to mind the railway to get our oil to the coast aviation the dying cbc that we watch once a week for  months a year on saturday nights or special events immigration because thats going so well the federally financed coast guard isnt so important to a land locked province but we would give anything for a route to some beach front west coast property right now the point being i cant think of one thing that canada does for us in our relationship with ottawa that we cant do ourselves and do better trudeau did take a step towards building the trans mountain pipeline by having the federal government owe it by having ownership he can declare it a project of national interest in the house of commons vote on it and push it thru no matter what the courts say it is an option one he has yet to exercise my thoughts are he is waiting on cannabis sales if that will sufficiently contribute to stock federal coffers to pay for the many social programs he has bouncing around between his ears alberta oil revenue will not be required for reelection i suspect junior doesnt have the same testicular fortitude of his father to force built the pipeline he will not look into the camera and say the famous words of his father when discussing a few terrorists just watch me unless of course there is an opportunity for a selfie with a beaver cannabis in hand while in a kayak then the caption could be just watch me and the beaver but never said with the same intent pipe lined energy or vigor so that leaves the people of alberta  billion short with another invoice for  plus billion coming and a growing deficit to leave our children is it time for our leadership to nudge the federal decision making process or even test if there is serious decision coming by openly discussing options for alberta we could temporarily stop these transfer payments and have the discussion on what alberta would look like without canada can we make it on our own we already attract some of the best and brightest to our universitys and schools to study and to do research i believe that the options are endless for alberta to attract people and to lead the world in science research clean energy and economics there is nothing that albertans the ones born here and the ones who have earned the right to say that i am from alberta cant do we just have a different attitude than our east  west cousinswe have the strong backs minds and hearts if we keep our own money we have the time resources and people to do it i am all about helping my neighbor but when i need a helping hand and my neighbor turns his back on me my desire to contribute to my neighbors hospitals schools and general upkeep of his lawn diminishes alberta has attracted the best and the brightest from all parts of canada for years the question on alberta job sites is where do you live the reply being i live in edmonton calgary grande prairie or fort mcmurray but i am from nova scotia saskatoon montreal toronto or vancouver this province was built by canadians from all colors backgrounds and beliefs but it may be better to have its future maintained and build solely by albertans lets have the conversation lets send the message to our neighbors lets have the plebiscite,1

if you run a business and buy traffic online read this at the beginning of  we lost  worth of revenue that was coming in each day this was a big shock to our cash flow but we never panicked we had  ads shut down by google overnight on their display platform yes google did account for majority of our traffic but it didnt account for all of it the reason why this didnt completely cripple our business is simply because we believe that diversifying your traffic is crucial to your business surviving for a long time  this is something that has allowed us to keep our businesses running for just over  years the reality is that no single source of traffic will last forever  at one point or another networks make major changes to their traffic and to their policy which can have devastating effects on your business but if you make it a priority to have multiple sources of alternative traffic running you will never have the lights completely shut off when google shut down all of our ads we were smart enough to have alternative traffic sources generating sales profitably so that we could continue running the business the alternative traffic that kept us running until we could get things sorted out with google is what we like to call intent traffic this is highly targeted traffic that you can get for just pennies in comparison to the bigger networks we are talking clicks for as cheap as  implementing intent traffic into your business is a nobrainer and it very well might save you one day like it did for us if you want to learn more about intent traffic and how you can implement it into your business today then click below join my free workshop where i show you exactly how we used intent traffic to still generate  leads and k in revenue when  of our google traffic was paused join free workshop gt,1

"next generation ue
ursula von der leyen president of the european commission presented the plan developed for the recovery of countries affected by the coronavirus crisis
the commission is proposal is a recovery fund of  billion euros of which  nonrepayable and  in the form of loans in addition to the  already put in place through other formulas including the mes which however no state has yet asked
the eu would finance itself on the markets and the debt will be repaid between  and  through the joint post budget
obviously we are only at the beginning because this program will have to be voted on and accepted by all  eu members and therefore overcome the clear opposition of the countries that are absolutely not available to provide nonrepayable funds but only to loans with conditionality
italy would touch  billion of which  in the form of aid and  in loans
a unanimous chorus of applause rose from gentiloni eu commissioner for the economy from sassoli president of the european parliament from conte president of the italian council from zingaretti pd secretary from amendola minister for regional affairs and all spoke of the occasion historical
instead something is not friendly and it is likely to ask a few questions
why was another  billion added to be repaid to the initial francogerman proposal for nonrefundable  billion aid
and because italy which is not in a position to contract other debts is assigned as many as  which is more than a third of the entire sum and because you have to take the whole package and you cannot opt for the single share a lost fund
i would not want the government that will accept these conditions it will do so with a light heart thinking that then others will have the problem from  onwards while it will find itself managing an enormous wealth and using it by doing favors to friends and friends of friends while on the other hand it would be advisable not to make welfare but to program a serious and articulated development plan that takes into account above all the backwardness of the south of agricultural commercial industrial and tourist development with overcoming the pachydermic bureaucracy that penalizes us so much and that they created the same politicians
a great cadeau and nobody talks about it is what france and germany have done which with the excuse of helping countries in difficulty have tailored aid of  and  billion free respectively
even for the socalled frugal states sums of up to  billion nonrepayable funds are envisaged perhaps in an attempt to soften and calm them down
the typical european mentality everyone thinks about doing their own interests
that is all from italy good day",1

running ads of a political nature in america right now lets you see the pain and frustration people are feeling the comments we read are filled with emotions from hope to all out rage given the style of politics we have had for over a decade now it is easy to understand why by themselves each of the two major parties represent less than a third of the population is it ever going to work for either party to try and impose their will on the whole country metaphorically we  re in a big relationship fight weve escalated to the point of if you dont agree with me then im out of here it seems like were in that point of the fight where were so dug in that were ready to break up or get divorced now ask ourselves these questions what will happen if we do not resolve this fight what if it did lead to divided nations would we have the same military might if we were smaller separate economies if our adversaries wanted to destroy us what would we do if we were attacked while were in the middle of fighting with ourselves what would we do if we were attacked after becoming bitterly separated nations we would certainly be more vulnerable and would lose the strength we have today in the world is that the outcome we really want for those who dont think dividing ourselves further is the right directionhow can we start to come back together without compromising on our beliefs there is certainly plenty of blame to go around and we know many people will focus on that in the comments but in our personal lives has anyone ever resolved a bitter fight by forcing the other person to give up their beliefs has anyone ever resolved a fight by reinforcing that its the other persons fault resolving a fight starts with small steps that usually dont focus on the things that caused the fight lets be honest were not going to start by coming together on the hot button issues our nerves are too raw right now and it is understandable because there really are some issues where we have strong differences of opinion its hard for us to see right now how wed work together without compromising on our own sense of right and wrong so let us not start there instead there are some issues where were not so different if we start working together on those issues we can start to cut the tension and division we feel and just like in the moments after we resolve a fight we could start to see the other person as a someone we care about again even if we cannot imagine that right now at that time we might be in a better emotional state to find solutions we can agree on for today is hot button issues that do not require us to compromise on our values if we the people are encouraging our elected officials to fight with each other then that is exactly what they are going to do but if we the people are united in our support of what we want no one would stay in office long without getting in line over  conservative moderate and liberal americans have already committed to working together on the issues where we agreeand we are growing we are going to voice our support together on those issues to our representatives in washington check out our site to learn more about how we are doing it,1

this is us taking pride in our diverse family in todays culture diversity is a word that is thrown around frequently especially when it comes to politics and newscasters it is my belief that there is much more acceptance of diversity than many people actually see or are even willing to acknowledge as an example i would ask that you take a look at my family for that matter i challenge you to look at many of the families in our own delaware county there is much more t  han meets the eye at first glance yes my husband gary is likely one of the white anglo saxon protestants we read about in our history books but for a man who grew up poor in what was then a small town in oklahoma he has a great world view much of that comes from paying his own way through college by working  hours a week during school and more in the summer hauling hay and picking okra for as long as i have known him gary has had an open mind to new ideas and to acceptance of all kinds of people first of all gary married me maybe i look the part of all white america but i am particularly proud of my native american heritage unlike one particular presidential candidate i can prove my heritage my maternal grandfather was born in indian territory what is now oklahoma to a full blood cherokee mother unfortunately my great grandmother had to register with the tribe as a half breed just so she would be able to sell her land so i am now registered as  cherokee when i should be ��� i wish i had learned more about that side of the family when people were alive to tell me but as is too often the case hindsight is  i am also half german my paternal grandparents were first generation americans who always loved their country with lots of problems in trying to have children our first child was adopted valerie was five days old and absolutely beautiful oh did i mention she was also biracial at that time oklahoma was still considered a bible belt state not many people went around mixing the races unless it was with native americans yes we encountered a few puzzled looks and a few questions from people we didnt know but for the most part our daughter was accepted as a child of god who was going to be raised in a loving home and isnt that what is most important for all of us five years later we were blessed with a biological child another girl who was just as beautiful of course this daughter is also registered with the cherokee tribe even if she looks a bit scandanavian with her blond hair and blue eyes our older daughter grew up and married a man who was also racially mixed their children are two of our treasures a grandson who is about my color a light brown and a granddaughter who is a beautiful tan color both children have their moms contagious smile and laugh like their mother they can win people over with their bright personalities our younger daughter has two handsome boys who also have her blond hair and blue eyes the boys are nine and seven and even though many people ask if they are twins they are as different as night and day yes the boys could be registered with the cherokees and are the last ones eligible in that line several years ago after the girls were grown we decided to adopt a boy because we were going to be older parents we were excluded from many adoption possibilities finally it all came down to guatemala our son had just turned three when he came to ohio about a year ago our son wanted to do one of those ancestry dna tests he was pleased to find out that he was nearly  mayan he turns  this july and is well on his way to becoming an electrician oftentimes we have had the whole family in a restaurant and i have wanted to ask the wait staff if they could identify who is related to whom add in one of my nephews who is married to a philippine woman and there is even more variety we are certainly a motley crew incorporating many of the shades seen in the graphic above but again does it really matter no we love and accept each other and that is what is important for those of you who think this family dynamic is uncommon i challenge you to be hyper observant the next time you are at one of our local kroger or department stores or the next time you attend a parade or festival in one of delaware countys communities or first friday in delaware city or even visit the polaris mall or the tanger outlets you are going to see many families like ours maybe the difference between us and the newscasters is that we accept diversity as a part of everyday life we dont have to make an issue of diversity because there isnt one as the popular tv show title says this is us written by cathy merrell,1

today videos of white nationalists or crimes against minorities are shown in the news and on social media frequently news reports of children torn from parents have been catching headlines people talk about how ridiculous the idea of a border wall is and some  are suggesting that no human being is illegal ie anyone should be able to come and have the opportunity to live in america and enjoy it as any citizen would suggesting migration controls tends to bring up the words starting this article and one underlying theme seems to be that the current president has caused undercover racism to come out into the open and even created racism among people where there once was little to none after all its suggested that the united states has always welcomed immigrants in a white house press briefing the cnn reporter jim acosta spoke about the statue of liberty and how inscribed on it are the words give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free it definitely sounds inspiring so lets take a look at the immigration policies of the united states in the past how governments debate create and enforce immigration laws and a generally more detailed picture of what is being discussed go to new york and you can see people of all colors with many different languages being spoken i remember as a child being taught in a school textbook that new york was considered the melting pot of the us we learned about how immigrants came to ellis island from europe and contributed to the country that we know today what wasnt in the textbook was the fact that immigration policy at the time was actually much less open and was much more strict than today explicitly excluding many asian immigrants while being more open to those viewed as more similar in culture and skin tone  the europeans if you really think about it this shouldnt be very surprising if american society discriminated and discriminates today against those of african descent why not others in fact even those white europeans faced discrimination and there were calls for more controls on immigration to the us as more immigrants came in  the emergency quota act was put into law which explicitly restricted the annual number of immigrants from any one country to  of the total from that country counted in the us census of  then in  a stricter law was enacted lowering that  to  and only allowing that percentage from the lower number in the us census of  that doesnt sound like we were so willing to take in all those huddled masses as jim acosta said obviously this has come up before and nothing seriously suggested today by the white house or congress comes close to explicitly restricting immigration as was done during the time we had started to supposedly become such a melting pot and bastien of open borders and people of many colors and cultures beyond those schoolbook lies the reality of immigration and how countries control flows of people became more apparent to me over the years i remember hearing of illegal immigrants working in the crop fields of my small hometown in georgia when i was still in elementary school at the time i had just moved to rural georgia from the washington dc area where i had spent the prior years i have visual memories of seeing hispanic workers in the hot sunbaked fields picking cabbage and other crops and of them coming in old schoolbuses to the local walmart shopping supercenter to buy groceries and other necessities one day i remember they formed a line in the parking lot and at the front of the line was a towel laid on the pavement with loaves of bread and packs of what looked like bologna a couple people put the sandwiches together handed them to the person at the front of the line and the next person came forward to get their sandwich their clothes were tattered and i dont remember hearing them speak english it was common knowledge that they worked very hard and accepted low wages for that pay for farmers and contractors it was a winwin more labor for less money when i worked at a beef manufacturing plant when i was  the next station on the factory line was all staffed by mexican immigrants they couldnt speak english but we became good friends joked and helped each other make the day go by faster i even learned a little spanish mostly bad words my hometown in georgia also had immigrants from india who owned many or most of the gas stations in the town after moving to ny several years later i began to be exposed to more immigrants now from all over the world my own father came from baghdad iraq in  to the united states but it was when i moved to japan that i became much more directly aware and involved with immigration before then i didnt know much about what a visa was but now i knew that a visa was a temporary permit for residency given to you by the country as an immigrant i remembered asian friends in ny telling me about their difficulties in getting visas for work in the us now that i had to get a visa myself i learned a visa would dictate what you had been granted temporary residency for work school marriage to a citizen etc it also stated the period of time the permit was valid  for a period of months years or indefinitely now it was clear to me that nations controlled who came and went into their country you are told what you are allowed to do under that arrangement such as work in specific jobs and how long you are allowed to stay in parliaments across europe in congress in the us worldwide this is something that is discussed and debated among all political parties with clear rules and limits put into place in fact this comes full circle to a fact the news almost always fails to ensure the public is reminded we have immigration controls and so do all other nations you cannot simply go to another country and decide you will now live there in fact in many you cannot even visit without applying directly to the immigration bureau of that country it is a crucial role of a government to control its borders and the flow of people through it imagine if the us simply let anyone into the country the policy would be if you can get here you can stay and work and would be granted all the rights of domestic citizens people would flood into the country from other nations probably mostly poorer nations because they would want to take the opportunity to show that they can work hard and are hungry to make a better life for themselves housing costs would likely go up wages would likely go down  it would probably not work very well for the prior domestic residents if youve stayed up late at night youve probably seen the commercials where for only a penny a day you can sponsor a poor child in a poor country this is a sad reality  its been said that half of the worlds population lives on less than  per day the amount of struggling poor around the globe is much much larger than the number of people in the us the idea of a union of countries with blanket access and free movement of people to live and work is something that has been done right now the european union is comprised of  countries with this free movement policy called the schengen area one key distinction must be made these  are not the most impoverished nations in the world so the free movement of people from for example subsaharan africa does not come under the terms of this agreement however the eu has allowed many refugees from syria or africa to settle in the region this has created huge debate and controversy with political parties promoting less immigration garnering more support and winning elections in hungary and slovenia this has become a reality against the will of the governing body of the eu those nations have installed border fences and walls to prevent those from coming into their countries spain has also done the same italy has had immigration at the forefront of its recent elections apparently the notion of a border barrier such as a wall is not out of the ordinary one big event came in  which is very similar and related to the immigration debate put forth in donald trumps campaign in june of that year the citizens of the united kingdom voted to leave the eu many analysts and research suggested the single largest issue for citizens and the vote out was the policy of open borders to anyone from this immigration union of  nations clearly the issue of immigration is not confined to the united states  this has become a global issue in spite of the fact that construction at the border is going on around the world the idea that the government construct a wall on our border is portrayed as ridiculous by many news organizations the uks vote to leave the eu seemed to stem from legal immigration however in the us illegal immigration tends to get much more media attention so how do immigrants become illegal in the us the two most prevalent ways are crossing the border without going through a checkpoint such as in the desert or through a tunnel or being issued a visa granted for a set period but then staying inside the country beyond that allowed period going from legal resident to illegal resident in  there were approximately  border arrests from people doing this the number of people successful is less clear and is estimated to be anywhere from  to  another way people gain access is by claiming asylum although the numbers of people doing so is far less to attain refugee status after claiming asylum an individual must prove they fit the following criteria an individual must have suffered persecution or fear suffering persecution because of race religion nationality political opinion or membership in a particular social group what is often left out is the attitude towards immigrants and asylees in mexico mexico deports many who try to enter their own borders a report this year from amnesty international found that  of immigrants were not informed of their right to seek asylum even though it is required by mexican law the country also deported more immigrants per capita than the united states only  of mexicos population is foreign whereas the uss number is around  its even stated in mexican law that the country may deny entry to anyone in order to maintain its demographic balance mexico also much more easily grants visas to those from wealthier countries at the same time the government has published literature in the past advising illegal immigrants in the united states on how to avoid us immigration officials for a country that chastises the administration for the idea of a border wall this all sounds hypocritical there is also the issue of children being held in detention centers in the us the news media makes it seem as if this began since the election however this has been publicized and ongoing under past administrations such as the obama administration under which the record number of deportations occurred additionally the government tries to release most children to sponsors such as family while this is definitely something the government should address framing seems to be more popular than discussing realities the facts on immigration never seem to be laid bare in mainstream news articles if this has been ongoing with child detainees why hasnt this been addressed before what should the government do to more fairly accommodate those detained who illegally reside in the us while also deterring illegal immigration discussions shouldnt always include racist remarks of drug dealers or rapists  many simply want to live a better life however it also shouldnt include racist or bigot for suggesting that a line be drawn  there has always been a line drawn for all countries,1

last week the us senate voted to strike down a rule that would have allowed americans to file classaction suits against banks instead of being forced in many cases into private arbitration the final vote was a tie that was broken by vice president mike pence all but two republicans john kennedy of louisiana and lindsey graham of south carolina voted to repeal the rule no democrats or independents supported the move the us house had passed similar legislation in ju  ly the rule was revealed in july by the consumer financial protection bureau and supported by democrats and consumer advocates but opposed by banking lobbyists the new rule was set to take effect in  and would have restored the right of individuals to sue in court it was part of a series of actions by the bureau which has cracked down on debt collectors the student loan industry and payday lenders supporters praised this rule for giving average people more power to fight industry abuses such as wells fargo amp cos creation of millions of unauthorized accounts but banking lobbyists the us chamber of commerce and the us treasury department argued that the rule would unleash a flood of classaction lawsuits and that the cost of fighting those suits would be passed on to consumers the arbitration rule was the first major check on arbitration since a pair of supreme court decisions in  and  allowed its widespread use and resulted in arbitration clauses appearing in tens of millions of contracts as a result the consumer financial protection bureau mandated a study on arbitration and found that once blocked from suing few people went to arbitration at all and the results for those who did were dismal during the twoyear period studied only  arbitration claims resulted in judgments in favor of consumers who got  in total relief its sad that we were so close to a win for everyday consumers in this country being able to have legal standing to fight big banks but that was taken away the republican majority in washington would rather serve as a champion for the banks rather than american citizens,1

 faster decision making the larger the organization the slower the decision making process we may come to the same the very same decision but it has more layers
 faster communication
 closer community precovid  i went with one of my mega church pastor friends at a major sporting event as we were walking out a random guy yelled at him hey there is my pastor my friend turned to me and had no clue who the guy was so i would say that i have a relationship with everyone where he was not able to have a relationship with everyone i not only know their name but their stories as well
 simpler problem solving
 extreme personal touch show up in the moments and memories in their lives birthday parties weddings sports games
 pastor their community larger church pastor their church for the rural or small church the town becomes his parish god called you to pastor the town through the church
 small church can do ministry accompanied by their family you know you are a small church pastor because you are married to the worship leader wm is director and children is director kids play the drums clean the church mow the yard it is a family ministry
 the ability to personally influence people for ministry most of the pastoral influence is platform based influence is stronger in smaller settings young people personally know the pastor and often have opportunities to explore a sense of call to ministry
 enjoy a broader variety of ministry as a traditional shepherd while megachurch is often focused on being a visionary rural pastors get to spread their time out with preachingteachingcarecounselingadministration it is more people focused than system focused rural pastors have the opportunity to be generalists it is frustrating at times in terms of growth but it is also a blessing and keeps us sharp in discernment
 intimacy you have the ability to connect with your entire church know their stories and for them to feel connected personally to you you have the ability to speak weekly to each family personally and get very connected to their lives
 impact we only truly impact someone is life up close a small church pastor has the ability to dynamically impact the lives of each person in their flock that is especially powerful when it comes to the kids and youth you can connect with them and impact them powerfully
 importance of authenticity because of closeness it is crucial that you be authentic in all you dothere is no separation of life inside and outside the church your life will be inspected in every aspectmarriage parenting personal discipline etc you will have the chance to live by example people will model their marriage parenting and personal discipline from what they see in you
 sad to say but few will remember your sermons but they will remember those moments you touched them personally and you get to do that every week this is true for us bigger church pastors as wellfew remember the sermons everyone remembers the touch in their time of pain or confusion
 be the best you can bedo not use the statement we are too small for thatwhatever you do make it the best possible you cannot do everything but what you can do make it good
 focus on what you can do well and do not try to be a buffet of everything someone else is doing do not be afraid to say we do not do that if you spread the paint too thin nothing looks good

"recently someone asked me if being a physician if having the training and experience that ive had because of my profession has helped me in dealing with covid
it has
being a medical doctor gives me a different perspective i understand what is happening and what could happen if action is not taken i know the vocabulary the trends in epidemiology and the challenges faced by our medical community because i understand all of that so deeply i can make better and faster decisions
that is important because right now delaying a big decision could have catastrophic consequences in st louis county
that pressure might make some people uncomfortable but as an anesthesiologist it is my job to face actual lifeordeath situations and to make fast smart levelheaded decisions based on the best information ive got
it is my job to stay calm among the alarms beeping around me to focus and assess the situation to use the team around me to help me gather information and to make the decisions that need to be made to save a person is life
that is what i was trained to do it is what ive done throughout my professional life
and it is what has made me able to make the kinds of decisions that need to be made at the pace they need to be made right now
just as in a surgery we are in a moment when time is of the essence and we have to make fast smart levelheaded decisions to save people is lives of course we would like to have more time of course we would like to have more information but we will never have every piece of information we want and we cannot extend the deadline
we need to act
things work out strangely i am grateful to be in the position im in right now using my training and experience as we work around the clock doing everything we can to keep you and your family safe
and im especially grateful to every one of you who has written phoned or called to me in the street with your support it makes me stronger
we will get through this together",1

many people think the hail mary project  hmp is its own entity and people think that for good reason hmp is actually just a program that falls under a c tax exempt charitable organization per irs organization successlink in waterloo here is a quick maybe not so story of what was and what will soon beour foundation program outreach amp prevention is still in the process of being implemented supported and developed and it is not an easy task because o  f this hmp was born rather quickly to get our brand out there in the community but more importantly to provide us with an opportunity to identify and engage our target candidates we picked up incredible steam through this process  nothing that we ever anticipated happening this quickly but we did not have a relevant relatable and local corporate identity for many many months our board of directorsadvisory board met and we talked about the target date to apply for our own taxexempt status but we wanted to identify the right name something that rang through waterloo and genuinely meant something not just a name i kept telling everybody ill know it will be it when it comes to me months went by with no progress in april of this year a man by the name of robert j greenlee iii suddenly passed away he was a longtime veteran of the waterloo police department a former dare officers aka school resource officer sro and a leader within that department having gotten to know him to some extent the preceding six months prior to his passing i instantly knew this was it not because he was a cop but because of the type of person he was the type of man he was and how he truly impacted many people is lives and perceptions of law enforcement officers he was unlike many people in this world we live he did things not because of personal gain but because he believed in it despite whatever it was and how popular or unpopular it was this was a very admirable quality to me well fast forward to august  our ideal target candidate to work with in our program models tend to have some extensive challenges in their young lives in the mental health or social work field these are commonly referred to as ace is  adverse childhood experiences please do google it and take a minute to learn a little bit about it as it was said in a conference earlier this month at uni ace is changed my life and my perspective once i learned about it so it is time to unveil the official name that will sit over the hail mary project and several other programs in the cedar valley the robert j greenlee area collaborative for experiences aces otherwise known as greenlee ace is this is not a center or a club or anything like that it is more of an idealogy a vision a mission having said that we offer a very unique program model and set of services unlike anybody else and are able to do so because of extensive collaborations with area agencies such as juvenile courts waterloo police dept family amp children is council the university of northern iowa from its athletics teams to the social work department to the center for violence prevention and many more if you have paid any attention to local media in recent months there is been chatter about a newlycreated position within the police department to combat delinquency and gang violence using alternative means we are at a point where we need to raise upwards of  to bring this opportunity to life sooner rather than later but hoping for a significantly higher amount i ask all of our followers friends collaborators and those in any other category to share this post andor tag people connected with funding sources private individuals looking to truly make a difference be it businesses grant opportunities etc im more than willing to meet with as many people as i need to in order to ensure this is launched and if you are skeptic now i promise you will not be when we are done talking   so in closing since this is a lot of content to sift through if you tag people and i know you will or share this you can gtgtgt them to paragraphs  and  thanks in advance to all of you believers j,1

this weekend i knocked on my th door at every door and in every conversation ive asked our neighbors to share their thoughts on the opportunities and challenges we face here in denver below i lay out some of what ive heard across the district gun safety nearly everyone ive talked to has been energized by the march for our lives and inspired by the activism and leadership of our young people folks support new common sense approaches to gun safety that mean  s enforcing colorados existing background check laws and banning accessories like bump stocks which only exist to make weapons more lethal it also means developing a better understanding of what drives gun violence by funding research that gets at the heart of the problem access to healthcare for many the price of an insurance plan purchased through the colorado exchange has increased by  or more over the past two years people are concerned about having to pay such a large portion of their paycheck just to keep their health insurance and theyre worried about the consequences if the affordable care act is repealed thats why i believe colorado should allow anyone to buy into medicaid creating an affordable and stable health insurance market funding for public education ive also listened as parents and grandparents have expressed frustration that colorados public schools are nd in the country in funding per student children deserve to go to schools that can afford classroom supplies and extracurricular activities and colorados teachers deserve better pay affordable housing finally people who have lived in their homes for decades are worried about being priced out by rising rents and property taxes i hope to collaborate with residents local governments and builders to create affordable housing solutions that work for families young people and retiring seniors,1

the fact is that all of canada is bank raked in record profits this quarter while nearly  million canadians have lost some or all of their income
through creative accounting theyve reduced their reportable profit by holding the majority back from reporting as provisions for credit losses just in case for loans that may default or not
if those loans dont default that withheld amount turns back into profit for their shareholders
that is why shares in the companies have surged in recent days

"attention update press release of  what does aua have that thousands of entrepreneurs do not have please like and share if you would like to know or understand this
what does aua have that thousands of companies dont have aua renovation vs desperate calls for help from local small business owners christian huber innsbruck entrepreneur and chamber of commerce official asks uncomfortable questions to those responsible in the state
dear members of the federal government dear members of the national council dear decisionmakers in the most diverse functions and committees
i would like to address you with my open letter and thus state my fears my regret and my lack of understanding for some decisions made in the context of the corona crisis consciously as an individual consciously without partypolitical coloring consciously without any ideological approach just as the solidarity was announced at the beginning of the corona crisis i expect the elected representatives in the various committees to also close ranks in the urgently needed and overdue problem solving without partisan tactics and election campaign noise
it is not amusing to observe how the most diverse political representatives duel in their pools of ideas with proposed solutions for the best headline especially since some of the suggestions are more for the coveted likes on the facebook page than sustainable solutions does the abolition of the mns obligation mean that you really have more money in your pocket to spend or how should vouchers be distributed as widely as possible across the economy do wellknown addresses benefit the most from this it would be primarily a task for politicians and mandataries to pay less attention to headlines and more to content
the abolition of compensation under the epidemic law was a unanimous decision thus there is joint responsibility for further development through overly bureaucratic difficult to understand and nontransparent covid measures laws
the fact that some members of parliament are currently remembering the usefulness of the provisions of the epidemic act although they were in the economic interest of overriding the decisive provisions shows a certain ability to learn but it seems to come too late
the regulations of the epidemic act are generally known and quite understandable and sensible however the replacement regulations covid  measures are nontransparent incomprehensible in need of clarification and raise a large number of questions
let is take the example of aua in  austrian airlines recorded sales of around  billion euros this corresponds to an average monthly turnover without taking seasonal fluctuations into account and it wasnt the peak season ideally of eur  million according to the provisions of the epidemic act this turnover would correspond to support for three months midmarch to midjune with a very simple and extremely businessfriendly calculation of around  million euros assumption would be  euros turnover and all costs remain  exist instead there is currently talk of supporting the aua with an even higher sum put simply the aua would like more public money than it would ideally have spent in this period and also benefits from shorttime work layoffs and the fact that many costs kerosene takeoff and landing fees catering and lounge costs and much more are not incurred since there are no planes in the air especially from the point of view that the epidemic law for austrian companies was not implemented because the state cannot afford it i would like to ask you for an understandable and comprehensible explanation of this special circumstance
since you are informed about the current development in our country i will refrain from giving many negative examples and reports from the field of epus and smes which are opposed to the state support considerations of the aua alone the enumeration of the regulations such as partial assumption of fixed costs only from a  drop in sales with incomprehensible graduations or the company with subsidies as part of the hardship fund with minimum amounts of a maximum of  euros per month or public guarantee assumptions by the state for loans that the entrepreneur himself has to secure more than  of his own assets should be sufficient to prove this imbalance
i would also like to quote barbara stockl ombudswoman of the kronenzeitung from may th  no one will be saved this way and above all something must be wrong when so many feel abandoned to put it simply the austrian entrepreneurs who form the backbone of the domestic economy with their sole proprietorships or small businesses are being left to their fate by the austrian state despite announcements in the media cost what it may
may i ask you for an understandable and comprehensible explanation for the fate of the thousands affected
you all have a responsibility for the country with your office you have decided to work actively to be creative and to work for austria and its people in the best sense of the word i dont expect any excuses from you no political back and forth no but the others i expect simple and clear answers from you i expect equal treatment for all entrepreneurs and your full commitment to solving this dramatic situation

autism amp ethnicity aims to educate the public about the impact of race and culture on our autistic identities the committee published the anthology all the weight of our dreams on living racialized autism in addition the committee runs a grant program for autistic people of color divergent when disability amp feminism collide is an initiative of awn network which seeks to explore the impact of sexism and ableism in disabled and nondisabled communities divergent is run exclusively by disabled people of varying identities and disabilities the committee plans to host a symposium and publish an anthology of discussions from the one day conference awn network has an ongoing health provider survey with a linked database listing intimate care providers these providers offer sensory friendly and accessible health care in our work to develop more inclusive and accessible communities and opportunities awn network focuses on challenging societal attitudes about the worth of disabled lives autistic women amp nonbinary network welcomes all women both transgender and cisgender nonbinary and genderqueer people twospirit people people who have at any time identified as women or girls and all other people of marginalized genders or of no gender awn recognizes and affirms all peoples gender identities and expressions as well as choices about disclosure transition and going stealth awn networks major accomplishments include  two publications  the girls anthology is a compilation of twenty  essays by autistic people to communicate to parents of autistic girls what their daughters are going through during various stages of their growth and maturity what every autistic girl wishes her parents knew is the book that many adults on the autistic spectrum wish their parents would have had access to when they were growing up in this first girls anthology book release from awn network the autistic contributors write with honesty and generosity about the emotional needs sensitivity and vibrancy of autistic girls containing thoughtful and practical encouragement and support for parents and compiled from the acquired wisdom and experience of autistic individuals parents are finding this collection of essays an invaluable resource for supporting their autistic daughters in developing strength trust and confidence in themselves and in the world  all the weight of our dreams on living racialized autism is a collection of essays poetry fiction and art from over fifty  autistics of color on the experience of living in a world being autistic and nonwhite an excerpt from their webpage describes the anthology project in this way for those of us who are autistic and racialized we often struggle to find representation in mass media academic work about autism or race and the activist and advocacy movements that focus on autism neurodiversity disability rights or racial justice most autism and autistic organizations publications about autism and broader neurodiversity campaigns are predominantly white yet disabled black and brown students are most likely to be impacted by the school to prison pipeline the vast majority of us prisoners are disabled and black or brown racialized people are a global majority which means that autistic people of color far outnumber white autistic people in the world and the combined impact of race and disability severely increase likelihood for hate crimes police violence all other forms of abuse and repeated retraumatization our stories matter and must be told we hope that this collection will not only speak sharply against our constant erasure and invisibility as at least doubly impacted but will also provide solace and familiarity for our own out there waiting for stories like theirs to be told  the first of its kind health care survey and resource list this database lists gynecologists and other intimate care providers who offer accessible and sensoryconsiderate health care to women and

of ventura county is facing prohibitive and dangerous regulations  the ventura county wildlife corridor and its impact  more than public lands in january  in a  vote the ventura county board of supervisors advised the planning division to study potential new restrictions and regulations covering  acres approximately  of ventura county this includes  acres of both public and private property that cuts through the heart of ventura county nam  ing it the habitat connectivity and wildlife movement corridors then in august of  the county of ventura proposed to add additional restrictions and regulations what ventura county residents need to know is that the county board of supervisors is moving fast they are pushing to implement the wildlife corridor zoning ordinance and its related land use restrictions and regulations in march of  new regulations and restrictions will devastate local families and farms and restrict public use the ventura county supervisors plan to create a habitat connectivity wildlife corridor overlay zone which imposes a myriad of new regulations and restrictions for landowners within that zone they would identify additional overlay areas and title them critical wildlife passage areas that includes even more restrictions essentially ventura county properties could be subject to  sets of zoning regulations  the base set of zoning regulations depending on category for example residential commercial rural agricultural  the habitat connectivity and wildlife movement corridor zone  the critical wildlife passage areas the impact of this on landowners and the community will be devastating the new restrictions and regulations on both public and private property encompass  fencing installation or replacement  lighting installation or replacement including removal of existing lighting no longer permitted under the conditions of the new ordinance other lighting restrictions will be enforced including height direction color and hours  eliminating nonnative invasive plants  restricting vegetation removal including fire prevention and mitigation measures  designation of wildlife passage areas across farmland with no scientific studies  building of new structures and fencing on properties in the wildlife passage areas would require environmental analysis or setting aside half of the land to revert to its natural state for wildlife habitat  awarding the planning director the discretionary power to control and even deny every aspect of basic property improvements that are not specifically exempt from the ordinance  requiring land owners to undergo a full environmental analysis of projects including houses barns lighting and fences before approval  expanding the size of surface water area buffer zones rendering many properties virtually unusable  conditional use permits will be in jeopardy of nonrenewal once they expire  preventing land owners from making improvements or rebuilding property like fencing barns and homes if damaged by fire or other natural disasters threat of increased wildfires impacts public safety new restrictive regulations preventing landowners from conducting fire prevention measures will increase the already dangerous threat of devastating wildfires for reference the thomas hill and woolsey fires scorched over  acres and burned over  structures the recent fires destroyed wildlife populations and their habitat the national park service estimates that the santa monica mountains lost half of its habitat in the fire burning  acres or  percent of the areas federal parkland wildlife critical passage areas  vague regulations the lack of clarity in these regulations would result in projects from simply installing fencing to planting crops in the county be subject to the discretion of the county planning director wildlife already travels through many areas of ventura county it is important to note that the original wildlife corridor zoning proposal was designed to maintain existing wildlife passage points not to create new ones no compensation to land owners essentially the wildlife corridor ordinance is a conservation easement with no compensation to land owners it does not provide any allowances for the individual needs of families who own and pay taxes on ventura county properties out of date data is being utilized many of the recommendations for the wildlife corridor are based off of studies and models conducted over  years ago as an example there is a corridor indicated on the new zoning map that fully encompasses the bell canyon subdivision landowners to bear the expense of out of date maps a surface water overlay map has been created showing how  foot buffer zones overlay properties within the wildlife corridor in ventura county however the map includes manmade features for example ponds and swimming pools that were purposely excluded in the ordinance language from new wildlife buffer zones landowners will have to pay county planners and consultant biologists to remove unintended restrictions on their land your voices need to be heard  attend the board of supervisors meeting if you are concerned about this proposed wildlife

the spirit of the age part  like many of us people are searching for answers for the problems we face as a nation for us to find solutions we have to move beyond the myopic internalized views we often use and attempt to gain new perspective through the renewing of our minds in the light gods truths in general i am not one to promote conspiracy theories although i do believe there is a spiritual darkness of this generation working against us that we have to constantl  y be aware of and that we have an adversary that works through anyone who is willing to submit to his influence his tools of deception and lies are just a few of the ensnarements that often blind us from seeing clearly and then reacting in a way that has no benefit for us as a people such is the case in the killing of george floyd and the following civil unrest regardless of who he was as a person or what crimes he committed his life was taken from him without sufficient cause or the due process that was his right that much is obvious to everyone and it is not his death that has impacted the world he is not a hero or martyr he is a victim and the motivation was not primarily race related racism is the distraction the person who changed the world is ex officer derick chauvin and his brutal disregard for a human life with the hate that drove him to this heinous act even though he knew he was being filmed so if racism is not the cause then what is economics it is the haves verses the have nots racism is just the cover to keep our focus away from the real agenda of social engineering by the leftwing elitist entrenched in our government mostly from the democratic party the quarantine was also just the cover they used they do not care about social reform but rather societal control through advancing the socialist agenda it could not have been more deliberately orchestrated but through willing participants unaware of their complicity by unknowingly submitting to the spiritual darkness unleashed by the antichrist spirit of the age and by the removal of the one who restrains nd thes  what concerns me at the moment is our response as a society and the negative outpouring of emotional charged behavior we are witnessing as people search for resolution to the perceived racism we are experiencing from this travesty and how quickly elements of our government are monopolizing on the situation to our harm just look at where the focus has been defunding the police redistribution of wealth reparations free everything for your vote destruction of property looting rioting mail in voting government handouts and the reinterpretation of established truth these are all economic issues and for what and why is there such an intensity right now on a global scale it is about the timing of a plan that has been in the works for generations to bankrupt the united states and destroy the constitution that gave us our freedoms if we continue to submit to government handouts they will eventually gain unrestricted control over us because the debtor is subject to the lender when we as a people react with violent protest and rioting we empower the government against us believe me when i say that there are elements of government that gauges the amount of social engineering they can use against us that the spiritual conspiracy emanates from the darkness that is the antichrist spirit at work designed to keep mankind in bondage through the governments of men racism is a real problem but it is not the preeminent threat of our day its merely the distraction to the real threat of globalism there are elitist leaders throughout the nations that have thoughtfully and deliberately worked to put us under their control to stop the advancement of gods kingdom of righteousness right living the current administration is fighting against globalist policies president trump was not part of their plan he is the disruptor of their plan which is why there is an extreme effort to remove him from the office of the presidency so they can continue on their path of putting us under socialist and eventually communist control what we are seeing is the ensuing warfare as principalities powers and rulers of darkness of this world work through the spiritual wickedness of men to enslave us and send us back to the government control of egyptian slavery this type of bondage is not based on race but as i said before economic control that is what is at risk here that we lose the freedoms we have because we did not discern the season and identify the enemy properly because we got caught up in our own issues and failed to love our neighbor love covers a multitude of sin that is what we can all do on a personal level we can choose to love and forgive and not give our adversary the opportunity to put us in bondage because we could not rule ourselves wisely this is what james had to say about it james   from whence come wars and fightings among you come they not hence even of your lusts that war in your members  ye lust and have not ye kill and desire to have and cannot obtain ye fight and war yet ye have not because ye ask not ye ask and receive not because ye ask amiss that ye may consume it upon your lusts  ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with god whoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of god  do ye think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to envy  but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith god resisteth the proud but giveth grace to the humble  submit yourselves therefore to god resist the demon and he will flee from you  draw nigh to god and he will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands ye sinners and purify your hearts ye double minded  be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness  humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up  speak not evil one of another brethren he that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth his brother speaketh evil of the law and judgeth the law but if thou judge the law thou art not a doer of the law but a judge  there is one lawgiver who is able to save and to destroy who art thou that judgest another now all of this is driven by a spirit of greed from the elitist but for us it is a spirit of covetousness these two elements work together to put us in servitude to the government in closing in recent memory we should all look to the example of martin luther king jr the government cannot stop the peaceful protest and advancement that was won through the civil rights movement but they will use this to take away our rights if we let them and it will be our own fault if they do blessings madson,1

seeing with new eyes it may be difficult to accept that just maybe all people really do have an equal worth that must be taken seriously and that perhaps it is not inevitable that we will always give in to our anger hatred biases and prejudices instead perhaps we can find a new living spirit with a true reverence for our shared humanity to really find such reverence however we must look through the haze of our own intolerance and judgment and begin to look at  each other with new eyes eyes of compassion and generosity that dont overlook the concrete reality of all of our lives we are all real people we all share a common humanity we all feel joy and love we all suffer and there are so many unbreakable threads that bind all of us together with all of life to deny these facts is to deny reality itself this is an ultimate form of realism  to take a moment to look and see the radiance that shines at the core of all life beyond our prejudices fears and judgments in the end our deepest values are rooted in our ability to make the choice to appreciate and indeed have reverence for and then to protect and nurture how we all are connected together in obvious and subtle ways one to another excerpted from the unpublished manuscript in the light of our shared humanity the power of seeing one another and the hope of a quietly emerging spiritual humanism,1

nine years ago today the united states senate voted to confirm justice sonia sotomayor as the first latina to serve on the us supreme court and on this day years ago president johnson signed the voting rights act into law  which expanded the promise of universal suffrage by dismantling some of the systems that kept minority voters from casting a ballot that both should fall on the same date is fitting as justice sotomayor has been an avid defender of the vra on the  supreme court  forcefully dissenting from recent decisions that have seen the slow and steady erosion of the promises made and protections put in place by the vra one of the fondest memories i have of my time working for president barack obama  came just after justice sotomayor returned to the white house having just been confirmed by the senate i was part of the team that worked on her confirmation  i had been tasked with helping to mobilize support for her confirmation from outside advocacy organizations and after the successful vote to confirm her to the court we held a little celebration in the white house i vividly remember justice sotomayor thanking me and giving me a big hug it was such a joyful warm and genuine moment justice sotomayors work on the court has made us all very proud  as the president knew it would and she has been a forceful defender of voting rights and the voting rights act her steadfast defense of voting rights was prominently on display this past june in abbott vs perez  where the court decided to uphold texas gerrymandered districts this was despite the fact that a lower court had previously found that the districts had been intentionally drawn to discriminate against latinx voters the words of her dissenting opinion are a clarion call to action in defense of voting rights the court today goes out of its way to permit the state of texas to use maps that the threejudge district court unanimously found were adopted for the purpose of preserving the racial discrimination that tainted its previous maps this disregard of both precedent and fact comes at serious costs to our democracy it means that after years of litigation and undeniable proof of intentional discrimination minority voters in texasdespite constituting a majority of the population within the statewill continue to be underrepresented in the political process those voters must return to the polls in  and  with the knowledge that their ability to exercise meaningfully their right to vote has been burdened by the manipulation of district lines specifically designed to target their communities and minimize their political will the fundamental right to vote is too precious to be disregarded in this manner i dissent,1

"a new city hall during the covid crisis
the  capital budget was recently presented to the current mandeville city council the repercussions of approving this budget at this time could have long lasting effects on the city citizens need to be aware of the situation
the capital budget contains a couple of projects that could best be defined as wants not needs and should be given serious review prior to approval one of the wants is a new city hall and the other is a berm bike path project that would connect lakeshore drive to sunset point these projects may be worthy things to look at down the road however we need to be focused first on our needs given the current situation and uncertainties especially in the next few months
we should monitor our revenues over the next  months to analyze our financial condition before moving forward with any expensive capital projects many predictions from federal and state authorities such as louisiana legislative auditor is report predict local governments revenues will be down mainly in the area of sales tax collections it is unknown how hard this will affect mandeville however we should assess the situation before spending on big capital budget items that might be wants
in a related matter there is a budget adjustment on this current agenda to revise the bermbikepath project at sunset point to be funded  from the city of mandeville is budget it is currently slated to be funded with  coming from the city is budget and  from a matching grant i oppose this budget adjustment at this time
i would like to hear from you on these budget issues please feel to call or email me at anytime thank you",1

the forward edge of history the vision of america that came to life with the birth of the nation was historic that vision controversial as it then was has been subverted today by a bitter divisiveness that disallows dialog and obstructs decisionmaking our efforts to regain the integrity of our national identity and to build a future we can believe in will call on americans to navigate through currents of alienation hostility and misinformation violence begets violence in a downward spiral verbal or otherwise words can ignite uncontrollable fires and dishonest or selfserving actions can do the same destructiveness can take many forms arguably the united states has been headed for trouble for decades but in the last quarter century social and economic conditions have reached dysfunctional extremes of miscommunication irresponsibility and violence when the banking system nearly collapsed in  the united states hovered on the edge of material catastrophe americans discovered that failures of responsibility foresight and common sense involved the very people and institutions we depended on we were stunned by the foolishness that came to light in places where we are most vulnerable it was a startling discovery a cavalier disregard for the interests of both citizens and nation by institutions we had previously regarded as models of dependability in retrospect however we can see that the crisis had been a long time coming  that it continues today that nothing has been fixed and that it reveals far more than foolishness the disarray is surely the consequence of something deeper and more basic than financial incompetence national leadership has stained itself confidence was compromised trust destroyed first in politics then among institutions and interests that have associated too closely with politics we have seen immoral and deeply hurtful actions committed by religious leaders and clergy the supposed exemplars of integrity where will it stop in addition to the material damage done to our lives the rampant failure of responsibility appearing at the core of our society is degrading and demoralizing there is nothing more destructive than distrust indeed it strikes at the foundations of civilization times of peril require that we avoid contributing to inflamed passions however offended we may be hurled accusations and insults make it impossible for others to listen and hear reason the trouble with blame is first that it tends to be indiscriminate it blinds us to the complexity of circumstances and to the plural identities of those who disagree with us  or who may have just made some very bad mistakes we often fail to see that we share certain values and commitments with those who anger us secondly blaming blinds us to looming perils that are the fault of no one a fierce storm has come upon us we need each other for the sake of our local communities a storm of this magnitude will alter everyones perspective the time is coming when we will need to reassess to adjust and to seek safety in collaboration we must resist fear and its passions and learn to work with those around us we will build from there some of you have expressed serious doubts that this is possible i never said it would be easy i said we have no choice if we are unable to confront crises shouldertoshoulder as loyal americans freedom will be lost in the chaos of the deepening storm this will require patience and learned skills we must try to see the end in the beginning  the vision of a renewed society where respectfulness fairness and moral responsibility prevail both individual freedom and community coherence depend on this it is a purpose that might just be worth our learning to get along even for the most doubtful among us local communities are the one place where we can be assured of having the freedom and ability to make this happen steadfast determination and the american generosity of spirit are among the virtues that will be called upon again and again in the coming days the future will inflict tests upon us whether or not we respond with dignity and compassion  whether or not we take our rightful place at the forward edge of history tom a note to readers please watch for the next post on or about december  new readers can find a project description a draft introduction to the coming book and drafts of several early chapters at the primary blog site wwwfreedomstruthnet,1

"a year in parliament the intention was to achieve  percent in the province of antwerp exactly one year ago impossible carl devos said on television and some cackled after him we went on and what did we do we clocked in at  percent across the province and we went from  to  elected representatives in the federal parliament from  to  elected representatives in the flemish parliament we got our first european elected representatives and another  in the walloon parliament and  in the brussels parliament bam from  to  supralocal mandate holders a year ago
today i am surrounded in parliament i am surrounded by more than a century of trade union experience that is only possible with our group with gaby colebunders former union representative of ford genk do you remember his first intervention a fiery indictment against racism when the asylum center of bilzen was set on fire by farright pyromaniacs for thirty years the miners have been asking for their pension to be rectified it is only when miner is son gaby colebunders enters parliament that things finally get going chance maybe what is certain is that gaby will sink his teeth into it until it is arranged and that the liberal ministers are crazy about colere a large lobby group of the miners that is what they call gaby and co that is a nice compliment the pvda as a more efficient megaphone of the working class
also think of maria vindevoghel for twenty years she has been cleaning the airport of brussels in the cleaning would she have known then that she is shaking up parliamentarians from the stands today about the future of the airport madam minister i have experienced it myself says maria with roberto damico after  years of night shift at caterpillar in gosselies to parliament with nadia moscufo  years of service at aldi the fiery trade union woman from liege gaby maria roberto nadia working class heroes in parliament
street council street that is our starting point we listen to what is going on in the workplace and in the neighbourhood we will bring this to parliament substantiated with proposals from our research department and staff and afterwards we bring it back to the workplace and the neighbourhood we have a wonderful team of dozens of employees who study who contact the unions or professors or civil society who are looking for testimonials who prepare the interventions in parliament who record subtitle publish the videos those who are on site do research and listen most importantly listen my deepest respect for all those teams in the federal european flemish walloon and brussels parliament and in the senate no routines no cabinet members no springboard careerists but all new people with a big social heart much respect to all those companeras y companeros and thumbs up also to raoul hedebouw pvda nadia moscufo ruben ramboer marco van hees gille feyaerts and loonis logghe who lead the entire group
best moment of the past year our emergency fund for healthcare we have worked hard for that populism the liberals and nva shouted in unison any miscreant can get any crazy proposal through parliament said servais verherstraeten cdv about our health care fund insane proposal and about me miscreant but we continued and the  million euros extra for healthcare came the telephone from a hospital in early april that the money from our fund had arrived made me shed a tear our change is working
say do you really think that all those people forgot about that right away or what when sofie merckx gets angry she speaks antwerp she has been living in charleroi for years and is a gp there for medicine for het volk perfectly bilingual such as raoul hedebouw pvda from liege and thierry warmoes from namur sofie was able to put her stamp on barely a year she has helped to ensure that patient associations have a place and an advisory voice on the pharmaceutical reimbursement committee during the corona crisis she makes the voice of medicine voor het volk heard in a debate that is colored by  different ministers of mouth masks and even more ministers responsible for public health today sophie is fighting to have covid recognized as an occupational disease an important bill that may be able to pass sophie makes no distinction brussels resident fleming or waal they all count for us that we are one national party the red devils of politics it still makes all other factions uncomfortable
we have a very diverse group there is raoul hedebouw pvda he is incomparable passionate committed strong he is the engine of the team there are the calm interventions of greet daems equally involved substantiated convincing you should do it anyway as a newcomer to that macho parliament you have the passion of nabil boukili when he defends the palestinians in the foreign policy debates and the tranquility of steven de vuyst who sits next to me in that parliament steven is alderman of the pvda in zelzate on the ghentterneuzen canal together with borgerhout this is the reddest spot in the north of the country steven is on the social affairs committee on december  he and raoul hedebouw submitted the country is first civil law act to the chamber of representatives the request to increase the minimum pension in our country to  euros net in the meantime we had collected more than  signatures with the entire party in the meantime we are five months after the submission and parliament continues to use all possible tricks to avoid discussing our proposal
we have been active in the federal parliament for a year now the classical parties accuse us of populism because we dare to propose that mps would give half a month is wages for the fight against corona this is done in dozens of countries with us all classical parties arrogantly sweep such a proposal off the table last week things were once again up in the air when we proposed to introduce a corona tax on multimillionaires to pay the bill for the crisis one economist after another in europe meanwhile is convinced that it is high time to make the very rich contribute instead of allowing wealth inequality to grow into a frenzied chasm but with us the traditional parties have become so arrogant that they dont want to see or hear real political innovation people no longer like that our proposals do according to the latest polls we would keep all our voters from last year and add another half of new voters we will see
one thing is certain we will continue you force change throughout society parliamentary work is just a megaphone of what is happening on the ground a megaphone for the working class a megaphone for honest politics a megaphone for change i promised that exactly one year ago we do our best with all our base groups with all our members and employees in the neighborhoods and in the workplace as dirk van duppen put it the pvda with extraordinary people who are ordinary and with ordinary people who are extraordinary with light workers and with shadow workers i see the world tipping i believe it will be okay",1

meet you in the middle healing divisions while facing enemies at home and abroad by shay mcneal this morning definitely feels different from the moment i saw the video of mr floyd pleading for his life and the officer whose name i do not even want to type willfully ignoring his and others call to recognize that he had a human beneath his knee who was in grave jeopardy i knew just people would not tolerate this action as floyds ability to bring precious life forth from his body was ebbing he called for his mother and he was ignored what kind of animal keeps his hand in his pocket and passively rejects the cries from a man he purportedly had worked with when both men had been hired to provide security at a local nightclub in minnesota one can only question had their paths crossed in some testosteronecharged manner while policing the nightlife in clubs where they were expected to be manly as they were there to remind folks ill boot you out if you dont behave i can only in desperation wonder if there is a back story that somehow would even begin to explain how dismissive and unconnected this officer appears as mr floyd gasps for air and pleads for his mother did this go tragically wrong as the officer thought it was not really serious i am just searching for any i repeat any feasible explanation that one human can do to another what happened to mr floyd how did such nonchalant disregard well up in one man against another is race the answer in this case was it causative if not the outcome has spawned and wholly ignited a racedriven atmosphere that has far reaching consequences both here and abroad for the sake of all humanity we need to take a hard look at what is lying just under the skin regardless of what color ones skin is that allows these horrific events to unfold we keep hearing how police are motivated by race when arresting african americans indeed there are those who had a racedriven mentality baked into their souls i have been privileged to work with law enforcement and know that the vast majority of police ranks would not even comprehend doing such a thing to a person just because they happened to be a person of color as what was perpetrated on mr floyd i also know these people  yes countless people who are protecting us are colorblind  regardless of their age or background on the other hand the action against mr floyd is seen too much are those who are driven by systemically racist feelings just waiting for an opportunity of a traffic stop a nonviolent warrant or a warrant that is issued in a criminal case to find a reason to harm maim and sometimes kill the object of their hatred george floyd was accused of passing counterfeit money and apparently surrendered to the police why did this escalate can we root out vile hateful people from our policing ranks so people of color in this country can breathe freely without fear that some sort of justice will be taken before they have a real day in court to determine if they have violated the laws of this nation moreover there are those who have been wrongly aggressed and have no reason to be stopped just because they are a person of color cant we find a way for a telephone call to be sent directly to an internal watchdog committee that steps in to stop the escalation immediately sure some would take advantage of that avenue but is it not worth it to stop escalations during these turbulent encounters there must be a way for the laws and actions taken by officers to be applied equally we cannot give up our civilization to these moments if this is not the breaking point we may not be far from the breaking point that will destabilize our nation in the most profound way lets look at the last few months an attack was leveled squarely at this country and its name was covid one of the most aggressive enemies we have faced in the last  years during the spanish flu epidemic that lasted for two years we also had race riots affecting the lives and economy of this country it also is taking a disproportionate amount of people of color it is now in danger of surging again the closeness of the crowds forming in many of our cities and not social distancing may lead to more deaths how fair is that to all folks especially when the majority of the crowds are people of color not much changes in history if we do not fix or at least attempt to resolve the issues that have repeatedly led to unrest we are going to relive them but this time it is distinctly different in the past information did not run at the speed of light and foreign adversaries could not so handedly distribute their take now they are bent on distorting our challenge to their advantage how many people of color reside in china or russia look it up you will be astounded as they tell us what to do believe me they do not have any moral superiority today the chinese governments position was that pelosi and pompeo should now understand that we are as guilty as they are in their opposition to the demonstrators in hong kong pardon me and i may get some blow back from what i am about to say but i do not and will not buy this as being in any way the same kind of demonstrator hong kong was handed back to china in  with signed agreements to last for  years that the citizens of hong kong were to retain selfgovernance they had enjoyed under british rule this past week after covid which started in china and quieted their demonstrations for several months the chinese communist party is coming down hard if you are outside of the party mandates you are dragged out of your home in the middle of the night and often your family is as well depending on who you are you may just disappear i defy any american to prove that our government has taken this kind of action against our citizens black or white as a stated position of the american government please find for me one government mandated reeducation camp like millions of uighurs have been pressed to inhabit they are being forced to leave behind their homes their religions and their culture as they are being told they will remain in custody until they conform just because of the accident of birth they will never be able to live freely even after being reeducated our race relations have a troubled history and must be addressed but not in a political fashion the political divide is at a fever pitch and has been growing for decades in september  in my column which was titled whos dealing the truth as pols play the race card i wrote race has been a difficult issue in this country honest dialogue has been nearly impossible to cultivate as there is a deep well of emotions that can spew its rancid water anytime the discussions become inflamed there is no doubt we should have engaged in more honest discussions long ago but i fear the struggle to have those discussions as we attempt to meet in the middle will now be influenced by bad players nation states that pay for and fuel agitators here are very sophisticated their purpose is to seize the issue that has divided us and divide us enough to destroy our nation as history has shown they have been successful at before now china and russia were reformulated in just this way i know we are smarter than that  lets seize the moment and work hard with honesty and pure motivation fueled by respect for each other as we demonstrate how a true democracy works for all then those whose propaganda seeks to distort what moral superiority actually looks like will have been reeducated,1

in slow motion i can see whats happening to my family but i cant stop it last week when i couldnt even afford a birthday gift for my little girl that right there was my lowest point i know i have to do something but what growing up my parents taught me to be a fighter never quit you get knocked down get right back up but what if youre stuck dont know what to do and scared youll lose everything my wife and i have shared what were going through with friends weve spent hours googling for answers we mustve read twenty articles on how to get out of debt but how do we know whats right for us everyone seems to have a different answer how can they all be right if it sounds like im venting i am dont get me wrong im not giving up i want to do the right thing ive always paid off my debts but what am i supposed to do when i can barely afford to put food on the table im falling behind on payments and collectors are calling i desperately want to pay down debts but it feels impossible at this point tell me what i can do to get out this mess and ill do it please dont sugarcoat it im hoping bankruptcy is not my only option the only thing i know for sure is that i cant wait any longer i wont let this take me and my family down please help me thank you in advance dave  i shared daves story because it reminded me of my own it was  my wife and i were fighting to hold on to our business things were going from bad to worse we took out loans so we could keep paying our employees i stopped taking home a paycheck i couldnt get myself to accept what was happening we were drowning in debt sharks were circling it was our first year of marriage our first child was on the way we couldnt even afford the house we were renting hearing my wife say we have to move in with my parents hit me hard i was grateful but i was definitely feeling discouraged and defeated it was all i could do to keep fighting and fighting believing i could somehow turn things around but you know what its hard to see a glimmer of hope when the sharks are coming after you then one night something happened that woke me up it wasnt anything my wife said it wasnt another billor even another call from a collectorit was our little girl on the wayshes the one who woke me up as my wifes due date got closer and closer the thought of not having a home for our baby girl changed something inside of me and it happened almost overnighti suddenly had someone so precious to fight for that i would do anything to take care of my baby and her mommy it was the extra push i needed it was the why that changed everything just at the right time and it put a whole new level of fight and determination in me this year that little girl just celebrated her th birthday and she still inspires me every day shes totally amazingsweetcreative and full of love the best big sister in the world along with her mom her brothers and her little sister they are the why that fuels my tank every single day looking back ill always be grateful for that time in my life it was hard but a blessing from god i learned so many lessons the hard way lessons about managing money running a business and how to get out of highinterest debt so it doesnt take over your life and steal your familys future most importantly i learned that if your why means enough to you youll discover the strength the faith and the determination to move any mountain in your life today i am cofounder of a company called californiarelieforg and it feels good to share my story with people all over california who are overwhelmed

im grateful to robert f kennedy jr jenny mccarthy mark blaxill dr paul thomas dr chris exley and jennifer margulis phd all of whom have provided reviews of my book included below the book remains at  in the autismasperger is category because of the choice of so many of you to preorder the book which will be released on september th thank you for your support and if you have not preordered i hope you consider doing so jb handley is arguably the  worlds most thoughtful sophisticated knowledgeable and indefatigable activist for childrens health and safety as a frontline leader for fifteen years handley has led the big fistfight against the pharma cartel to force the issue broadcast the science and expose the lies behind the vaccine policies that have created an epidemic of chronic disease among our children handley has helped bring the issue of toxins in medical products and regulatory corruption to a tipping point handleys advocacy has lifted the curtain of lies behind which the autism epidemic has sprouted when we end this cataclysm it will be thanks to the dogged character of people like jb handley who have refused to rest in his battle to support parents protect children bring justice to injured families and to punish those responsible for one of the worst scandals in american history please read this book and decide for yourself if you still believe that vaccines are safe and effective robert f kennedy jr i honestly believe jb handley wrote the book that will end the autism epidemic as i sit here now in stillness i want to jump up and down with excitement but im holding back rivers of tears he breaks down the scientific information in a way that doesnt intimidate the reader and he lets us know its okay to be angry his soul his fight his love for his son radiates off the pages wow bravo bravo jenny mccarthy author of louder than words coauthor of healing and preventing autism this book is inspired powerful the unadulterated truth and a must read we have sacrificed too many children at the vaccine altar while our blind belief in the cdc and aap government and the media has prevented us from seeing the conflicts of interest that enable big business and big pharma to profit at the expense of our childrens health how to end the autism epidemic is one familys story but it is sadly also a story shared by millions of families a beautiful normal baby vaccinated and then lost to autism and all the horrible medical conditions associated with immune devastation and brain toxicity thank you jb for sharing your story and wisdom parents and future parents read this book now and say no to business as usual and the status quo if your pediatrician has not yet done his or her own research and is just parroting the vaccines are safe and effective marketing phrase it is time for you to get a new pediatrician paul thomas md coauthor of the vaccinefriendly plan and the addiction spectrum as parents our job is to be concerned about our childrens health yet every day in doctors offices around the country american parents are told we are being irresponsible or selfish just for asking questions about vaccines we all want to keep our children safe and healthy both from infectious diseases and from overexposure to toxins its reasonable to be concerned that there are too many vaccines on the schedule and that medications like antibiotics acetaminophen and adhd drugs are being overprescribed whats a worried parent to do for starters read this book sharing his personal story as the father of a boy with autism and taking a close look at the most recent and rigorous science stanfordeducated jb handley shows how the cdcs aggressive childhood vaccine schedule is connected to the astonishing rise in autism in the united states how to end the autism epidemic is a direct challenge to the american public health establishment and a gift to the millions of parents who find themselves caught in the crosshairsuncertain of what to think or doof the seemingly intractable debate about vaccines jennifer margulis phd author of your baby your way coauthor of the vaccinefriendly plan i have been thinking about the toxicity of aluminum for thirtyfive years it is my lifes work before we completed our recent research on aluminum in brain tissue in autism i could not see a direct link between human exposure to aluminum and autism i certainly saw no immediate role for aluminum adjuvants in vaccines in autism the missing link was a mechanism whereby the brain would be subjected to an acute exposure to aluminum for example as occurs in aluminuminduced dialysis encephalopathy proinflammatory cells some originating from blood and lymph heavily loaded with a cargo of aluminum in brain tissue in autism provided that missing link we all tolerate the toxicity of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines unfortunately some of us are predisposed to suffer as opposed to tolerate the toxicity of aluminum adjuvants and this may cause autism autism is a disease and it is not inevitable jb handleys elegant synthesis of what we know and what we need to know argues that autism could and should be preventable i agree with him professor christopher exley phd fellow royal society of biology professor of bioinorganic chemistry keele university jb handley tells it like it is his new book is a masterful synthesis of all the latest threads of autism the controversies the science the legal and policy battles and the human dimension of the movement that has inspired so many of us to become parent activists peppered with jawdropping new developmentsincluding depositions from major vaccine science luminarieshandley weaves a compelling narrative and cuts through the noise to make a powerful and convincing case read it

fifteen years ago i was addicted to opioids i had wrecked my back from various jobs the most likely culprit being as a cowboyactor at frontier town i saw one doctor after another trying to find a solution to my pain multiple doctors told me that surgery wouldnt do anything for me and that i just needed to manage the pain so i got a pain management doctor he prescribed hydrocodone telling me i could take as much as i wanted he said it wasnt addictive and yet i be  came addicted i kept taking more and more to control my pain after about six months of taking eight to nine pills a day i suddenly started prepping for the apocalypse my wife told me i was paranoid she looked up the symptoms of opioid abuse paranoia was one of the first ones listed like most addicts i told her i could quit anytime i wanted i quit cold turkey i thought i was going to die as i went through the opioid withdrawal i was lucky that i had a massive amount of support  from my family my friends and my workplace i never wanted to be addicted it wasnt a choice i was literally following doctors orders since this experience ive spent a lot of time researching initiatives both in this country and abroad i have talked to people who have opioid addictions or are in recovery mental health professionals public health officials elected officials and anyone that would talk to me about this issue these discussions and my own personal experiences have made me realize that there is no one simple solution we need a multifaceted approach to this public health crisis we need to take aggressive measures to combat this crisis the proposals that i bring forward are common sense bipartisan evidencebased ways to tackle this problem  fentanyl test strips  fentanyl is killing people every day fentanyl is the chief culprit in marylands dramatic increase in overdose deaths if we provide this inexpensive tool to atrisk populations we can at least ensure that the user is aware of the increased potential danger of the drug  legalize cannabis  studies have shown a correlation between having legal access to cannabis and lower opioid usage ratesas a comparatively safe alternative to opiates legalization would save taxpayers money by eliminating the costs of enforcement and incarceration for cannabis use and possession  needle exchange programs  taking this step will dramatically lower hiv transmission rates while also saving our health system money in the long run  increasing mental health providers  this would pay dividends to our society at large reducing crime lowering suicide rates lowering selfmedication and in the end lowering opioid use we need to expand access to services such as instituting the talbot county imbedded school therapist program statewide while also increasing incentives for individuals to enter the field such as covering student loans  remove the stigma surrounding mental health and addiction  people love awareness campaigns although they dont always do much help solve problems they do help make cracks in the stigma surrounding illness as portugal has shown when the stigma is removed from addiction the likelihood of people seeking treatment massively increases  decriminalize drug use  we want people to seek help not get used to lying to people about their behavior we have tried the war on drugsit failed decades after the war was declared we have an epidemic that kills more people per year than car accidents or aids ever did as the experiment in portugal has shown decriminalization drastically increases people seeking treatment without increasing opioid use this would not only be a costfree proposal to implement the reduced cost of lower incarceration rates can be redirected to provide treatment to those suffering from substance use disorders  give housing to the chronic homeless  as the city of salisbury program has shown this reduces costs for the city as it would statewide it is easier to get people into treatment if they have a stable address  increase public transportationaccess to addiction treatment and mental health providers  this should include utilizing new technologies like facetimeskype therapy as health officials in caroline county are already doing and even organizing rideshare programs on a county or state level if a program existed i believe this could be staffed with volunteers and possibly this can be done via a rideshare app developed by the state lack of access is a huge problem in rural communities  letters to doctors  this is tough as i know the doctor that prescribed me opioids was only trying to do one thing help me he was a good person who was trying to help me to not be in pain in my experience thats why doctors become doctors because they want to help people and heal people however there is research that shows if doctors receive letters informing them that their patients to whom they have prescribed opioids have died from an overdose they will prescribe less going forward  education for children and adults  if parents have opioids in their medicine cabinet those medications are not secure we want to believe that our children will not try opioids but we know they might remove the temptation and access perhaps most importantly talk to your kids about the danger of opioid use by the time you are done reading this another american will have died of an overdose we are losing our children we are losing our siblings we are losing our fathers our mothers our friends our artists our teachers our veterans but we are not helpless and we are certainly not hopeless we can learn from what others have done and take action to tackle this crisis however we cannot expect things to get better by just talking about it or just wearing purple awareness campaigns are important but they are not a solution we need real action now if you are currently using opioids there are resources to help consider reaching out to samhsa hotline help,1

carbon calculator looks at a product listing and attempts to match the product category to a north american industry classification system naics category if a match is made carbon calculator can use publicly available estimates of the carbon intensity of the naics category to make a fairly precise estimate of the carbon footprint of the item if carbon calculator is unable to find the naics category we will still make an estimate but it will be less accurate
what is coe
coe or carbon dioxide equivalent is a standard unit for measuring a carbon footprint this metric takes into account greenhouse gases ghg such as carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide and more while co is the most common green house gas other ghgs are far more harmful for the environment coe describes the different greenhouse gases as a single unit with each green house gas converted to its co equivalent ex kg of methane kg of carbon dioxide
carbon calculator uses coe to give you the most accurate measure of how much of an impact a given product has on the environment

important congressional redistricting update today a special threejudgepanel in federal court determined that the congressional district maps which were redrawn by the republican majority in  to cure congressional district maps that had been previously determined to be unconstitutional racial gerrymanders were also unconstitutional due to partisan gerrymandering the court was unanimous in its decision that when the republican majority drew its most recent congressiona  l district maps which explicitly provided for  republican congressional districts and only  democratic congressional districts that it violated the equal protection clause of the united states constitution the court in making its decision stated that on its most fundamental level partisan gerrymandering violates the core principle of republican government    that the voters should choose their representatives not the other way around when these congressional district maps were redrawn in  republican representative david lewis stated openly during a public meeting when asked why there were  districts drawn which were likely to elect republicans and only  districts drawn that were likely to elect democrats his response was i propose that we draw the maps to give a partisan advantage to ten republicans and three democrats because i do not believe its possible to draw a map with eleven republicans and two democrats lewis said at the time the court has now determined that this form of partisan gerrymandering is unconstitutional i have no doubt that this case will be appealed and ultimately heard by the united states supreme court which is already considering a case out of the state of wisconsin where partisan gerrymandering is also being questioned httpbitlycmdhb,1

here is an article i have been holding onto until after this hearing today because i wanted to see how it went before i made the post i agree  with amash here is how its going to go down folks a reader and i just had a chat whats going on is the democrats are paralyzed by fear now if you have been with me for awhile you know how i feel about this so sorry for being repetitive if you are new let me summarize for the duration of my time on this blog i had been totally against impeachment my members and i had discussed multiple reasons why that would probably be a bad idea for example we discussed the issue of having pence as our president being worse than trump himself we talked about the idea being widely unpopular we talked about the repercussions republicans faced as a results of the failed clinton impeachments and how republicans faced heavy losses in the s these are just a few however over the course of the last six months i have noticed myself and many readers having a shift in how we view the impeachment idea i find for myself i have  totally shifted my views and i say just do it my reasons for this are vast however the largest reason for this includes  pence would not be as horrific as president as he would prior to democrats taking over the house after the midterms as he would have had republicans had total control of government and republicans actually had been able to get things accomplished without a child in charge so let me just say how it is trump is most likely going to win again in  yes you are reading this correctly tump will likely win i am just saying how it is guys the fact of the matter is that democrats just cant get their act together but really a four letter word starting with an s plus nobody has been able to figure out how to successfully campaign against trump he is an anomaly he just has unfortunately brought out the worst in people that being said democrats are sitting around waiting for some ahha moment to start impeachment hearings and the moment is not going to happen so here is my point i would rather have the democrats take the risk and start the impeachment hearings at least as a way to start getting the information out there also there is a strategic reason for it democrats will not have to keep filing all these subpoena is to get information per impeachment laws if the democrats start official impeachment hearings they are legally due any information they are trying to get minus the court system minus more investigations per what would be known as the discovery process even if the preceding fails they at least took the risk here is why folks i would rather have democrats lose in  having taken the risk rather then having them have lost having done nothing if we look at history nixon was popular and even won in reelection until people found out information via his impeachment hearings thats when he was forced to resign if democrats sit and do nothing after having largely being elected because the public voted for them because they wanted this president to be held accountable and they do nothing and lose its their own fault and i am not going to defend them and go on being called a libtard for another  years moreover democrats might actually have a chance at winning if they take the chance because they could then have a case to make to americans that they were in fact the ones that tried to do the right things while republicans protected the president this is exactly how they won the midterms look impeachment is not supposed to be a widely popular and a pleasant process it is supposed to for a lack of a better word suck its supposed to be drastic and meant for the worst case if not now when can we all just collectively grow a pair,1

"coincidences that are rewarded with investments
provincial political landscape
gustavo bordet was one of the most active in the last electoral campaign and he was the one who approached encouraged and encouraged several of his peers to join the fernandezfernandez formula that role after a victory is invaluable priceless or if
there is no better way to express recognition from a peronist administration than public works to bet on growth since in this area the political decision rules in terms of determining who is awarded and who is not you have to do merit to win the support of the one with the pen forever
bordet received the minister of public works gabriel katopodis who came with favorable announcements a clear sign that alberto fernandez has it written down on the noteworthy sheet of his affections later the governor met with the chief of staff of the nation santiago cafiero they advanced in the management of international financing for strategic works for the province before organizations such as the interamerican development bank idb
in the provincial government they estimate that with the promised national aid in six months the results of the execution of the first works will be seen convinced that there is no other way to reactivate than to allocate resources to public works a creole new deal it is impressive how that moves the economy they pointed out to ratify that vision
for his part alberto needs to demonstrate that his management is not exhausted by the coronavirus which is the image that he provides to society every time he appears with axel kicillof and horacio rodriguez larreta to extend the quarantine terms and the one that by the way strengthened it positively before the public opinion
now nothing will be more useful than going out to tour the country and announcing powerful investments in works unrelated to the pandemic to expose that his government is not corseted by health and that the president is suit gives him more than that
it was an inevitable step either by advice or by political intuition to prevent the feeling that he is comfortable in the midst of the pandemic and that he forgot that his executive responsibilities go further such as attending and worrying about the effects negative economic effects of covid
the atrocious advance of the plague revalues the role of the keynesian welfare state as a social organizer in the face of catastrophe even the exacerbated neoliberals claim for a state that acts in an expeditious manner that idea of the welfare state of state intervention respect for the public the thought that salvation cannot be individual the feeling of being part of a community is today an increasingly predominant common sense

i kept seeing the adverts for oynb pop up day in and day out i had been having a niggly feeling in the back of my mind that maybe i should give this a shot i eventually took the plunge and decided i had nothing to lose after an incredibly difficult year personally i relied on alcohol to take the edge off by no means was i an alcoholic but i was what i thought a more tolerable and funnier person with it it allowed me to get out of my comfort zone and to live in a wo  rld where i didnt necessarily have to deal with what was going on i cant say that there was one trigger but there was always a reason when i was on my own for a few days to enjoy a few glasses of wine or a night out that ended in becoming an entire night and morning event whilst i am thankful i was never in a position of being out of control i could see that if i didnt reign it in that i would have gotten to that point the consideration of this challenge was made for the wellbeing of my little family for myself and for my race season that was coming up as a triathlete and runner this was where i let off steam and i wasnt going to allow alcohol to stop that from happening taking the challenge i thought honestly was going to be a walk in the park i had planned to sign up for  days in my head but when registering somehow i chose  days i expected it to be a smooth transition to controlling my intake and i kept my family and races in mind these were my reasons why i wanted to be the mum i have always been and to continue to be present for my children and not be the short tempered one i had been for a short period of time in the year i didnt want them to see me with a glass of wine in my hand i wanted to be able to train and not be tired or hungover or unprepared i never thought i suffered from anxiety before drinking nor did i really think i slept badly but i realise now that neither were true i have realised that i am now funnier and more in control of my surroundings and situations than i have ever been i have built and repaired relationships with those around me within myself and allowed a better version of me to come out for those in the future i love the time i spend with my children i have energy for days when i am with them and we have the most fun i am also incredibly confident i wake up excited to start my day and to see what adventures lies ahead for  reasons i will be able to make the best of them and i will be able to remember them my energy levels are through the roof i have done a triathlon where i reached a personal best as well as my first half marathon of kms admittedly both without training but the possibilities are endless if i put as much focus into that as i do into not drinking choosing to get out live and to really experience is easier when i am not plagued with the possibilities of what could go wrong or trying to control a situation being af has honestly set me free what ive learnt from my challenge so far is that i am the only one that can stop me living the truest version of myself since starting my challenge i have lost kgs my skin is radiant and i cannot stop smiling the anxiety i didnt think i had turns out i did and is no longer there i have mental clarity and a vision for my life one without alcohol and if i could shake someone that is or was as lost as i was that they can do it i would i am living and breathing and loving this life and i cant see how i would ever trade it in for my old one i am so proud to tell people that i am part of this challenge not because it feels like work because it doesnt no one is standing behind you telling you to be better as a community we all stand hand in hand and move with each other and shout for those ahead and pick those up who have stumbled along the way i absolutely love the sense of community we actually have our own little south african group chat which is an amazing group of diverse people within the country all uniting together to support each other and to make sure that everyone sees the sunshine in our achievements and motivate us when we are sitting staring at our alcohol cabinets like our little group the oynb challengers facebook group has an amazing following with some of the most powerful stories and some that hit home harder than i would have imagined but somehow we are all there anytime we need each other there is never a moment where we arent able to reach out that is the difference between doing it on your own and allowing others to join you on your journey not only are we inspired daily but we are placed in a position to inspire others  tamrynleigh if you want to join tamrynleigh in taking that first step to transforming your relationship with alcohol and watch your entire life transform around you you can apply to join our exclusive   or  day challenges find out more by clicking the link below,1

board chairman theodore lipscomb is pushing for spending cuts of at least  million as an alternative to approving a  vehicle registration fee increase which is the only legal option available to milwaukee county to raise significant revenue while nobody wants to pay higher fees for services and we would all agree that wed prefer if such services were free we must not accomplish this by balancing the budget on the back of the countys most vulnerable residents the  austerity measures being considered by chairman lipscomb and the county board would do just that here are just some of programs and services that their austerity measures would cut from my proposed budget cuts and layoffs at our milwaukee county parks including the closure of the mitchell park domes and boerner botanical gardens cuts to the milwaukee county transit system would result in the elimination or significant reduction of many bus routes the milwaukee county veterans services office would cease the needy veterans fund which supports veterans facing eviction and utility disconnection cuts to the medical examiner would hurt our ability to fight the opioid epidemic and worsen public safety their cuts would deny law enforcement critical tools and equipment needed to keep our communities safe cuts to the office of african american affairs would halt the progress we are making in addressing racial disparities across the county cuts to workforce development programs that help train workers  particularly in the  zip code  to learn new skills to help them find better family supporting jobs cuts to other safety net programs including housing and shelters for the homeless putting more people at risk of homelessness these are just some of the many many severe and unnecessary cuts that are being considered by the county board thankfully we can easily avoid these cuts if the county board adopts my proposed budget if we are willing to make the hard choices to find new revenues we can continue to make sustainable investments in milwaukee is future empower more people to get ahead and keep moving milwaukee forward,1

dishonest disgraceful politics as usual here we go again this past week or so a couple of our amateur pundits one local one from bainbridge island have attacked one of our planning commissioners who also happens to be running for city council the claim is that the planning commission in late  approved a plan to create subarea development around the city it just isnt true no such plan was ever on the planning commission work schedule no such plan was ever a  pproved by the planning commission here is what happened two planning commission members eric brooks and jane garrison on their own time developed a presentation on the idea of subarea development planning they wanted to present their work to the planning commission the other planning commission members were willing to hear from their colleagues under one condition they had to do so not as planning commission members but like any other citizen who might present their ideas to the commission they gave their presentation on november   afterwards they indicated a desire to take their presentation to the city council at the december   study session before doing so the planning commission wanted to make sure that it was understood that they did so again as regular citizens not as planning commission members the planning commission chair made a motion to that effect which was passed by the remaining commissioners  here is an excerpt from the official minutes of that planning commission meeting new business presentation  sammamish visioning mr eric brooks and mrs jane garrison who are current city of sammamish planning commissioners gave a presentation as citizens to the planning commission about neighborhood subarea planning the presentation demonstrated how neighborhood subarea planning can support our comprehensive plan by developing a common vision and a path to implementation motion chair shanna collins moved to recommend mr brooks and mrs garrison as citizens present their vision of neighborhood subarea planning to the city council on december   roisin ofarrell seconded motion carried unanimously  with vice chair larry crandall absent a few weeks later mr brooks and mrs garrison gave their presentation at the city council study session on the agenda it was listed as citizen presentation sammamish visioning no action as far as i know was ever taken so why did our intrepid amateur pundits gin this up to attack other members of the planning commission especially the one running for city council because it suited their political aims this was concocted to smear a good person who has contributed to our community for years and who has stepped up to serve the community into the future it was cynical when one pundit ran it up the flagpole late last year leading to abusive communications with at least one of the citizens who gave the presentation it is now even more cynical as it is hauled out of the closet to attack a candidate for council the idea of subarea planning is not new in sammamish some fifteen years or so ago something called the village concept was considered as the city looked at responding to growth requirements of the gma it got some consideration but was rejected because of possible negative implications for local neighborhoods by  the village concept was history and the current town center plan a plan that would take on required growth without affecting local neighborhoods was about to be approved since then except for the recent instance subarea planning has rarely been a part of our local conversation well there is one exception eight or nine years ago the planning commission and council were looking at a possible annexation of the socalled notch a tract of land on duthie hill road that inexplicably protrudes into sammamish although it has never been annexed to sammamish at the time one planning commissioner was enthusiastically championing a subarea plan that would situate some kind of commercial area or shopping mall in that space can you guess who that planning commissioner was if you guessed scott hamilton one of our amateur pundits youd be exactly right god help the people of bainbridge island if we had a real newspaper some of this nonsense would be called out but in the echo chamber of our social media bad actors such as our pundits can thrive,1

did you know that right now the timeshare giants are fighting hard to outlaw the entire timeshare cancellation industry at first glance this seems insane considering the timeshare cancellation industry exists to help timeshare owners who have been lied to and misled escape horrific amp binding timeshare contracts who wouldnt want that however when considered for a moment it makes a lot of sense but well talk more about this in a moment for now i want to ask you a s  ingle question would you still own your timeshare if you had had a  hour grace period to decide whether or not you should buy the timeshare let me explain most timeshare pitches are incredibly high pressure and you must decide whether or not you will buy the same day you do a timeshare tour they often mislead you into thinking that they are offering an incredible deal but this deal only lasts for that day if you leave today you wont be able to buy again at this price first this is a lie second the only reason they do this is to pressure you to buy it is one of the many common lies that we hear everyday working with our clients which is why we feel it is so critical to ensure the timeshare owner is represented and protected by the timeshare cancellation industry if you dont already know me my name is chuck mcdowell and i am the father of the timeshare cancellation industry and this isnt the first time the timeshare industry has tried to bully me several years ago i was sued for  million by the largest timeshare company in the world they were not very happy when i defeated them in federal court i stood my ground when others shut their doors because i knew there were millions of timeshare owners who had been lied to during their timeshare experience i also knew if i folded to the timeshare giants demands they would never stop taking advantage of timeshare owners yet again myself and wesley financial group are having to stand up to the timeshare giants to protect timeshare owners as i mentioned before right now the timeshare giants are trying to sneak legislation that would outlaw the entire timeshare cancellation industry they want to make it illegal to help timeshare owners this would be devastating for the millions of timeshare owners who have been lied to and mislead during their timeshare experience we are going to fight their legislation tooth and nail because we know it is the right thing to do if you own timeshare heres what i ask first answer the question from earlier would you have still purchased your timeshare if you had had a  hour grace period to decide whether or not you should purchase the timeshare why or why not second if youd like to learn if you could qualify for timeshare cancellation we have a short quiz that thousands of timeshare owners have already taken in this quiz youll find out if theres a chance we can help you plus youll learn a bit about us and why we exist and finally if theres a good chance you might qualify well send you a package in the mail that will teach you everything you need to know about how to get rid of your timeshare once and for all i founded this industry because i knew there were good people stuck in bad situations wesley financial group has grown to nearly  employees who come to work every day to help good timeshare owners who feel stuck in bad timeshare contracts we fight every day and we will continue to fight until every mislead timeshare owner has the opportunity to get out sincerely chuck mcdowell owner of wesley financial group father of the timeshare cancellation industry,1

for love and humanity flatout free  new hope box plus free justice offer combines for a  value with just  purchase  four years ago today  our president rolled out his campaign including the words likewise tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border no one with any sense of history has any doubts about who he was channeling four years ago many hoped this was not who he really was but just a cynical ploy to stand out in a crowded f  ield but if there were any doubts or feelings this was just an act on this the fourth anniversary of his launching his campaign with such cruel calculated words that doubt has long vanished each day as we learn more from the camps where asylum seekers are being separated from their children and concentrated in unhealthy living conditions the toll of his dehumanizing of others becomes more clear that so many republicans have simply embraced the motto of the first ladys i really dont care jacket is actually kind of heartbreaking two years ago we did a giveaway on this anniversary to bring attention to his nazistyle dehumanization of others just trying to find some way to bring attention to just how much more dangerous this president is to america and the offer was well received yes at least from the time of nixon on theres been a pretty open embrace of racism by the republican party but as truly horrible as racism is what this president is doing is something much worse to believe yourself better than others because of race is rotten to the core but to arrive at the point where you no longer see others as even human is where things go frighteningly wrong history shows again and again that unless we find a way to block the path the republicans are now on or turn them to another direction a whole lot of good decent innocent people are going to end up losing their lives we can quibble about do we now have actual concentration camps in america what is clear is that manymany republican voters are looking at camps where humans are facing intentionallycreated suffering and seeing no real problem with it if they are not objecting now will they object to the next step or the step after that hopefully we never find out a big part of what makes cooks so valuable is their ability to find the silver lining in every cloud those up to no good know the value in hopelessness over the years ive come to believe that what makes cooks so valuable is that no matter the message those up to no good are spreading cooks simply refuse to abandon all hope no matter what cooks embrace hope always have always will and when times reach their worst that hope makes all the difference but i have to admit for the last couple of years for these july th offers ive had a hard time creating the sense of hope that if we are going to live up to our voice of cooking trademark we always need to be able to find this year is different this year finally there actually is new hope though you dont see it brought up much these past few months the  election changed everything that was a good night in the vote totals we all found the proof we so needed that real america is still very much alive in the overwhelming rejection of republicans across the board including twelve million more votes for democratic senate candidates than republican ones the true story of america was shouted from the rooftops for all to hear the only reason this administration still holds the white house is because of the length of time between presidential elections america doesnt want him and of course there is no reason to trust this president and his republican supporters in congress and there is every reason to fear the hurt he will inflict in the time he has left so we must all work to minimize that hurt still come the night of  one of league of extraordinary candidates the democratic party is now fielding will take back the white house for the people of this nation as long as we dont lose hope as long as we get everyone we know to vote and as long as we stand together against the inhumanity that has captured the republican party the reality is the future is already certain lets all do all we can to keep hope alive at penzeys weve found that a good message travels far but a good message combined with a great offer with your sharing has no limits to its reach so for two days through sunday night  we are doing our best to shine a

thanks good gifts and the dangers of the nationalist republican party it really is just common everyday fascism dressed up with an orange bow on top and  off the minimum for free shipping too first off thank you thank you thank you thank you all of you have every right to feel good about who you are and the difference you make there will be those disappointed that races that could have been won werent and i get that especially with the role voter suppressio  n played in some of those and there will be others working to distract you from how overwhelming turnout was tuesday and how much of a rejection the turnout was of the current administration dont let them distract you now is your time to rejoice in the disaster you averted from the womens march to election day so many did so much to defend the values of this country i salute all of you so rejoice relax and then get ready for the next two years of this the threat that is the nationalist republican party is far from over yes there will be advantages in  in turnout and in how many senate seats they will have to defend but next time it will be the president on the ticket and where he campaigned the most is where they most outperformed the polls the reality is the amount of hate let loose in this country these past two years has opened the doors to even more hate to come these are the days where the kindness of cooks will mean everything with nationalist republicanism anything that makes us different makes us dangerous so we see the mocking of the disabled the mocking of the women brave enough to speak out against assault attacks on people for their faith skin color sexual orientation and identity what they are feeding their followers is just repackaged fascism its not a healthy diet how many times do they have to call for withholding lifesaving health insurance from those with preexisting conditions before we admit what they really are calling for now is no time to let down our guard but it is a time to take pride yes even america is not immune to these forces but in how quickly we found ourselves responding to this threat and in how great our numbers have become is the proof that there is more than just a spark of our greatness still alive within us in america what makes us different makes us great in america what makes us different makes us america out of manyone i love this country and as much as i wish that  marked the beginning of the end of the nationalist republican movement it doesnt this weekend as we go about our lives they are working behind the scenes to place themselves above the law there will be bad days ahead this will not be over quickly but what  was is what churchill called the end of the beginning as long as we dont let them wear us out as long as we remain vigilant victory is certain  showed the world that after  years the majority of americans have no desire to see our neverending revolution for evergreater equality come to a halt now and for that i thank you

"the three things that now need to happen if the transformation of farnham is town centre is finally to take off my column in this week is herald
last week is news that a farnham project board has been set up to oversee recommendations for a multimillion pound transformation of the town may strike some sceptics as yet another bureaucratic exercise or talking shop but as someone who has campaigned for many years on issues such as pollution in the town centre pedestrianisation and a wrecclesham relief road i am genuinely optimistic that things will be different this time
i speak as someone who has had their fair share of setbacks after hitting a brick wall six years ago i assembled a group of people to fund a referendum to find out what the town actually thought we won it but by just  the narrowness of the margin reflected concerns about practicalities rather than principle which had widespread support
why am i more optimistic this time firstly because we have the wholehearted support of tim oliver the leader of surrey county council who has thrown his weight behind transforming one of only a few major towns in surrey that still routes traffic right through its centre i have learned the hard way that nothing will ever happen if we do not have the support of our three councils so the enthusiastic support of john ward leader of waverley and john neale leader of farnham town council is also extremely welcome the fact that between us we are from different political parties is also important because it makes it more likely we can achieve a broad consensus in the town for the same reason it is particularly encouraging that the town is three county councillors wyatt ramsdale stephen spence and andy mcleod are all working closely together to take things forward
three things now need to happen to make what has too often felt like an impossible dream actually come true
firstly the project board whilst it rightly comprises of the town is political leadership does not itself represent the broad crossspectrum of opinion in the town andy mcleod and john neale have therefore taken responsibility for making sure we listen to the many diverse voices in the town from established organisations such as the farnham society and the chamber of commerce to the voices of those with families young people pensioners cyclists and commuters we must make sure everyone is listened to carefully before any decisions are made
secondly we are all going to need to compromise if we are to be successful i have often joked that farnham is the only town in the country with  traffic engineers but we are actually lucky to have a wealth of specialist knowledge in our midst we all have our own priorities usually relating to where we live and how we use the town but whether we opt for full pedestrianisation or  ishared spaces parttime or full time closure of roads the borough or a wider footprint are all decisions which will require compromises between competing priorities
we also need to be honest that if we make any changes to traffic patterns there will disruption not least for those driving cars many of whom will continue to need to drive the hope is that any changes will settle down over time as people get used to them and adjust habits not least in the context of the big changes that are happening anyway with brightwells but it will take time for things to work themselves out and we should not pretend otherwise
finally we need to be open about the elephant in the room which is that we have not yet secured funding for any of the schemes we are hoping to progress transforming a town is inevitably a chicken and egg process no funding can be secured until you have a viable scheme with public support so that is what we are working on first but postcoronavirus it is not going to be easy to get funding as your local mp i will be working alongside our local councillors to make the strongest possible case and with the pressing need to eliminate dangerous pollution from one of the most beautiful and historic towns in the south east what could make a more powerful and compelling cause",1

from mary flynn access to justice attorney kate harrison an independent thinker the easy road is to accept the common wisdom of one side or the other the harder road is carefully examining issues and deciding on facts  kate  took her experience designing judicial performance systems throughout the world to craft a responsible police accountability measure that makes the few investigations into alleged police misconduct more transparent and professional the city manager continues to manage the department and the city council still sets policy  using her years of public sector budgeting expertise helped design a strong budget reserve policy for the city that restricts use of reserve funds to very specific emergency circumstances the council should not be able to raid these funds  listened to the entire community and voted for the recent sidewalk ordinance that limits the amount of objects on our streets to protect health and safety and allow everyone to enjoy our commons but kate also revised the item to make sure that health and human services rather than the police be the first to talk to people on the streets and that poverty isnt criminalized by providing connections to community services and jobs like those offered by the new downtown streets team instead of fines that will never be paid kate has been endorsed by  gordon wozniak former councilmember for her acumen in budgeting  george perezvelez councilmember wengrafs appointee to the police review commission for her commonsense approach to police accountability  the alameda county democratic lawyers club for her knowledge and experience in government as karen weinstein peralta community college director stated while here in berkeley we like to put our candidates in one or the other camp kate is something special  independent in thought and action which is why i support her for berkeley city council district  join those who have examined the record vote for kate mary lavery flynn attorneyaccess to justice consultant,1

are we here at this point in time like the people in genesis were posted by admin on wed oct   it is time to come home to jesus to be saved by him or be condemned by him it is all up to youso what are you waiting for are we here at this point in time like the people in genesis were by jimmie w warren genesis   and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually and it repented the lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and the lord said i will destroy man whom i have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for it repenteth me that i have made them god may be ready to send out these seven angles of revelations our time revelation   then i heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels go pour out the seven bowls of yahweh is wrath on the earth the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the land and ugly and painful sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped his image the second angel poured out his bowl on the sea and it turned into blood like that of a dead man and every living thing in the sea died the third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water and they became blood then i heard the angel in charge of the waters say you are just in these judgments you who are and who were the holy oneyehsua messiah because you have so judged for they have shed the blood of your saints and prophets and you have given them blood to drink as they deserve and i heard the altar respond yes lord god almighty true and just are your judgments the fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun and the sun was given power to scorch people with fire they were seared by the intense heat and they cursed the name of god who had control over these plagues but they refused to repent and glorify him the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast and his kingdom was plunged into darkness men gnawed their tongues in agony and cursed the god of heaven because of their pains and their sores but they refused to repent of what they had done the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river euphrates and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the east then i saw three evil spirits that looked like frogs they came out of the mouth of the dragon out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet they are spirits of demons performing miraculous signs and they go out to the kings of the whole world to gather them for the battle on the great day of god almighty behold i come like a thief blessed is he who stays awake and keeps his clothes with him so that he may not go naked and be shamefully exposed then they gathered the kings together to the place that in hebrew is called armageddon the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air and out of the temple came a loud voice from the throne saying it is done then there came flashes of lightning rumblings peals of thunder and a severe earthquake no earthquake like it has ever occurred since man has been on earth so tremendous was the quake the great city split into three parts and the cities of the nations collapsed god remembered babylon the great and gave her the cup filled with the wine of the fury of his wrath every island fled away and the mountains could not be found look around at all the sin going on all around the globe men and women killing each other for what wars every where you look and it is only getting worse is it not you need to wake up to the world events that is taking us to the doom and end of all mankind  today we are closer to nuking each other than we were in the  is and  is  it is just a matter of time when some dictator pushes the button or our own president making every other ruler with the bomb push their buttons and boom  of us will not be here  again are we near the end of these evil days  and god saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually are you or your families ready for the day of the lord just think about all that has to happen before yeshuajesus comes back do you even know what your bible says about the last days or endtimes do you say to yourself  i am a christian and shall except all the horrible things that will befall mankind  but are you really are you following what christ taught in the new testament are you as close to god as you think you are do you even really know almighty god yahweh and his only begotten son yeshua jesus by whose name you or i are saved where are you going to stand at the endtime judgment day revelation   and i saw an angel coming down out of heaven having the key to the abyss and holding in his hand a great chain he seized the dragon that ancient serpent who is the devil or satan and bound him for a thousand years he threw him into the abyss and locked and sealed it over him to keep him from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended after that he must be set free for a short time i saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge and i saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony for jesus and because of the word of god they had not worshiped the beast or his image and had not received his mark on their foreheads or their hands they came to life and reigned with christ a thousand years the rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended this is the first resurrection blessed and holy are those who have part in the first resurrection the second death has no power over them but they will be priests of god and of christ and will reign with him for a thousand years satan is doom when the thousand years are over satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earthgog and magog possible russia and chinato gather them for battle in number  they are like the sand on the sea shore they marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of god is people the city he loves but fire came down from heaven and devoured them and the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown they will be tormented day and night for ever and ever the dead are judged then i saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it earth and sky fled from his presence and there was no place for them and i saw the dead great and small standing before the throne and books were opened another book was opened which is the book of life the dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books the sea gave up the dead that were in it and death and hades gave up the dead that were in them and each person was judged according to what he had done then death and hades were thrown into the lake of fire the lake of fire is the second death do you study his word  the holy bible or do you just sit in some church somewhere and listen to some man or women read from it or from booklets some of these churches claim to be the only true church of god head quarters and they only print gods word to better clarify the bible to better serve you maybe you have heard of these kinds of churches even in one of them now maybe you follow a man who calls himself the vicar of christ  vicar means in place of from rome maybe or maybe another city like salt lake city where they have an leaderapostle who is figure like god making all the choices for their people  or maybe you are a jehovah witness or maybe a member of the worldwide church of god or their break off churches where some men claim to be from god all of them plus many many more claim to be the one true church how can they all be the only true church of god dont you think you should know what yeshuajesus really taught and what yahweh our father god wants you to know about him and his soon coming kingdom   john    beloved do not believe every spirit but test the spirits to see whether they are from god for many false prophets have gone out into the world by this you know the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ has come in the flesh is from god and every spirit that does not confess jesus is not from god this is the spirit of the antichrist which you heard was coming and now is in the world already little children you are from god and have overcome them for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world they are from the world therefore they speak from the world and the world listens to them we are from god whoever knows god listens to us whoever is not from god does not listen to us by this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error beloved let us love one another for love is from god and whoever loves has been born of god and knows god anyone who does not love does not know god because god is love all who say jesus christ is not the son of god is a liar and the truth is not in them do you know how to study your bible  or do you just follow along with your minister as they read if the read from it at all now there are some who read from articles of the church paper or pamphlets or from booklets given to them from headquarters then preach as if these booklets were from god himself  most of these even though they are made up from church or man made doctrine are told you that they are reading from gods word please do not let religion trick you  read and study your own bibles so you know the truth have you ever asked yourself what if my ministers are wrong where would that put you and your family after all it is your eternal life that is at risk  i am asking you to think about what you are being taught in your church and the only way to know is to open your bibles and read it yourself i was once blind but now i see  one day back in  almighty god yahweh opened my eyes to see  that what i once thought and believed was  which i was told that we were in the only true church of god  was in fact a big deceitful lie again please read and study your own bibles so you will know the truth maybe you are in one of these kinds of churches right now you may be told that you do not have to read the bible for yourself  because you will not understand it anyway so just follow along your ministers may be telling and teaching you the real truth but how would you know if you have not read the bible or studied it to know they are or not teaching the truth if you are in one of these kind of churches get out now before it is too late most of these kinds of churches teach from doctrines of angles and men most teach religion and just use the bible enough to have you believe their booklets or some other books not of god do not be deceived by their ways as they just want you to follow them and they will deceive you from the true way of gods holy word  your own bible pick it up and read it for yourself  see what it teaches you will be surprised what it really teaches but if you have an open mind and want to know what is true and what is religion then  ask the lord to open your mind to know his truth read and study my article let no man deceive you please use your bible to read it yourself  peter    but there were also false prophets among the people just as there will be false teachers among you they will secretly introduce destructive heresies even denying the sovereign lord who bought them there are so many people teaching that jesus was just a man or prophet of god and not the son of the living god this is antichrist  if this is so then the lord knows how to rescue godly men from trials and to hold the unrighteous for the day of judgment while continuing their punishment this is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the sinful nature and despise authority bold and arrogant but these men blaspheme in matters they do not understand they are like brute beasts creatures of instinct born only to be caught and destroyed and like beasts they too will perish yes people  we are living in the last time right now these words are paraphrased from the book of  peter and may be read by going to your own bibles for better understanding  i heard one women say at church that it was up to her minister to preach the truth after all she paid her tithe and came to church every week end and if she went to hell it wouldnt be her fault it would be the ministers faultis this women right no of corse not god gave us his holy word the bible to read ourself to learn of his plan and then he sent his only begotten son jesus to die for you and me so we can be saved amen how wonderful that is grace and salvation how many of you think because you go to church and give money and sing songs that this will save you i tell you now study your bibles for the end is near i know you have heard from the time you can remember  that the end is near  and many men and women have even set dates fooling many how ever  sooner or later the end time will be upon us all we all need to be prepared and ready for our last day  once again you do not have to believe what is written here but i would ask you to at least read it with the scriptures provided then make up your own minds do not be afraid of learning something your church does not preach because they may not be using the bible to teach you in the first place ask questions finally in closing dear friends i wanted to encourage you to study the bible everyday as our time is short before our king of kings will be arriving to share eternity with those who know his truth  peter   we who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of yahweh the father through the sanctifying work of the spirit for obedience to jesus christ and sprinkling by his blood grace and peace be yours in abundance praise to elohim for a living hope and eternal grace given by him to all mankind praise be to the yahweh the father of our lord jesus christ in his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of jesus christ from the dead and into an inheritance that can never perish spoil or fadekept in heaven for you who through faith are shielded by yahweh is power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time if you live to be a hundred years old your time is still short for one day each of us will stand before the lord and have to give an answer for what we know and what we did with the word we heard amen your humble servant in the name of jesus christ chaplain jimmie warren  simple salvation

one of the major changes we are seeing in american society is the increased role that grandparents are playing in raising their grandchildren approximately  million grandparents are actually the ones raising the grandchildren many millions more grandparents play a significant role assisting in the raising of their grandchildren on a day to day basis  whether it be driving them to school or to sports or other after school activities or just old fashioned babysitting  there are any number of reasons for this change but whatever the reasons there has been a large increase in single parent homes as well as homes where both parents are employed full time  and grandparents must play an essential role with their grandchildren this increased role can have a significant impact on grandparents lives  particularly those grandparents who are actually raising their grandchildren in this era of the opioid crisis that is why i am a prime initial sponsor of the supporting grandparents raising grandchildren act hr  which will create a federal task force focused on developing and making available information designed to help grandparents the task force would examine data to address mental health issues drug abuse educational issues and the best way to create a healthy environment for kids in today is fast changing world i realize that a federal task force will not be a magic answer or a silver bullet and that there is no substitute for a grandparent is common sense and life experience but it can add to the body of knowledge and help drive a national discussion on this changing dynamic in american life  and help make it a positive change let the discussion begin paid for by pete king for congress,1
linda brown was at the center of one of the most important legal cases in us history brown v board of education which led to the legal desegregation of american schools brown died on sunday at the age of  in  browns father oliver tried to enrol linda in a whitesonly elementary school a few blocks from their home in topeka kansas linda had to take a bus across town to get to the black school she attended her father felt that it was wrong for black people to  have to accept secondclass citizenship and that meant being segregated in their schools when in fact there were schools right in their neighborhoods that they could attend she told pbs in a  interview oliver brown partnered with the naacp and became the first plaintiff in what eventually became five coordinated lawsuits in kansas delaware south carolina virginia and the district of columbia in  the us supreme court unanimously ruled that segregated schools were inherently unequal that ruling ultimately inspired many of the civil rights marches and protests of the s and s and eventually led to the enactment of the civil rights act of  and a number of other legal decisions that helped advance the rights of black americans as an adult linda brown carried on her fathers fight for civil and educational rights she eventually became a public speaker and an educational consultant and in  she was one of the plaintiffs that reopened the original brown case arguing that topeka had not fully followed through with integration that case eventually resulted in a desegregation plan for the school district and the opening of several magnet schools school integration remains a huge uphill battle though many indicators show that since the mid s schools are actually resegregating largely because neighborhoods are highly segregated schools in the south are now as segregated as they were in  and a recent study from the us government accountability office found that from  to  the number of public schools with very high percentages of students who were black or hispanic and living in poverty had increased from  to and that those schools often had less resources and poorer education quality but theres no question that brown v board has helped set in motion some of the most significant legal gains for racial equality in american history and as linda brown pointed out in  it was a huge win for the basic dignity of millions of americans i really think of it in terms of what it has done for our young people in taking away that feeling of second class citizenship she said art by grace berr��os words by allie jaynes,1

it was also specified that this civic guard will not be paid will not have uniforms or public order tasks but only for purposes of utility and solidarity
that is they will not be used for anything
in fact in the majority itself there is no full political agreement because it is not considered an effective measure by many but rather useless
this government rather would not do better to take care of the money promised to companies which are not there of the redundancy fund that has not been activated of the  cent masks which if there are have reached the epidemic almost ended at the landings of illegal immigrants who produced the bellanova amnesty of the activities that will not reopen with consequent unemployment and ultimately of the flight of foreign companies from italy such as arcelor mittal whirlpool of naples jabil of marcianise

judicial primary elections cancelled at this time the nc senate passed a conference report known as the electoral freedom act of  this is a rather deceptive name for a bill which has eliminated the requirement for a primary election for any judges running for election in this state regardless of whether they are running for seats on the nc supreme court the nc court of appeals for superior courts or for district court judgeships normally candidates running for thes  e judgeships would have filed a notice of candidacy in february and they would have participated in primary elections held in may as it presently stands these candidates will not have to file a notice of candidacy until june th  and no later than pm on june th  there is also no requirement for a primary election typically when a primary election is held the  highest votegetters participate in the november general election however if no primary election is scheduled then you can end up with perhaps a dozen candidates running in a judicial contest and the candidate who wins could potentially receive only  of the vote which would be a rather startling outcome as it presently stands it appears that the general assembly will hold a special session in january to examine the possibility of adopting new judicial districts for our state for judges serving in our district and superior courts as well as for district attorneys at that time it is also possible that a constitutional amendment could be proposed that could be placed on the ballot for voters to consider as early as the may  primary which could result in the adoption of a new judicial appointmentsmerit selection process this new merit selection process could allow the republican majority in the general assembly to appoint judges in our state the constitutional amendment can also create what is known as judicial retention elections where a judge holding office would just be voted in or out of office but the person would not be running against another candidate all of this can have profound ramifications which i would encourage each of you to closely follow as this process moves forward it is essential that the public have confidence and trust in the integrity of our judges and in our judicial system we should clearly avoid any process that politicizes judges serving on our courts please continue to track this process i have been following it closely and some of the changes that have been proposed give me great concern there was absolutely no reason to cancel primaries for any candidate running for the nc supreme court or the nc court of appeals since those courts will not be impacted by the redrawing of judicial districts however they could be impacted if judicial retention elections are approved as a result of the passing of a constitutional amendment this is probably why they have canceled those primaries as well,1

"in this hard time it is good to remember how strong we can be together
last weekend i started getting calls from firefighters police officers and first responders around the state on the front lines in our battle with coronavirus they would been promised personal protective equipment face masks especially to protect our community
for weeks the masks they were promised had not come some agencies were moving to what they call crisis use where they would take masks that should have been used once and use them  times
i started making calls to see what we could get done here is the thing when i told people that we needed to get masks for our first responders every single person i called said yes
volunteers said what can i do the st louis fire foundation stepped forward donors said yes i called people around the country and some around the globe to find the gear we needed and everyone helped
that was sunday night the next day we signed a contract today we delivered gear and the rest of it will be with our first responders tomorrow
nearly  masks
having had my hands on the problem i can tell you that there is absolutely no reason why our front line organizations should not have the gear that they need to protect themselves their families and all of us
people stepped forward and we got it done
we got requests from and were able to get gear for the st louis fire department cape county fire department cape county sheriff is office st louis police department jackson pd st louis county pd kansas city police department cass county sheriff is office harrisonville pd new madrid county sheriff is office scott county sheriff is office platte county sheriff is office raytown pd st joseph pd buchanan county sheriff is office andrew county sheriff is office savannah pd cameron pd clinton county sheriff is office davies county sheriff is office harrison county sheriff is office and bethany pd nodaway county sheriff is office maryville pd
this work has not solved the problem not even close our first responders and our medical professionals are going to need a lot more gear and support in the days weeks and months ahead
but as we step up to the great challenge before us remember two things
 when we come together we are capable of anything
 when we say we got your back we mean it

"quarantine numbers e not yes bad
it seems to me to be the worst when there is neither good nor bad and just that on average in the middle and do not be happy but no energy exchange has been found
a fragment of a true story names and clothes changed
i talk to kristina the sales manager in a regular individual session on energy
in front of me an impressive woman perfectly lying blonde hair dark blue suit makeup like ashes from the catalog and ashes of enthusiasm in the faded eyes im wondering what is going on here
do you like your job
well it is not that bad already
what do you mean
good salary new car ski vacation familiar customers
i feel like something is wrong here
but are you really good i cant hear the enthusiasm in my voice
pause
well not very good
would you like to change anything
contemplation in the eyes
no another pause apparently it is not that bad anymore
tylim the same thought seems to be on both minds unfortunately it is not so bad already
we usually change something only when it really becomes unbearable or when the environment forces it children are born companies go bankrupt employees leave quarantine begins until a serious crisis strikes we will tolerate a little bad and where are those limits of tolerance our psyche and body are highly adaptive able to adapt to the most difficult circumstances and often save but sometimes the opposite is true we suddenly wake up and ask ourselves jesus how did i get here
if the situation deteriorates gradually we adapt and forget so that we can live and work much better and more pleasantly we become victims of our adaptability someone wrote that a frog thrown into boiling water jumps out but if you let it into the cold and slowly heat it it boils i do not know ive never dared to torture an innocent animal like that but im enough people to do the same
i keep hearing im not living well what does bad mean that you dont have to carry water from a well that we buy pork at the store and not grow a barn that i have a washing machine and not a hand washing machine that we scream at each other at home but dont hit each other
but do we feel joy fullness confidence and pride do i have a lot of energy and enthusiasm or do we enjoy going to work in the morning and returning home in the evening
who is experiencing all this may continue not to read this essay i do not invite them to consider the rest
a situation where it is not so bad is a treacherous trap we do not feel comfortable but the big bad has not come yet so we do not want to change anything even though we are not happy some people spend their entire lives or careers in this state it is common to justify such a gray being it will never be very good you will always have to make compromises or our grandparents did it badly and we really shouldnt complain knowing what i remember during the last plague in  every third inhabitant of the grand duchy of lithuania died it is the covid child game that complains
it may not be possible without compromise but how many can we afford and want to afford remembering the allegory of dead horses people like to say that one way or another all horses are a little worn out and nowhere will be completely good not worth looking for
when do i have to say to myself everything will be enough i want to change how long can i deceive myself with impunity and stay in an area of stability that is in fact neither credible nor pleasant
any change is a risk because we sail into unknown waters where dangerous creatures can breed and unfavorable winds blow which is why we often stay in the port convincing ourselves that there may be nothing here at all we plow an old furrow until someone forces us to raise our heads and look around the worst happens when it is not so bad because then we dont change anything and the iceberg on which we live gradually melts when we found ourselves in the waves we were suddenly surprised oh what happened here now
at one conference i watched young executives share their impressions of selling abroad and the majority of the audience silently looked at them like exotic animals and carved their ears why are lithuanian sellers and companies so avoiding new markets
why is it rare for someone who is determined to change a profession they have studied for years and where they have had some such careers but without joy and enthusiasm
because there are unknown waters incomprehensible people and a few other laws to which we have to adapt
but if we do not go to those new seas we will not learn anything new we will not find new opportunities we will not meet new people and life will not be so colorful true some feel good and pastel in an environment where everything is quiet and normal but does it inspire enthusiasm and energy to do something significant
and when some virus breaks out into change we turn a blind eye and complain that the devil is getting here who woke me up
hearing that a climber has fallen off the ice wall in the mountains they say that it is better not to go to the mountains after reading that a diver has drowned we decide that we will never dive anywhere too dangerous when we notice that a startup has gone bankrupt we explain to everyone that it is nonsense to start a business having experienced that a new product has not worked we close the drawer with new ideas and stick to the old tested things
a shield on the road vilnius kaunas announces that so many people have died this year is it not behind the wheel now and what do you do doing nothing without waiting and waiting safely for death ready for the coffin with the most fashionable graves enjoy lukewarm success and comfort that equally not bad everywhere
each of us has a different tolerance for risk some want to be fully assured of the future while others are determined to jump off the bridge without even knowing if there is water at the bottom apparently neither will make discoveries or write about them in the times some drowned quietly dropping an anchor in a quiet estuary as the ship would just roll over for decades while others would shut up without achieving anything because they fell headlong forward unable to understand what they were doing the truth is probably somewhere in the middle but it is quite clear that the trap of a little bit of such comfort enters a swamp from which it is very difficult to get out
is parking in the marina really safer than sailing in the open unknown sea
true when you leave the port you may float on a reef get lost fall overboard or meet a poor shark and who said life could be completely safe we would like that so sometimes we hang on to old familiar ordinary things as if they guarantee us peace and success
the world is changing at an incredible rate and it is becoming more and more exciting to participate in that stream all the more so as i have no choice we may not achieve all our goals if we take risks but we are guaranteed to have mercy on having spent our lives not so badly
think about it do you want to continue to be where you are today
do you enjoy the fullness of your profession
are you happy to get out of bed on mondays are your eyes burning
do you really want to continue to live not so bad
if not look around maybe it is time to anchor
restless days for you today

"hi all with the uk moving into the next phase of its covid response i thought it would be good to provide an update on the work rbwm and its partners are doing to support residents with their housing needs i also wanted to set out how we are looking to improve the service with a refresh of our homelessness strategy
our work continues to be underpinned by the critical values of compassion thoroughness cooperation
 rough sleepers
over  vulnerable people formally sleeping on the streets of rbwm have either been accommodated in bed and breakfast accommodation or reconnected to the local authority they have a local connection with the team have also
we have been working with our charitable partners to ensure that all accommodated individuals have access to breakfast lunch and evening meal
all accommodated individuals are contacted every day by their outreach officer to provide ongoing support and advice week days
as a reminder if you are concerned about someone sleeping rough in rbwm please use the link below to make a referral through streetlink
alternatively if you see anyone rough sleeping you can make direct contact with the team on the duty number   or email housingrbwmgovuk we will make every effort to make contact with all rough sleepers and bring them in from the streets via the pathway or reconnection for outside working hours please call the normal rbwm out of hours phone number
 charitable partners
a hug ethank you to all our charitable partners for working with us in a cooperative and constructive fashion to ensure vulnerable people including our rough sleepers are receiving food parcels and other support
there are too many to list indeed i missed out browns cic in the video who have been doing fantastic work to support our stage  guests in john west house ie the people who are receiving intensive support our stage  guests were moved out following government advice to shut dormitorystyle accomodation
 housing support
there has been a significant increase in housing support within rbwm since the covid crisi began and rbwm are responding by expanding our stock of goodquality temporary accomodation and working with residents whilst they are finding longer term solutions such as finding new employment etc
we are always on the look out for more goodquality temporary accomodation so if you have any empty property please do let us know
 homelessness strategy refresh
we are holding a workshops next week with our key partners staff and councillors to take forward the refresh of our homelessness strategy this will be followed up with a survey to our patners so we can be sure weve captured all the key ideas for how we can improve our service this is all about being open transparent and constructive
you may recall that i lead of the delivery of our existing strategy a couple of years ago and now that the service has been massively improved we are ready to take things onto the next level and build a bestinclass service
we want to see those who use our service put at the heart of our new strategy for example we are looking at how we can ensure the service is flexible enough to respond to residents working habits so we dont require people to take days off to attend assessments etc
as ever this work will be underpinned by the core values of compassion thoroughness and cooperation",1

reasons why you should go to the mcclintock town hall the roseville town hall in february had about  people  of them resistance the recent mcclintock town hall in foresthill had about and  resistance he doesnt listen he isnt going to change his mind he is a lost cause this may all be true but it is not why we go to town halls showing up at town halls is one of the core tactics to influence your members of congress moc as described in the indivisible guide this tactic comes from the success that the tea party had in influencing congress as described it in the town hall memo in  many have credited the phone calls and showing up to town halls with saving the aca but we still have lots to resist so  reasons you should go to the next mcclintock town hall  it isnt really about changing his mind but changing the narrative the far right feels emboldened our presence can have a moderating effect  all moc are enormously concerned about their image in the district and they will work very hard to avoid signs of public dissent or disapproval a huge crowd is a sure sign  an overwhelming showing of dissent threatens the narrative that he is popular is supported and shares the values of his constituents this will unnerve him and can influence his decision making even in subtle ways  you just might influence the staffers and staffers who are the ones who do most of the work and give our moc policy recommendations  it is important to be seen in the media and therefore the wider public that there is resistance to mcclintock  bad press for mcclintock since reps are elected every two years they are always either running for office or getting ready for their next election many in the district dont have much of an opinion about him the more we can get dissent for him in the media  the more people will question him and be willing to vote for someone else  it is important for future candidates moc in other districts and our senators to see support for our point of view  we do not want the resistance to appear weak disorganized and to be fizzling out that isnt who we are  we are showing dissent not just to mcclintock but to the entire regressive populist and nationalistic agenda of the trumppence administration  it is a great place to recruit new activists and network bring a card bring a sheet cake and have some fun we hope to see many of you there wednesday september    pm in angels camp on wednesday september th at  pm bret harte high school gym  murphys grade road angels camp comment here if you need a ride or want to carpool and well try to connect as many of you as we can,1

"bogdan gheorghiu pnl deputy
mr ioan stan and the selected company in order to justify the fact that they violated all medical protocols on march   presenting themselves at the suceava county hospital for the covid test are embarrassingly related to the situation of president flutur fortunately for their lords and we continue to wish them health they were perfectly healthy unlike gheorghe flutur who went through illness and convalescence the question is why didnt you go to the dsp and go unconscious instead of going to the hospital which could be a driver of communitybased transmission of this virus
in absolutely all civilized countries those who hold decisionmaking positions must and are tested with priority because the state of health of a responsible person influences his activity in the service of the community
in the end mr stan as a direct contact seems to meet the eligibility criteria for testing but the others as alleged secondary contacts by no means had anything to look for there i repeat fortunately they had negative results and a period of  days of isolation a period that they used to the full for political conspiracies and false attacks
but in an attempt to strike at gheorghe flutur who was politely aligned with all political opponents and ordered press campaigns to destroy his image they hit suceava bucovina people and doctors at suceava county hospital
gentlemen the medical staff at sju went through the hardest period there was no need for political pressure with the smell of election campaigns an elementary reasoning doubled by some common sense would have made you see that the small team from the infectious diseases department of the county hospital has managed about  cases of people infected with this type of coronavirus almost  times more than the number of patients managed by matei bals hospital in bucharest with much more human and material resources this political attack strikes these people it strikes those whom you have deprived of the medical services and so limited from suceava
i dont even want to think about how rigorous the dignitaries from psd were when through their recent speeches they wanted to divide the people of bucovina by the continuous and constant attempt to discredit the man who over time fought and continues to fight for the interests of suceava gheorghe flutur",1

"the meanwhile and the after
by rock
this quarantine put us to the test
in this meanwhile we learned to know our limits to live together to know each other better to think
as a society it was a challenge since the only way that our province has not yet had any cases of coronavirus is because there was a responsible attitude from each man and woman from catamarca
my great concern is for those who were and will be left out of the system the after it is like when the waters of a flood recede and for that we have to prepare now
the great strategists of history had one point in common they were several steps ahead which allowed them to better organize society in the face of events such as enemy attacks it is true that this pandemic was not expected by anyone but we do know what awaits us when this is over
that is why it is very important that as a society we begin to organize ourselves for that moment and not only for when the coronavirus pandemic passes but also for dengue which has also hit our province hard and does so with more intensity every year and which requires much more effective government policies to prevent and combat it
to begin with let is look at those who are experiencing employment problems today help them from giving them a place in a work space that may be available to any change or arrangement that is needed
we all need and deserve a decent job and each person who was left without a job whether for those who qualified for a subsidy or for those who did not requires everyone is help
union make force we need that strength more than ever
what is coming is challenging hopefully the government and each one of us rises to the occasion

for love and humanity flatout free  new hope box plus free justice offer combines for a  value with just  purchase  four years ago today  our president rolled out his campaign including the words likewise tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border no one with any sense of history has any doubts about who he was channeling four years ago many hoped this was not who he really was but just a cynical ploy to stand out in a crowded f  ield but if there were any doubts or feelings this was just an act on this the fourth anniversary of his launching his campaign with such cruel calculated words that doubt has long vanished each day as we learn more from the camps where asylum seekers are being separated from their children and concentrated in unhealthy living conditions the toll of his dehumanizing of others becomes more clear that so many republicans have simply embraced the motto of the first ladys i really dont care jacket is actually kind of heartbreaking two years ago we did a giveaway on this anniversary to bring attention to his nazistyle dehumanization of others just trying to find some way to bring attention to just how much more dangerous this president is to america and the offer was well received yes at least from the time of nixon on theres been a pretty open embrace of racism by the republican party but as truly horrible as racism is what this president is doing is something much worse to believe yourself better than others because of race is rotten to the core but to arrive at the point where you no longer see others as even human is where things go frighteningly wrong history shows again and again that unless we find a way to block the path the republicans are now on or turn them to another direction a whole lot of good decent innocent people are going to end up losing their lives we can quibble about do we now have actual concentration camps in america what is clear is that manymany republican voters are looking at camps where humans are facing intentionallycreated suffering and seeing no real problem with it if they are not objecting now will they object to the next step or the step after that hopefully we never find out a big part of what makes cooks so valuable is their ability to find the silver lining in every cloud those up to no good know the value in hopelessness over the years ive come to believe that what makes cooks so valuable is that no matter the message those up to no good are spreading cooks simply refuse to abandon all hope no matter what cooks embrace hope always have always will and when times reach their worst that hope makes all the difference but i have to admit for the last couple of years for these july th offers ive had a hard time creating the sense of hope that if we are going to live up to our voice of cooking trademark we always need to be able to find this year is different this year finally there actually is new hope though you dont see it brought up much these past few months the  election changed everything that was a good night in the vote totals we all found the proof we so needed that real america is still very much alive in the overwhelming rejection of republicans across the board including twelve million more votes for democratic senate candidates than republican ones the true story of america was shouted from the rooftops for all to hear the only reason this administration still holds the white house is because of the length of time between presidential elections america doesnt want him and of course there is no reason to trust this president and his republican supporters in congress and there is every reason to fear the hurt he will inflict in the time he has left so we must all work to minimize that hurt still come the night of  one of league of extraordinary candidates the democratic party is now fielding will take back the white house for the people of this nation as long as we dont lose hope as long as we get everyone we know to vote and as long as we stand together against the inhumanity that has captured the republican party the reality is the future is already certain lets all do all we can to keep hope alive at penzeys weve found that a good message travels far but a good message combined with a great offer with your sharing has no limits to its reach so for two days through sunday night  we are doing our best to shine a spotlight on the dangers of supporting this president while celebrating the decency and goodness of those his administration and the republican party seek to dehumanize with not one but two great offers the first is a flatout free in our stores  value new hope box online at penzeyscom to see all the goodness of the new hope box please click this link,1

" children are trapped in facilities as covid rages
monday is memorial day
on that solemn day we remember the countless men and women who lost their lives serving in the us armed forces to whom we owe a debt that can never be repaid
this memorial day our hearts will be particularly heavy as we find ourselves in the third month of this pandemic as the national death toll will soon breach  flags have been ordered to fly at halfstaff on all federal buildings
our thoughts linger on those front line heroes who put their lives at risk every day to save those severely sickened by covid particularly those who have died as a result of contracting the disease while healing others
and we can only offer our condolences to those who have lost parents and grand parents included in the tens of thousands of seniors in nursing homes across the country whose tragic deaths may have been prevented as reported this week had our government acted just one week sooner in the commonwealth where to date there have been  confirmed cases of covid  of those who died did so in congregate care
there is yet another group living in congregate care facilities weighing heavily on hearts in pennsylvania there are nearly  youths in detention facilities shelter care group homes etc as seniors are in nursing homes the staff and youth in these facilities are at grave risk trapped in accommodations poorly designed to survive a nationwide pandemic how long until there are confirmed fatalities
on april  the washingtonbased nonprofit the sentencing project reported that across the us  detained juveniles and  staff tested positive for covid
as of may  the numbers soared to  juveniles and  staff the sentencing project believes the real numbers are much higher due to the limited amount of testing
since the shutdown an indeterminant number of children have been released to protect their safety but certainly not enough to ensure that a temporary stay in state licensed or operated facilities does not end up being a death sentence for these young people
on april   the juvenile law center the youth sentencing reentry project and dla piper filed a king is bench petition before the supreme court of pennsylvania on behalf of all pennsylvania youth currently held in county detention centers or other correctionalresidential placements and on behalf of all youth charged as adults they asked the court for a review of every youth in custody and to provide for the immediate release of medically vulnerable youth as well as those who pose no immediate risk of harm to others
a large share of these youth are behind bars for minor offenses associated with probation violations including truancy curfew violations or other nonviolent probation transgressions
the pa supreme court denied their petition and prescribed a set of weaker provisions including reviewing the facilities discretionary review of individual juveniles as well as requiring judges to undertake efforts to limit the introduction of new youths into facilities for the duration of the pandemic
the toll that covid takes on children in delinquent care and their mental health and wellbeing is considerable as they are mostly isolated from seeing their families inperson and in some instances they are isolated from others in their placement facilities
in covid hotspot cities like new york and louisiana riots and escapes have been reported as fear and frustration boil over
for this memorial day we ask you to say a prayer and take action to protect these trapped children by posting the text of this newsletter on your social media and share it with your friends and family together we must call upon our local and state officials for the rapid review of every case of youth in congregate care with the goal of finding safer places for them to live lest our hearts break again in mourning the senseless death of even one

"let is start from companies
proposal to reduce the tari
companies are the engine of the economy and in ceccano there are many that have had to close due to covid
while the government is slow to give useful solutions to the economic recovery of the cities i try to respond to this climate of fear and uncertainty with concrete and easily implemented proposals
i therefore propose to reduce the tari for commercial activities and businesses that were unable to exercise from march to may
it is a measure of common sense as well as a little help to restart our fragile commercial fabric on the contrary it would seem to me true injustice to ask merchants to pay for waste they did not produce in a period when they had zero income
citizens should also benefit
i believe that a tariff subsidy should also be considered for economically disadvantaged households the community must not leave anyone behind only in this way we can start again

" rebellious communists from the experience lived during the epidemic sign a collective platform for a new branch of social protection concerning the abolition of unemployment by professional social security and call to sign the petition the petition below attached on changeorg
unsubmissive communists
professional social security is now
partial unemployment must be replaced by professional social security
the government has decided that it will no longer reimburse  of the wages of people on partial unemployment but only  except for the catering and hotel trades this decision can lead to a disaster hundreds of thousands of people risk losing their jobs
it is time to put in place a new right which guarantees the income of a person made unemployed until he is hired in a new job
the state replaced companies for two months to pay salaries this corresponded to both a social emergency and an economic requirement to avoid recession he must continue this assistance until a total resumption of activity
but it cannot replace salary payments on a longterm basis if we want to change the situation at this time of ecological and social crisis we must disconnect employment from capitalism or even emancipate employment from capital the proposal for a universal income which is put forward by social democracy is well below the stakes
this is why we propose the establishment of a new branch of social security professional security which makes it possible to ensure this income guarantee
more than ever this measure is essential covid  has highlighted the need for a reorientation of our economy modifying the production and consumption sectors creating new ones takes time probably ten years and to carry out this work it is necessary to secure the workers affected by these changes by giving themselves the adaptation time
the spirit of this professional social security proposal is in the common future program supported by jeanluc melenchon in the  presidential elections it has also been a pcf proposal for years
this is the very term of the cgt proposal
la france insoumise adds to this the proposal for an enforceable right to employment for each citizen which would require the state to maintain the remuneration of unemployed employees until they obtain of a new job
this measure must be financed by the pooling of social security contributions and by a tax on financial assets transferred to social security capital must contribute to this measure of job sustainability
if we want to create a new world the time has come to build this new human right professional social security is for us the emblematic measure that makes it possible to break with neoliberal policies solely concerned with the search for maximum profit in the short term whatever the ecological and social cost
the simultaneous experience of the epidemic and partial unemployment for  million employees creates a unique opportunity to change the way we conceive of our relationship to work
we can no longer produce and consume as before this requires major changes a new international division of labor planning of needs relocated production modified work chains and the establishment of new industrial and commercial sectors respectful of both people and our ecosystem
to achieve these changes we must break with the financial logic that leads companies to always seek lower costs that is to say the reduction of the wage bill and unemployment to maintain the possibility of paying dividends to shareholders and it takes time time to implement the necessary economic changes and the training plans defined with the employees to allow both to save existing knowledge and knowhow and to acquire new ones time for everyone to be educated and trained for the jobs of tomorrow including those in the energy and digital transitions this time only a social intervention guaranteeing the remunerations will make it possible to give it
and this measure will make it possible to release the energies as the president says but this time good energies those of the people because the other lesson we can draw from these two months of epidemic is the ability of employees citizens to think of new forms of production and exchange
let us think of this massive commitment to the manufacture of masks which made up for the shortcomings of the state and the selfishness of the distribution giants who stored them to sell them
let us think of the employees of the luxfer gerzat factory the only european producer of medical oxygen cylinders who resisted its closure and demanded its nationalization
let us think of the caregivers who collectively knew how to completely reorganize the public hospital scuttled by the liberal plans of successive governments in order to be able to manage the epidemic
let is think of all those who have been able to create short networks of relationships between producers and the population to feed themselves and most often differently and better
this is what it is all about freeing up energies directed towards the general interest because if we want to create a new world it is only possible by having it built by all those who will live there which means entrusting them with the appropriate forms of power in the company as well as in the city
the professional social security measure for all this new branch of social protection by placing people and not profit at the center of work by protecting family income is for us signatories an emergency to begin to put ourselves at the right level of response to the social ecological and democratic crisis
our ambition to renew the spirit of ambroise croizat and the cnr national resistance council for the st century time is running out for us
we invite you to join us in this goal by signing the attached petition on changeorg

"let is open a discussion on which economic policy for microenterprises as an alternative to the welfare policy proposed by the conte government and its majority
the motion by dario boilini presented to the committee of italian radicals in may  faces and tries to compete with the world of microenterprises in the new postpandemic covid economic reality
starting from the premise that the set of microenterprises suffers more than others the distortions of the country system in reference to bureaucracy and the difficulty of accessing credit and that the effects of the pandemic will have a potentially destructive impact on this area which represents  of italians who derive sustenance from their activity proposes a political initiative that goes to support microenterprises understood as that natural pool of professionals selfemployed workers vat numbers and companies with less than  employees a natural pool of subjects interested in liberal liberal and libertarian policies for the liberal revolution and for the united states of europe 
the merit of this proposal also represents its main limitation that is it groups and homogenizes very different economic subjects there are professionals both registered with professional associations and simple vat numbers and businesses and even among the latter a distinction should be made between manufacturing enterprises and service enterprises without forgetting the primary sector that is the agricultural sector where organized enterprises coexist with activities which on the other hand are distinguished by an individual character direct farmers
agriculture is perhaps the sector that has been least affected by the crisis with some exceptions
each of these subjects has specific peculiarities regarding the difficulties deriving from the long lockdown
manufacturing companies need liquidity to be able to invest in the raw materials or semifinished necessary for their production cycle and cover the depreciation of investments in structures and machinery in addition to personnel costs for which in case of need they can access the redundancy fund which as a rule is triggered by more than  employees but which in the current situation is also applied to companies with fewer employees
otherwise service companies have as their main cost that represented by the cost of employees but also in this case the redundancy fund has intervened
particular is the case of the professions among these we can distinguish between those enrolled in professional associations accountants lawyers doctors engineers surveyors architects commercial agents etc and those who do not have this characteristic among the latter the majority carry out disguised dependent work
we think of software programmers business brokers sales promoters etc these are probably the weakest subjects in today is reality
one of the aspects that distinguishes the discussion on economic issues is what type of intervention should be done considering that the financial capacity of the italian state characterized by a large debt is more limited than other european partners
assistancetype interventions subsidies or interventions aimed at increasing the investment capacity of companies strengthening their financial capacity
the choice depends on the economic prospects we have
the subsidy intervenes in a situation of difficulty in terms of immediate consumption
increasing the financial capacity of companies means creating the conditions for greater investment capacity and therefore for a faster economic recovery
however to be fair firms invest when the economic outlook is optimistic
the criticisms that have been brought to the latest government decree concern the benefits that are paid above all in terms of subsidies and therefore do not create the premises for a recovery criticisms made by the new president of confindustria bonomi by economists including tria and others by della vedova secretary of europe
we cannot fail to bear in mind what is a structural characteristic of most italian companies and of which the microenterprises area is the prototype the small size a substantial undercapitalization and a still too widespread prevalence of the family business which precludes to qualified external managerial entrances
all this generates an industrial structure in which investments in research development are lower than those of international competitors but it also produces another peculiarity the high birth of new businesses linked to an equally high mortality which causes damage to the economic system as a whole banks creditors employees etc
bearing in mind that medium and large companies are almost always the terminal of a production chain the fca with  thousand employees has an induction of  thousand employees the difficulties of small enterprises in adapting to new it and telematic systems create problems for them as now the logistics and the warehouse are managed in an automated way
another aspect that characterizes the economists discussion is whether the liquidity injections should be aimed at all companies or only those that have prospects for greater economic development
allocate resources to those who have survival as their sole objective or direct them towards those with greater development capacity who is able to identify the deserving ones
given that this discussion does not have the current government as its horizon which is characterized by a venezuelan model statism capable of even imposing the right state price on surgical masks with the result of making them unavailable in all italian pharmacies from north to south the good question remains also for a next political phase called to manage the severe economic and social crisis in the coming months with what criteria
last but not least the bureaucracy by now the business system is caged in a system of rules that discourages investments in almost all economic activities be it the small shop or the large business
authorizations and permits are subject to a myriad of initiatives that intersect in such a way as to create difficulties that are difficult to overcome the story of the reconstruction of the morandi bridge which collapsed in august  in genoa and today after only  months rebuilt in defiance of the italian legal jungle should be the guiding star with which to address the discussion and political proposals for to debureaucratize and relaunch the italian economy
keeping in mind that obstacles are always present even in the procedures of public offices
when the practice provides that the applications are subject to visas authorizations and or permits from different administrations it is almost certain that the procedure will meet biblical times
often the request is rebuffed from one institution to another due to the lack of documents required by the legislation even if substantially superfluous furthermore the lack of dialogue skills between the it systems of the various administrations when they are present obliges the sending of paper documents with further delay
in all this it should be remembered that in our criminal code there is a crime abuse of office art  cp
today the procedures are managed by the managers and not by the mayors who only have a political power the fear of incurring in this type of crime which has recently seen a worsening of the sentence from  to  years generates an attitude that to say prudent is euphemistic in the management of the procedures
today is the time to open a nonideological discussion and promote a courageous political initiative with proposals for real simplification and debureaucratization this is the real save italy capable of producing economic and social development as an alternative to the current venezuelan antiindustrial majority

"every one of the democratic candidates remaining would make a better president than donald trump but the race for the democratic nomination is a fractured one it is not a straightforward narrative captured by glancing at a map and the process wont be decided by the simple horse race numbers in clickbait headlines that is never been our focus our focus is on building a broad coalition to win delegates everywhere
for months elizabeth has been near or at the top of the list of candidates that voters are considering for president according to the latest economistyougov poll  of voters across all age groups are considering voting for warren including  of selfdescribed liberals and  of selfdescribed moderates elizabeth is best positioned to unite the party and lead the democratic ticket to defeat donald trump
our campaign is no stranger to being written off or counted out early but here is what we do know elizabeth has proven the doubters wrong before
elizabeth is progressive effective and has lived a life that has prepared her for this fight with a strong organization of more than  staff on the ground in  states bolstered by a movement of more than  grassroots donors we are confident that as americans continue to get to know elizabeth theyll see what we see every day elizabeth is the only candidate who can unite the party and defeat donald trump in november
but the only way well win this nomination is if everyone reading this digs deep and funds our  grassrootsfunded campaign can you help us keep moving forward chip in   or whatever you can to power this movement through the critical races to come",1

mcconnell to pelosi we dont need no stinkin impeachment us senate majority leader mitch mcconnell rky delivered the following remarks december  on the senate floor regarding impeachment now of course there is the matter of the articles of impeachment themselves in a highly unusual step the speaker of the house continues to hem and haw about whether and when she intends to take the normal next step and transmit the houses accusations to the senate some house democrats imply they are withholding the articles for some kind of leverage so they can dictate the senate process to senators i admit im not sure what leverage there is in refraining from sending us something we do not want meanwhile other house democrats seem to be suggesting theyd prefer never to transmit the articles and the speaker of the house herself has been unclear on this her message has been somewhat muddled so we have this fascinating situation where following house democrats rush to impeachment following weeks of pronouncements about the urgency of this situation the prosecutors have now developed cold feet the house democrat prosecution seem to have gotten cold feet and to be unsure whether they even want to proceed to a trial like i said  a pretty unusual spectacle and in my view not one that reflects well on the house so well continue to see how this develops and whether the house democrats ever work up the courage to take their accusations to trial but let me close with this i am proud the senate came together today to confirm more wellqualified nominees and pass major legislation for the american people i wish all my colleagues a merry christmas happy holidays and a joyous new year i hope everyone enjoys this important time with our families and loved ones well see you in,1

can i really lower taxes i got an excellent question via messenger and thought it was worth sharing the question called me out on my assertion that i will work to lower taxes and asked what i will do to replace the tax revenue i welcome questions like this because they directly relate to my platform there are two sides to the equation while i do have ideas about alternative methods of increasing revenue the side i will concentrate on immediately is the expense side  if you saw any of the interviews or debates you know that i illustrated over  million in waste from one year if you did not see those i encourage you to go to dedhamsolutionscom and click the media coverage link my platform has always been about lower taxes transparency and accountability these three concepts are intricately connected without transparency there is a huge potential for the lack of accountability and vice versa without accountability who is going to ensure transparency without both the potential for waste increases as has been the case in dedham we can reduce revenue on the tax side if we eliminate waste on the expense side reducing revenue on the tax side means lower taxes on the subjects of accountability and transparency the problem is not just a local problem our state treasury has suffered from the lack of both as well in the last  years we have experienced the largest theft of public funds in the history of the commonwealth over  million walked out the door in employees briefcases and using fraudulent checks we have also experienced a slow and significant slide in fiscal health which has resulted in massachusetts being ranked  out of  states in terms of fiscal health think about that there are some fairly poor states but  out of  of them are rated fiscally healthier than massachusetts the reasons excessive debt and low reserves  the same exact things that will haunt dedham soon if we do not address them i have backed up everything i have said with facts i think i have earned the right to say trust me there are ways to reduce taxes in dedham i have every intention of achieving lower taxes to be clear i have every intention of achieving lower taxes not just a lower tax rate vote for me on april  then watch what happens,1

lets declare war on israel from the title of this article i surmise your thoughts are that i am muslim i am an arab sympathizer i am antisemitic i am crazy or that i am all of these things however i am not one of them instead i am a christian and a nd generation american who grew up believing that the united states is the greatest nation in the world this is what i grew up believing but today i no longer think this is true in order for a nation to be great  two things are necessary it must provide a viable and good life for most of its citizens and it must be a positive leader on the world stage standing up for truth justice and the rule of law among nations it is the latter that i presently have problems with from my perspective the united states has become a rogue nation that lies to the world lies to its citizens and has grievously trampled the rule of law between nations my sincere belief is that we have become this way because of our irrational support of the nation of israel complicating any discussion about jewish political issues is the holocaust where six million jews died horrible deaths at the hands of adolph hitler and his nazis surely something had to be done for a group of people who so grievously and wrongfully suffered in  great brittan helped create the nation of israel most people at the time thought this was the right thing to do and indeed most still feel this way today however the truth is that creation of the nation of israel was a blunder that has kept the world at war for the past  years with no end in sight to the carnage and destruction stop and think about this for the first time in the history of the world a coalition of world governments agreed to establish a homeland for the jews in a land occupied by mostly arab peoples a land that was fought over by european powers against the arab world during the crusades for almost  years in light of this reality didnt anyone think how the arab people would feel about this decision when it was being considered apparently not at the time the allies were swimming in the euphoria of their victory over the axis powers and could care less about what the arabs thought or felt the truth is that while creation of the nation of israel was a great victory and joy to the jews it was a defeat and an insulting affront to the arabs however the situation is much more complicated than this because of how this affected the palestinian people the palestinian people were a majority in palestine and the jews lived and worked beside them in peace for centuries this changed in  suddenly with british assistance jews began immigrating to palestine in droves became the majority and formed their own government and guess what because the jews believed they are gods chosen people living under this new government were two classes of people citizens who were jews and everybody else this is exactly the same situation that jews lived with in nazi germany under hitler and blacks lived with in south africa under the afrikaners furthermore the israeli doctrine of the right of return forced palestinians to surrender their homes and the lands they occupied for centuries to newly immigrated jews who never lived in israel before the situation just described is the crux of the problem that has driven the arab israeli conflict and world terrorism for the past  years the jews believe that they have a god given right to palestine and have displaced palestinians who have lived in the area for generations the jews base their claims upon the torah and the palestinian claims are based upon a longstanding right of ownership for reasons which to say the least are convoluted the united states has taken up the israeli cause against the arabs this turned into a tragedy after  years of fighting and war there is no end in sight to the destruction suffering and carnage carefully think about this the united states is the most powerful and militarily advanced nation in the world no other nation can stand up to our military superiority with this great power comes great responsibility a responsibility to promote justice in the world and peace among nations every living american should know and understand that this is our greatest responsibility however the truth is that in this we have failed we have failed because for the past  years we have fought wars not in the interest of peace and justice but instead to further the interests of zionism and the injustices associated with this wrongful and backward political philosophy we stood up against slavers hitler and the afrikaners because of their belief that they were better than everyone else so why are we today supporting a group of people who are guilty of this same injustice especially when these people have assumed the right to take for their own homes and land that does not belong to them what is zionism it is the belief that the jews are the chosen people of god and as such should have a nation of their own in the land god gifted to their forebears the jews in the old testament of the bible the problem is that the united states is fighting wars to support these ends unfortunately in order to win these wars the arab people must be forced to accept that palestine is no longer theirs that the piece of dirt called the holy land is now the property of israel and that they must demonstrate they are good people by accepting what israel and the united states is forcing upon them the truth is that every arab we kill because they are a terrorist is a person fighting for their honor and the homes and lands that rightfully belong to the palestinian people in other words we are killing people fighting for the same ideals that americans fought for in our revolutionary war the united states and israel is the invading army not the arabs this being true how is it possible for america to claim the high ground in this conflict how is it possible for americans to believe that the best way to bring peace and justice into this world is by forcing the arab world to accept injustice lets declare war on israel when we do and israel sues for peace as they surly will as a condition of peace we should demand that israel disavows their doctrine of jewish superiority and the racist doctrine of the jewish right of return also we should demand that israel grants equal citizenship to all its citizens including the palestinians in america we subscribe to the notions of freedom of and freedom from religion this being the case it is absurd that we are fighting to establish a religious state where equality under the law does not exist what is worse through our unholy alliance with israel we are forcing the other nations of the world into accepting what is best described as a rogue nation among the community of nations the america i love and served should be a force for peace and justice in the world unfortunately this is not the case america has become a tyrant ruling the world by subterfuge

one of my favorite scriptures is galatians  describing the fruit of the spirit these two verses are by far the fastest way to gauge our relationship with god there is it is a tool that keeps us real about who we are and who we are following lets keep the end in mind love god with all your heart mind and soul love your neighbor as yourself with jesus life death and resurrection there came a new covenant we no longer had the law to go through with all of the blood sacrifices and atonement jesus was the complete sacrifice and atonement for our sins and there are now were only the two commands they are worth repeating love god with all your heart mind and soul love your neighbor as yourself this sounds so simple it is not to love god with all your heart mind and soul is not a sunday afternoon stroll through the church as we tick the box the all your anything means with all your intentional focus this is not a hobby to love god with all your heart mind and soul is a total commitment not a contribution if we pursue a relationship with god where we love him with all of our heart mind and soul that makes him the first thought not an afterthought it means that when we wake up he is the first thing we think about we spend time in his word with a fervent deliberate focus on getting to know him more we would think about him and his view on the things in our lives and circumstances we face we would want his input we would be careful to treat him with respect dignity and careful consideration we would be certain to always remain faithful and avoid anything that would threaten our relationship with him we would want our actions to bring him joy and not discomfiture or sadness  that is what passionate love is when we love god with passionate intentionality we can then love our neighbor as ourselves the way god loves us this leads us to the fruit of the spirit it is with these same attributes listed in the fruit of the spirit that god himself demonstrates his love for us paul presents the fruit of the spirit here in galatians but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace forbearance kindness goodness faithfulness gentleness and selfcontrol against such things there is no law galatians  niv but the fruit produce bounty harvest of the gods spirit disposition temperament attitude nature are the characteristics of god which he has demonstrated to all of mankind and the way in which he did so in essence these are the result of his love evidenced with his son and holy spirit love in this context is a verb paul describes it this way love is patient love

time with him read his word they become evident in our lives they become the filter with which we view and act in our everyday encounters and activities we back up and balk we cant possibly attain all of these virtues in our lives it is too much why should we even start there is truth in that statement and alone we cannot attain these virtues that is where jesus and the holy spirit come in jesus gave us an example of how to have these virtues in the midst of extreme turmoil challenges pain and sorrow he spent time with his father regularly and often he depended on the holy spirit for strength and grace when jesus was being baptized he came up out of the water and the spirit settled on him became a part of who he was  there are times that our circumstances overwhelm us we feel like there is nothing left in us to love to give or to go farther often we dont see ourselves slipping when we drift from god being the focus of our love and we become selfcentered in our love when its all about me then we start to slip when the feeling is i deserve this i want what they have i need more of im entitled to that ive had enough we all know the list it is filled with inow is when we need to pull out the fruit of the spirit the barometer of our relationship to god and see what needs to change this is when god steps in and gives us all we need to go on to succeed to get up to give out to love more with a grace we cannot imagine today can we make a list of the fruit of the spirit with their definitions and put them in a place we can see them easily is it time to take paper and pen settle in on our own inventory just god and us can we just hit the pause button in our lives and consider who the focus of our love really is and then adjust,1

"from today we have reopened our large garden to the boys and girls of the mount of olives
for almost three months the boys and girls of riesi like their peers throughout italy were forced home
there has been little or no talk of them of boys and girls throughout the pandemic and up to now
little because the priorities as often happens were other and childhood as often happens is never a priority for both public and private institutions
bad because the times when boys and girls were remembered they were portrayed as vectors of covid therefore a vehicle of death for their grandparents and for others
for three months in each of these very long days we have had no peace
we did not give up in front of the narrative that claimed that schools parks spaces dedicated to children had become the most dangerous places in the world
the schools the parks that had not contributed to the outbreak of the infection were closed and for long days and weeks there was talk of something else
the meaning or rather the common sense of words has been lost for some time and security has become synonymous with fear
thanks to a reasoned articulated and serious order the mayor of riesi wanted to restore hope to the boys and girls of riesi
within the law the provisions envisaged for containing and combating the spread of the pandemic and also in the awareness that it is no longer possible to unload the anxiety and fears we have tried and feel on boys and girls
in compliance with these measures as well as the provisions of the law as well as common sense we were able to listen to the shouting of the boys and girls along the avenues the gardens the outdoor areas
in the next few days we will continue with the program of structured activities outdoor education as we say now and what else will be possible to restore broken sociality to the smallest citizens
in the meantime since last september we have already experienced the minute hours as well as for more than  years outdoor teaching sport and music theater and poetry as disciplines on which we have never backed down even as much as the ministerial programs and the huge and often illogical bureaucracy was imposed relentlessly
of course now we have to rebuild three months of social desolation and we need the help of everyone and everyone of anyone who can and will
the monte degli ulivi village makes sense as a village for boys and girls a place for those who know how to look beyond the present time do not let themselves be imprisoned by anxieties and fear because while trying them they are aware that there is also much more in the world",1

contending for the faith beloved while i was very diligent to write to you concerning our common salvation i found it necessary to write to you exhorting you to contend earnestly for the faith which was once for all delivered to the saints jude  nkjv for those of you who have not notice we are in the last days we are fulfilling matthew  kjv which says and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that ye be not troubled for all these things must come  to pass but the end is not yet we seek a sign i know many of you are saying i have heard this all before true but the key is that it is getting worse so we seek a sign as did the churches before us and as he sat upon the mount of olives the disciples came unto him privately saying tell us when shall these things be and what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world yet here is where many of us have fallen verse  and jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you false christ among us verse  for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many my friend this has not only happened but this is happing all around us all these are the beginning of sorrows we have been fighting in the middle east for over  years and war with iran now looms ahead in our not too distant future verse  and  says and ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that ye be not troubled for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet for nation shall rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in divers places hold on that is just the beginning of sorrows you have not seen nothing yet god is word seed god is word is a seed as we learned in luke  the seed is the word of god therefore god is word is alive as we see in  peter  nkj  having been born again not of corruptible seed but incorruptible through the word of god which lives and abides forever with this in mind we need no new revelations but we need christ inspiration in our hearts maintain your life with god dont be troubled the lord jesus is here just call on him and maintain your faith in him jude  says but you beloved building yourselves up on your most holy faith praying in the holy spirit keep yourselves in the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life and on some have compassion making a distinction but others save with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garment defiled by the flesh apostates predicted jude  says  these are grumblers complainers walking according to their own lusts and they mouth great swelling words flattering people to gain advantage but you beloved remember the words which were spoken before by the apostles of our lord jesus christ how they told you that there would be mockers in the last time who would walk according to their own ungodly lusts these are sensual persons who cause divisions not having the spirit you have been told that these apostates were predicted to be here we should not be surprised but yet we are many of us have woken up in sheer unbelief that we to were caught up in a lie they cause division how they cause division among us because they have a spirit but not the spirit these apostates mouth great swelling words flattering people to gain advantage frankly they can genuinely be aweinspiring  until you look a little deeper at their message glory to god their aim is to replace your universal love and faith in the lord jesus christ with another love jude  says now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy to god our savior who alone is wise be glory and majesty dominion and power both now and forever amen yes the lord can keep you without any help from them or their message but that fact will be hidden from you for they seek to replace your savior with their own false messiah what are false teachings and religions matthew  says and many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many you have been warned timothy  says now the spirit speaketh expressly that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils speaking lies in hypocrisy having their conscience seared with a hot iron i pray for you who have fallen prey to false teachings and religions and dont even know it paul in galatians  niv goes further and says but even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a gospel other than the one we preached to you let them be under gods curse there is no excuse trying all things even if someone is led by an angel even an angel but you say what if there arise up a great prophet and holy man who has signs and wonders following him shall we believe everything he or she says regardless of our sacred scripture and support them deuteronomy  clearly says if there arises among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and he gives you a sign or a wonder and the sign or the wonder comes to pass of which he spoke to you saying let us go after other godswhich you have not knownand let us serve them you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams for the lord your god is testing you to know whether you love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul you shall walk after the lord your god and fear him and keep his commandments and obey his voice you shall serve him and hold fast to him but you say we follow christ no you follow christ in name only you follow a false christ and his message and dont even know it john  nkj says it is the spirit who gives life the flesh profits nothing the words that i speak to you are spirit and they are life our lord and savior jesus christ told us that his words are alive therefore they contain life your bible may look lifeless and powerless but so does a seeds until you put it in the ground then as we water the word with song and prayer the life and power of christ rise up in us next in romans  nkj we learn that  for with the heart one believes to righteousness and with the mouth confession is made to salvation what more do we need yet many of us have fallen to the seducing words of false teachers how is that possible let us now learn how god will challenge your faith we are plainly warned that in our day there will be an increase of these false religions which have departed from the simple truth and faith in our lord jesus christ they will seduce many sincere christians and nonchristians into following their false doctrines and manmade traditions these teaching have nothing to do with your salvation and they are based on old testament scriptures and works they will twist the bible the truth about god and his servants simply put these false teachings and false religions will swallow up many souls to identify a false religion doctrines teachers preachers cults and prophets look for a restrictive system of religious beliefs and rites that disregards the freedom of your christian liberty  corinthians  niv tells us what liberty we truly have it says now the lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is freedom this will not be so in the cults or false religions many of the cults treat their women as second class citizens the focus in many of the sects will be on the women the cult or group will most likely have a charismatic leader who was the only real authority for the believers and he will have a god complex generally this god complex is an unwavering belief in himself which is characterized by an unswerving inflated feeling of the leaders personal abilities his privilege and his infallibility he cannot be questioned to do so will bring damnation to your soul if mistakes can be found of the great leader the followers will find every excuse they can to hide or overlook his failures so look for the visionary types like jim jones or father divine they will speak of themselves as being closer to god then you are or closer to a messenger angel this holy man will have a great devotion from his followers that even his very words will replace christ words if you were to ask them what must i do to have eternal life they will tell you there is no salvation in jesus christ without their program path message or way for them their message is the very revelation of jesus christ therefore the bible along is no enough it is the bible  plus they will tell you that you must believe their program path messenger or way all else will burn they will neglect to advise you of john  kjv which says and i give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father is hand i and my father are one instead of spreading eternal security in christ jesus they spread fear protection for them lies behind their gates and their gates alone their gates are their doctrines through their gates the chosen enters and never leaves only begotten son they will neglect to tell you of john  kjv which says for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for them salvation is not so simple  in fact it is rather complicated there are very few of their own followers who know precisely what they have to do they will say receive our message however their message could be  to a thousands books and recordings of their holy one speaking further they most likely have divisions among them these will manifest as mini separate camps and clich��s those outside their particular camp are also damned serpent seed or simply foolish virgins works and law their focus is on the outward man and your works not the soul their creed is submission however colossians  kjv tells us not to focus on touch not taste not handle not which all are to perish with the using after the commandments and doctrines of men which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in will worship and humility and neglecting of the body not in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh their belief system is holier than all others they seemly forget romans  esv which says as for the one who is weak in faith welcome him but not to quarrel over opinions one person believes he may eat anything while the weak person eats only vegetables let not the one who eats despise the one who abstains and let not the one who abstains pass judgment on the one who eats for god has welcomed him who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another it is before his own master that he stands or falls and he will be upheld for the lord is able to make him stand one person esteems one day as better than another while another esteems all days alike each one should be fully convinced in his own mind  they know their founder and spiritual leaders speak otherwise they will even deny the holy spirit for his original spoken word revelation which is only for a few to reject his message is to reject their christ for what he teaches is genuinely another christ they will tell you to forget about what is written in the bible and follow the written or verbal teaching of their great one in other words leave christ and follow the master the prophet or the holy man instead still  corinthians  kjv tells us while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal trapped in a lie the people are bound by a strong influence from the religious teachings of their group these groups have extreme doctrines which make it very difficult for a group or cult member to leave these groups share a common theme they all in some way or fashion deny the fact that salvation comes through faith in jesus christ alone its jesus plus their great messengers words they can be very clear about this and are therefore easier to recognize they will hand out a book video or a cd of their great leader rather than of jesus christ which their messengers words have replaced they will hand out a book of rules from their dear leader concerning the length of your hair dress and open or closedtoe shoes this instead of reaching the lost they make you a more twofold prisoner of hell they may seem to believe almost the same as a true christian in christ but if you look closer you will see that their teachings are in fact quite different from what jesus christ says and are more aligned to their living christ messengers words for their day they are not taught and do not know the real word of god  they are pseudochristians closeted group they are a small minority in our community yet these groups or cults appear to offer something that the true bible believers dont have basically they entangle individuals in two ways the first step can appeal to our pride as human beings by promising us a part of a private group with a special message and calling that others just dont have they can show us signs and wonders performed by their great leaders regardless of his failure rate they lead us back to the old testament and place us back under the law that is where we lose our christian liberties they give us their unsound modern doctrines which warrant us to a hidden revelation therefore as we follow the great leader and the local husband pastor we can become someone important or the chosen bride while others are only the bride helpers left out of the heavenly city these groups provide advanced and undisclosed knowledge that will make the followers unique once they accept the leader is message given them special powers beyond the usual christian capabilities this allows them to take the token and apply it to their lost and unsaved loved ones this is done without ever sharing the gospel with them they no longer need the gospel of jesus christ they have the message spoken by their holy healer and prophet  who has done more excellent works then even then christ they offer up superstitions and beliefs of their messenger which they call faith i believe even if you are saved you can to fall into these traps however trust in the lord jesus christ with all your heart and all your soul and he will lead you out with his written word and his holy ghost apostates depraved and doomed preach witness or evangelize the true written word of god and believe if you do so you will see the fulfillment of jude  which says these are spots in your love feasts while they feast with you without fear serving only themselves they are clouds without water carried about by the winds late autumn trees without fruit twice dead pulled up by the roots raging waves of the sea foaming up their own shame wandering stars for whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever now enoch the seventh from adam prophesied about these men also saying behold the lord comes with ten thousands of his saints to execute judgment on all to convict all who are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed in an ungodly way and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him i will leave you with galatians  which says i marvel that you are turning away so soon from him who called you in the grace of christ to a different gospel which is not another but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of christ but even if we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you let him be accursed as we have said before so now i say again if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received let him be accursed turn back to christ and christ alone shalom,1

the resumption of medical activity in wards with unique medical specializations in the county is vital for the health of the people of suceava
it is an additional proof that through the reaction unit of the medical staff from all the medical units in the county from the ambulance from isu dsp the prefect is institution and through the involvement of the suceava county council management a long awaited thing is done citizens
and we must not forget in any case those who work in local administrations led by mayors who have done more than their duty in their actions of monitoring and supporting people in solitary confinement or quarantine at home or in designated quarantine units in actions to support the elderly etc
it may sound trivial now but given the magnitude of the effects of the pandemic in our county without the voluntary compliance of the vast majority of the population it would have been extremely difficult if not impossible to stop the exponential spread of the virus in such a short time
leaving aside the miserable media campaigns launched against bukovina against suceava and the people of suceava especially in the online environment but also in a large part of the central press we cannot forget the cynical attempts of some of the local politicians to on our suffering for all for political and electoral interests shame on them and god forgive them
there were three main stages of the return to normal after the peak of the pandemic lifting traffic restrictions in suceava quarantining the  localities and now resuming medical activity at the county hospital
let us briefly recall the film of events
on april  the management of the county administration returned from convalescence after hospitalization caused by infection with the new coronavirus sarscov
several intense and coordinated actions of the institutions with responsibilities for managing the effects of the pandemic followed
on may  at  pm following the request made by the county council management the road and pedestrian traffic was opened in the area of the county hospital
this decision was taken by the county committee for emergency situations after consulting the views on this issue submitted by the suceava public health directorate and the suceava county emergency hospital
after the consultations organized at the county council with the mayors of the  quarantined localities and following their reasoned requests after the confirmations of dsp and cjsu the president of the suceava county council supported the proposal to lift the quarantine

well everyone  first a good and blessed day to all  i was not going to address this issue today but i feel from what i see going on around us  its time  i also do not like to get into politics because i feel dealing with the salvation of our souls and god to be way more important  but  from what i see and hear daily on almost all the media as well as us  the people of this country it makes me sad and mad i have to believe it is doing the same to god  to bea  r false witness is a evil sin there are sins worse but not many and anyone involved in this is not only promoting evil but also committing it  i see people making up lies about not only the person they are after but anyone around them or associated with them its one thing to make a honest mistake and correct ourselves when we learn the facts but i do not see this as the fact of the situation i see the media  the politicians and even the people of this country plain bearing false witness on purpose to create havoc and to destroy other individuals reputation  this is hate and evil fellow christians and folks  when you hear the statement that evil exists because good people do nothing to stop it  well here is a perfect example of the truth of that statement  honestly i think most of the people have totally turned their back on honesty and one of god is commandments  this is a bad thing folks  and i feel god has to be looking at it in the same way from what he teaches on the subject of bearing false witness and lying in general in general i despise politicians but i was brought up to not say anything if i did not have anything good to say  so i do not have much to say about them  but  we are told to to pray for them and i do this we all know that we are talking about president trump and his family as well as those associated with him im old enough to have lived through many presidents and i must admit that i did not really like many  but  it never even occurred to me to lie about them or bear false witness to ruin their reputation  many christians just as myself try to stay out of politics but none of us should stand by as we watch this happening around us it amazes me that you can fire and get rid of about anyone else in this world of ours for lying and being deceitful but politicians  they can lie and deceive and nothing is done  they tell us we can vote them out when their term ends but thats about it anyway  please do as god tells us  do not believe what you hear until you make sure its the truth  do not bear false witness about anyone and if you know of someone doing this try to correct them in a christian way anyway again  i noticed i have not smiled once yet since my welcome and thats because it saddens me to write this bearing false witness really bothers me and it must god also if he had it as one of his  commandments time to end this and with a happy note jesus will be back one day and all these problems will be gone  god bless  take care,1

if we do not fully trust god it is no fault of his the fault is our own we do not fully know god if we do not fully trust god our trust is a choice not a feeling the entire essence of christianity is faith and the essence of faith is trust it is constant and alive it may expand and contract at times but saving trust in christs work must be present to be a christian this is more simple and palatable it is eternal but when we faced with trusting him with the areas o  f our lives here on earth that matter to us most we fight we hide we fret we cannot let go the risk is too great i can trust god with my soul that will die that is in an unknown future in an unknown territory but to trust god in familiar territory on my own turf with those things i have possessed prior to my salvation is like being asked to jump from an airplane with no parachute its suicide so youre asking me to give up control over those things god has given me yes he gives and takes away and we still praise him though he takes every valuable thing from us on this earth god wants himself to be your only worship he wants your heart fixed on him and every relationship every possession to be an extension of your love for him so no longer do your kids matter because of how they make you feel nor so you care about their worldly success their education their success their marrying and raising kids your primary concern becomes god making them alive in christ and using them to build his kingdom if they marry and have kids it is to build his kingdom if they are single it is to build his kingdom if they are successful or poor it is used to build his kingdom nothing in this world matters only god the gospel and his kingdom it is a gracious gift to be purged of worldly desires it is a special privilege to be given a heart whos deepest craving and highest ambition is knowing god and him in others but it comes with great pain it is mostly forged in the heat of adversity where god purges our vain desires so that the gem of desire for him is all that is left none of us will trust perfectly nor love perfectly but we can all grow and so grow in our contribution to other souls god does not tell us to have faith when we feel it nor does he say to feel loving affection for people but he says to show them love by our words and by our deeds this requires a cultivation of our heart toward them but most often you will find that when we exert our will our heart follows the same is true of trust we can be scared to trust we can feel fear but we choose to trust and obey and as we do he will prove himself trustworthy but he may test us god wants committed worshipers but trust him we must does he promise to keep us from worldly danger and heartache nope but he does promise to be with us through it we must not reduce this trust to him giving us what we want or to keeping us happy and prosperous our faith will fail if that is our foundation but if our trust is based on the promises he has made in his word he will show that he can be trusted absolutely we must discover what our heart clings to the most it will keep us from trusting him the deepest only when we give to him those things which we value most does our faith become greater to the extent that we give those things to him will we trust him implicitly to guard them he often gives us back the ability and energy to steward them for his glory this requires that we align our desires with his then we will have a rare faith that will accomplish more good in the next world than  million people of nominal faith faith is trust and trust is hard great faith is great trust and great trust can feel impossible but whats impossible with man is possible with god he will supply every need and the ability to obey his commands we can trust him to help us trust him when our faith is weak tell him and ask him as his disciples asked lord increase our faith or as the man whose son jesus healed lord i believe help my unbelief god is looking for those who are willing to trust him greatly and give up every gain this world can bring for the gain of others enteral security this is the man or woman god uses greatly as his word and history have shown us it will bring us infinitely greater gain than any rubbish this world can give the world and people will fail you love them anyway trust him and obey him anything else is vanity and will accomplish nothing but your own misery jesus will never fail you you will find your life on the other side of devotion to him,1

when plastic invites itself into the depths of the sea
since march the daily lives of quebec citizens have changed in many ways with covid having something to do with it many social and environmental issues have been neglected at least temporarily far be it from me to trivialize the pandemic because it is indeed an unprecedented context for each of us a context that forces us to adapt however it is clear that ecological and ecoresponsible habits have been relegated to a lower rank to avoid the risk of contamination plastic and overpackaging have resurfaced more present than ever in these troubled times the singleuse plastic that we were so desperate to annihilate is now back on the shelves of supermarkets and small retailers the consequences linked to its consumption for marine ecosystems are not new however since already in january  alexandre shields published an article in le devoir in which he explained that if the trend continues with regard to the use of plastic there may well be more plastic than fish in the oceans by  plastic pollution is one of the most serious threats facing ocean ecosystems but unfortunately its consequences are not well understood by the citizens as a result this problem is constantly being swept under the rug
since the announcement of the pandemic confinement deconfinement the wearing of the compulsory mask things have happened around the world life has not completely stopped which is why i decided to dig up a study dating from last may which unfortunately went unnoticed when it was published and which nevertheless deserves our attention the magazine science published the results obtained by european researchers who analyzed the impacts of ocean currents on the circulation of plastic particles that end up in the sediments of marine environments these same researchers have thus discovered that the currents of the depths of the seas and oceans very often concentrate the microplastic in certain places this accumulation has the effect of creating the equivalent of plastic continents but these are now found in the seabed the study shows that each year more than  million tonnes of plastic are dumped into the seas and oceans of the planet once plastic particles find their way to the deep sea they can persist for thousands of years
each of us will certainly remember when in the early s oceanographer charles moore discovered the plastic continent of the pacific located between hawaii and california at present there are eight of these continents of waste that concentrate millions of tons of plastic transported by ocean currents according to scientists this pollution that accumulates on the surface of the water constitutes only  of all marine pollution this leaves  of plastic particles and detritus that end up in the depths of the sea and which as a result can be ingested by fish and other marine organisms who confuse these particles with their food this problem is not recent in  a study published in the journal nature communications explained that the world is rivers transport more than two million tons of plastic to the oceans each year the study published in science magazine reaffirms the need for policies if we are to limit the concentration of plastic in natural environments and minimize the impacts on marine ecosystems
quebec meanwhile is not spared by this contamination from plastics researchers from mcgill university have also conducted a study on the section of the st lawrence river located between quebec and montreal and they come to the conclusion that the st lawrence would be among the worst rivers on the planet regarding microplastic pollution the researchers mention concentrations that can reach several hundred particles for one kilogram of sediment prior to the pandemic calls to reduce plastic use were common but global plastic production continues to grow in the current context fear of contamination has reintroduced singleuse plastic packaging with some businesses going so far as to ban reusable packaging and containers the demand for plastic has recently increased which is bound to have terrible repercussions on marine ecosystems
health security is important even essential but we also have a duty as citizens to be aware of the consequences of our actions reducing plastic production is the only viable solution if we wish to restrict and control pollution on the high seas it is high time to realize that the problem of waste management in the sea has consequences as important as pollution on the ground it is imperative to conduct more studies on the ecological impacts of plastic particle pollution in the deep sea but it is also essential that every citizen weighs and weighs the weight of their daily actions there is always a way to opt for sustainable and responsible consumption habits that do not jeopardize deep waters and the flora and fauna they contain",1

last day   for  worth of who we are please take notice of the way america this weekend took notice of the life of senator john mccain as the reality of what the republican party has become gets exposed through our court system in the coming months there will be the question of can the party even survive and should it even survive in the months to come it will become clear that all those elected leaders who supported enabled and obstructed for this administ  ration have to go some of them to jail but what then the partys futures uncertain but in its past there is a roadmap to a place where it was possible to be conservative without working hand in hand with our nations adversaries to undermine americas values today the republican party is undeniably the party of racism environmental destruction and of taking health care from those in need all to funnel the nations wealth to the partys already wealthy benefactors what actually caused the republican party to rise up were values the very opposite of those it exhibits today there once was abraham lincoln fighting for the republican partys founding principle that slavery was an abomination there once was teddy roosevelt fighting to make environmental conservation the bedrock of this nation and too there once was john mccain who among his many battles successfully fought to make the americans with disabilities act ada the law of the land from now until november  we all must do all we can to save our country from what the republican party has become but come november  the struggle will still be far from over unraveling what unlimited political spending has done to our country is the battle of our time as much as  must be our main focus we are cooks we have proven we can multitask as we all sit down to dinner tonight its time again to start thinking of the way forward as their ronald reagan said in his farewell address let me offer lesson number one about america all great change in america begins at the dinner table it is time again for great change we werent planning for this but with the addition of the two cups of arizona dreaming in honor of the spirit of senator mccain today became a pretty good day to visit one of our stores or spend some time with us online at penzeyscom through midnight pacific today sunday  spend  on the spicesseasonings of your choice and receive  worth of arizona dreaming and really good french thyme if you spend that  on a teachers giftembrace hope combo and one each of the  pico fruta and powdered ginger you will end up with a total  value for just  to see arizona dreaming click this link,1

"risk of contagion in public toilets also by air why is it not discussed the research project of the university of foggia must be considered as soon as possible
by air for minutes in the bathrooms you can get infected by inhaling the virus why dont we talk about it
who doesnt regularly go to a public bathroom why are not we discussing specific measures
the hectic everyday life before the start of the lockdown led us to spend most of the day away from home and the use of public toilets in the office at the university at the bar rather than in the station on the train in a restaurant or at the cinema it was an almost obligatory stop then everything stopped suddenly and only now that it is gradually returning to normality great attention is paid to the use of common areas to avoid contagion opportunities but public toilets are not mentioned specific protocols and measures are not provided ad hoc yet their use will have to be revised and redesigned
we must not forget that a public bathroom due to use by several people and poor hygiene is a place full of viruses and bacteria where it is very easy to contract infections as is known from a substantial medical literature the bioaerosol that set of droplets that forms following the use of the toilet and the drain reaches the surfaces on which it is deposited but also persists in suspension for many minutes and can also be inhaled after the evaporation of the water
furthermore with the advent of the covid pandemic recent studies have highlighted how swabs carried out on surfaces such as toilets and sinks were positive after their use by infected subjects but also asymptomatic or apparently cured
rules of good personal hygiene and cleaning of common areas are to be put into practice every day but they are not enough today it is now more than ever necessary to pay attention to a radical resolution of a neglected problem
the collaboration between prof arcangelo liso from the university of foggia and prof roberto verzicco of the university of rome tor vergata made it possible to develop a system that could revolutionize the hygiene of public toilets following laboratory experiments the use of a specific foam was tested with persistence and adhesion properties capable of trapping urine droplets and avoiding the formation of bioaerosol that forms during urination and subsequent discharge this innovative product with a detergent action is biodegradable nontoxic to humans or harmful to surfaces and its constant use would reduce the need to sanitize the bathroom after each single use it would be enough to spray a layer of foam inside the toilet to completely eliminate the production of bioaerosol this project of the university of foggia as well as if there are any others can therefore represent a valid prevention tool for the spread of covid and a strategic ally in the slow return to normality let the european national and regional institutions consider all the possible solutions posed by scientific research and immediately support them there is no further time to waste in the meantime citizens should be informed including of the risk of contagion by air from the toilet and specific restrictions on access to all public toilets are set up

"to all those who receive my message
i recognize that some of you feel it is insensitive to campaign during these difficult times and i apologize for that i understand what many of you are going through and i sympathize with you however the election will proceed as scheduled in spite of the pandemic
new council members will vie for a place on the ballot when the primary ballots go out at the beginning of july
the election for mayor and city council is a watershed moment for scottsdale after  years in office the current mayor is termed out additionally there are three seats on city council open with only one incumbent running
i want to relay my message to the voters that i am a voice for them i would prefer to meet in person and have face to face contact with questions and answers but it is not possible we are all navigating these uncharted waters together nothing is by the book any longer
i believe that the voters do not like what they see from the current city council majority and want to return to a citizen friendly council
i want you to know that i was the point person for prop  that guarantees control of the preserve to the voters
i want you to know that i was on the coalition of greater scottsdale that tracks all the requests for zoning change and reports this information to the public
i want an informed electorate i want every person who is eligible to vote to cast a ballot that is why i have been actively engaged in spreading my message i hope that once the immediacy of covid and the breakdown of our economy are in the rear view mirror you will understand why i have chosen to run my campaign in spite of all the adversity in our world today
of greatest importance is that all of you are safe and healthy and can weather the storm and begin to have faith that the worst is behind us

"update on hab is investigation in the bears missing limbs within  mile radius of asheville nc
hab is still having serious issues with getting ncwrc to make priority or take action in this historic tragedy we apologize to our followers the state must order an outside investigation into this historic tragedy and the reaction to it by ncwrc hab has hired legal counsel to advise in all these matters however nothing will stop hab from our investigations and dealing with all parties involved
after an incredible and heroic effort by the informant to give hab and investigators all of the information and making an offer help in any way possible there has still been no action or justice for these bears by officials the informant has decided to come out against all those being accused and meet with media sources in hopes that justice will be done for the poachers decades of animal cruelty not just to the bears but other wildlife as well the informant is details will shock the community the informant wishes to tell all so that the large group of people who have been trapping and poaching bears and wildlife will be held accountable for what they have done to all these bears who are missing limbs the informant also knows there are  or more people whose names they do not know that are involved with the  people whose names we do know the urgency to finish this is so great because this been allowed to go on long enough and more bears could be dying and becoming maimed daily
many years ago the informant turned this group in and nothing was done when the images and videos of the injured bears began to appear they felt compelled to try again with hab to get the cruel people stopped now this brave hero wants to publicly face those whom they are accusing so that the poachers are forced to come forward with the rest of the names of those involved
colonel morgan along with other members went to meet with the accused ringleaders before the covid outbreak mr and mrs morgan were tired of nothing being done by authorities to even interview and stop these people or the store in burnsville that is openly selling bear traps and attractants for trapping also members know there are likely more bears dying daily until someone stops the poachers members hoped to do this by visiting the ringleaders personally four homes were visited with no one willing to answer however three people did begin communication by phone but were not willing to even hear the accusations against them as soon as bear trapping and bear parts was mentioned one main poacher asked more than  times who the informant was then hung up and called the police on members for harassment which was a false accusation that will be civilly dealt with hab kindly gave many of the men a chance to face what they have been accused of and lead us to the others whose the names we do not yet know the informant believes these cruel cowards need to be publicly confronted with all of the information and stopped in order to expose the others that could still be doing this hab will be contacting a select few media sources to give the full report to and offer for the informant to conduct sit down interviews with them so the story can be known and bears and animals be saved
after the informant is interviews are complete and last poachers tracked down the full report will be made public
at the recommendation of colonel hershel s morgan ret hab is currently developing a private team of highly experienced former elite military investigators to begin finishing the investigations for the remaining names and other tips that have recently come in to hab on other trappers and poachers of bears in the region col morgan is one of our main members who knew from the beginning that the injuries to the bears were from trap escapes and people were trapping bears his lengthy incredible and decorated military career including serving time as a  year  month pow in vietnam help colonel morgan guide members to the best solutions and people to stop this for good we will post more information on these efforts that will ensure that all matters are soon investigated by those who are some of best in the world at tracking terrorists and poachers
the bears deserve a bounty and bounty hunters for those that hurt them
please sign and share the petition to finally end the cruelty caused by steel jaw traps and snares of which thousands have been sold by amazon for years around the world

"today is international labor day
this year the day takes on extra meaning as we recognize those who work to get us all through this crisis we thank the thousands of workers on the front lines across the union health workers emergency responders nurses factory workers supermarket cashiers cleaners and garbage collectors for their selfless working for the protection and wellbeing of others in the coronavirus pandemic i am especially grateful to women who make up the overwhelming majority of workers in the health and care sector and are undervalued said eu social affairs commissioner nicolas schmit
however the crisis is also showing us that the eu initiatives on employment and social policy that have already been announced are still relevant
we must focus our efforts on tackling unemployment ensuring job security protecting the most vulnerable and investing in the skills people will need in an even more green and digital future and we must ensure that all workers including those on the front lines of this crisis are paid a wage that allows them to have a decent standard of living
therefore together with the social partners we will continue our work on a minimum wage initiative and on strengthening collective bargaining
later this year we will present another action plan to implement the principles of the european pillar of social rights be assured that the lessons learned during this crisis will be reflected in our proposals together we can overcome the crisis and create a just strong and social europe
but also the preservation of jobs is central in and after the corona crisis we also rely on shorttime work benefits
with the european shorttime work benefit initiative sure we want to support the shorttime work programs in the eu countries in this way millions of jobs can be preserved during the crisis and companies can continue to operate if there are no orders for companies and they run out of work they should be able to keep their employees in the company
sure is supposed to compensate for the difference in income to this end we are proposing a  billion fund for workers the financial support for sure takes the form of a loan from the eu to the member states that request support the loans will be backed by guarantees from member states and will be used where they are most needed
all member states will be able to use the instrument but the loans will be particularly important for the most affected countries such as italy and spain
sure will support existing shorttime work schemes in eu countries which member states use to protect jobs and protect workers and the selfemployed against loss of income with the help of sure member states can cover costs arising from the introduction or extension of national shorttime work schemes

we do not agree with this way of managing the emergency after the unfortunate events that took place in the historic center last friday which brought our city to the fore with reports on various national news programs we expected a different response from your administration

in this moment of emergency we would have expected someone to enforce the rules rather than shift the responsibility to the traders with a decision in our myopic view last night the latest news anyone who had been in the center on friday evening is invited to swab for covid indirect admission of a dangerous situation that has obviously got out of hand a further discharge of responsibility towards those who resume living the spaces left empty during the lockdown

business tax ballot measures  this elections two sides of the progressive coin heads  the very hopeful story of proposition c universal childcare in san francisco tails  the sad story of proposition d affordable housing for all despite a  million yes on d campaign on election day prop d went down in humiliating to defeat  not even winning a simple majority let alone its necessary  vote but proposition c has won a close  vote victory   to  disclosure todco strongly endorsed and provided  in support to the proposition c universal childcare in san francisco campaign the setup proposition d was put on the june ballot on january th by five members of the board of supervisors it proposed to impose a new gross receipts tax of  on revenues a business receives from leasing some commercial spaces in san francisco to fund homeless services housing for extremely lowtomiddleincome households and for other public purposes the city controller estimated it would generate approximately  million per year for such programs because it was placed on the ballot by the supervisors due to proposition  rules proposition d required approval by  of city voters to go into effect the backstory is that proposition d was quickly drafted and brought forward in the weeks following mayor ed lees sudden death with the cooperation of the staff of the new acting mayor there had been no discussion at all of such a housingfunding june ballot measure before this and prop d featured prominently as one plank in the campaign of one candidate for mayor in the june election who was endorsed by all its sponsors the second factor in this election scenario was the competing proposition c ballot universal childcare measure that would increase the same city business taxes at a higher rate   to fund quality early care and education for young children and for other public purposes the city controller estimated it would generate approximately  million per year for such programs this ballot measure had been developed and drafted in the second half of  by a broad citywide coalition of childcare service providers and advocacy groups it was put on the ballot by it proponents collecting  registered voter signatures which also means that it potentially required only a simple majority of voter approval to go into effect this legal issue has not yet been finally resolved by the state supreme court because they both proposed to increase the same tax whichever one of these measures secured the most votes  provided that prop d got its required  vote to start with  would be the one that went into effect  the other would be void prop c featured prominently as one plank in the campaign of another candidate for mayor in the june election who had worked closely with this community coalition from the start plainly both measures proposed a very progressive funding source increased city businesses taxes to achieve vital community and civic goals  more affordable housing or greatly expanded affordable childcare  that would directly benefit lowerandmiddleincome san francisco households but only one could win at best and both were part of the mayors race too  prop d very intentionally so the community conflict children vs housing was an instant wedge issue for the citys politically active progressive community constituencies prop c advocates were understandably unhappy even angered about the sudden appearance of a competing ballot measure at the last minute that was so clearly connected to the unexpected june mayors race this included a wide range of community organizations across the city of many types engaged or concerned with family and education services other activists felt that the longtime affordable housing issue a mainstay of san francisco progressive politics and a generally popular political cause was being opportunistically rippedoff for other transparent political purposes prop ds community advocates did not directly address these reactions publicly core support came from several  but not all  of the citys nonprofit affordable housing developers and their networks that stood to gain directly from prop d new funding this included the megascale multistate nonprofits like mercy housing and bridge housing local communitybased groups like chinatown cdc tenderloin ndc and mission housing development corp and their forprofit construction and management companies like nibbi bros and the john stewart co in private some prop d advocates offered a realpolitik assurance dont worry prop d cant get a  vote anyway so it wont ever block prop c and all prop c needs is  to pass as a compromise a number of groups endorsed both measures despite the selfevident logical inconsistency of this position the overall outcome of these community dynamics was a significant estrangement among the two measures supporters prop ds campaign received little community support outside the networks of its core beneficiaries and political sponsors prop c had a significantly broader community base thanks to its inclusive communitydriven development and initiation downtown opposition to props c and d there was no division among the citys business constituencies  business tax increases are bad vote no on both c and d lead by sf boma the building owners and managers association and with the financial support of the chamber of commerces san francisco forward pac various business associations and dozens of downtown property owners the committee for an affordable san francisco no on propositions c and d has so far spent at least  to defeat both measures this mainly funded mailers and many tv ads prop c alone was especially targeted due to its greater likelihood of passing with just a  vote the oppositions general theme acknowledged the worthiness of affordable housing and childcare but objected to taxing business interests alone for this as unfair andor economically counterproductive predictably the san francisco chronicle and business times both supported this view few if any community groups formally opposed either prop c or prop d political endorsements followed the political alliances of each measures sponsors on the board of supervisors the yes on prop c campaign prop cs supporters raised at least  for the yes on c campaign funding some mailers and extensive social media ads in addition to todco the principal funders included the seiu the campaign also coordinated to a degree with other progressive ballot measure campaigns like yes on f the campaigns general theme emphasized the three components of the measure  immediate lowincome child care center waiting list slots for  children future middleincome family subsidies and increased wages for child careeducation workers the yes on prop d campaign prop ds supporters raised over  for the yes on d campaign how it was used is not evident the campaigns general theme focused on the crucial need for affordable housing and homeless housing in san francisco the principle funders include two longtime political establishment pacs the committee on jobs and progress san francisco as well as many politicallyconnected developers interestingly kaiser permanent contributed  presumably as part of its new regional affordable housing program even facebook corp chipped in  several nonprofit housing developers added a total of  and the sf police officers association added  the voters judgment on june th election day downtowns sophisticated and wellfunded no and c and d campaign was certainly very effective proposition d was absolutely crushed failing to achieve even a simple  majority vote and with just  approval against a  no vote  short of its required  approval vote after a weeks counting of late ballots proposition c has won by about  votes lessons to learn this hard way  a divided community cant beat downtown because they were in direct competition with each other neither prop c nor prop d had universal community support if the community resources that were devoted to prop d had instead been combined in support of broadbased prop c then prop c would have won by a substantial margin despite the onslaught of downtown s against it but the topdown last minute prop d never stood a chance  it can take a mayors committed leadership to win revenue ballot measures especially  votes simply appealing to holy issues like affordablehomeless housing or child careeducation is not enough no bond or special tax measure needing  voter approval has ever passed without strong political support from the mayors office as interim mayor mark farrell had no real political capital to give prop d and mayoral support dramatically increases the chances for majorityapproval tax measures if the state supreme court rules this is a valid option for future voterinitiative tax measures this will be a crucial leadership opportunity for the citys new mayor  prop ds community supporters were played for fools given these two hard allthetime realities there was never any realistic hope at all of getting a  vote for prop d in the current circumstances especially while having a divisive mayors race at the same time too the cynical political strategy of at least some of prop ds initiators to use it as a wedge issue to divide progressive community resources and thereby defeat the very  from their point of view  politically dangerous likelytowin prop c may well have worked and prop ds community supporters have nothing positive to take from their humiliating  showing and wasted resources their willingness to fall for this sucker bait was astonishing in its naivet�� and the broken community trusts it leaves behind may prove hard to heal  downtown can be beat prop cs victory without mayoral and establishment support and against strong opposition shows the path to winning progressive ballot measures  even sizeable new downtown taxes it appealed not to just the left but to all san francisco constituencies concerned with the future of children and families in the city it proposed to financially assist not just lowerincome households but middleincome families too and it mobilized a diverse community network that does not usually engage in electoral contests the citys child care and educational providers and their many members this is an important victory john elberling president todco

on friday november th  my husband and i took our  year old son jaden to coastal pediatrics for what we thought were cold like symptoms with a couple of bright blue bruises on his hips and wrist but ended up being so much more over the past month prior to his pediatric appointment jaden had ran a couple of lowgrade fevers that were easily treated with tylenol and was also complaining of left foot pain while at daycare jaden would complain of being really col  d would try to sleep longer than  hours during nap time and just didnt have the strength to play with others the pediatrician listened to our concerns said we should get some outside sendout lab work done and go from there before we left he wanted to check jadens hemoglobin levels an average hemoglobin level for children would be  jadens was at  we were sent immediately to musc childrens er thats where our journey begins over  days of around the clock bloodwork labs with negative results along with countless blood and platelet transfusions on november th  jaden went in for a bone marrow biopsy that night around  pm our lives were changed by his diagnosis bcell acute lymphoblastic leukemia the lab work came back that the leukemia was not hereditary and had not spread to any organs or into his testicles so the chances of jaden having kids of his own are not jeopardized in two days on wednesday november th jaden had to have another surgery to place a port into his right chest and also have a spinal tap the spinal tap labs came back negative for any leukemia cells being resent in his spinal fluid or the central nervous system jadens first round of chemotherapy was done into the spinal tap for precautionary type reasons the first round of chemo is called induction this lasted for  days during induction jaden received his chemo intravenously as well as by mouth he had to take steroids twice daily for  days by mouth along with  other oral medications on the th day december th jaden had to have another bone marrow biopsy and spinal tap in order to see if the leukemia was still present in the bone marrow on december th we received the phone call that jaden was officially in remission the bone marrow biopsy had to show to be less than  of leukemia cells which states that cells were no longer there starting on december th  jaden then started the next phase of chemotherapy called consolidation this also lasted for  days this round of treatment included  spinal taps   and  as well as  days of oral chemo to be taken at home every night on  on the th day jaden had to return to clinic to get his cbc bloodwork checked to confirm if his body was still responding to treatment by the different counts within the blood one of the main counts that his body has to pass is the anc levels these levels have to be at  to continue to the next stage on  his level was at  on  his level was at  the most recent visit on  is level dropped even lower to  his oncology doctors stressed to us that this is not uncommon and that we will continue to check these levels until they are met on a daily bases jaden has to take at least  different medications he has to have an antacid because the chemo and steroid medication can irritate the stomach lining laxative because the chemo can cause constipation zofran for nausea gabapentin three times daily for neuropathy and bactrim twice daily precautionary antibiotic for pneumonia every friday saturday and sunday these medications will be taken everyday until he is done with chemotherapy which will be at least  years on top of these  medications each round of chemo has an additional special important added medication that he must take for the next  months at least jaden can not attend daycare due to how compromised his immune system is currently this means that mom has become his teacher in learning life long basic skills such as the alphabet and numbers he cant play and interact with other kids his age he cant go out in public without a face mask especially right now because its flu season along with monitoring his medications we also have to monitor his temperature which can spike at any given time anytime his temperature gets to  or higher we have to immediately notify the hematologyoncology team with musc and go straight to the er also if jaden displays signs and symptoms of coughing runny nose fatigue lack of appetite or any unusual changes we have to notify the hematologyoncology team with as much details as possible and for how long the symptoms have been present every day we have to work with jaden on his exercises and stretches since the only places he can go right now are home and the hospital due to it being flu season hes lost a lot of muscle strength since he cant run and be an active  year old and the chemotherapy has already given him neuropathy so it hurts him to walk for an extended period of time and he cant walk up the stairs anymore due to the pain and lack of strength with all the daily responsibilities we cant plan life in advance we cant make plans for next weekend a family trip or plan to see any of our family members each day jaden wakes up we dont know how hes going to be feeling that day and what surprises await us at all times we have to have an overnight bag packed and ready to go in case we have to report immediately to the er we cant have visitors or see our family unless they havent been sick or had any symptoms within  hours and they must wear a mask to share jadens story with others i have designed and made a cancer ribbon decal that transitions into

during the talks the prime minister told liberty steel that the pnl government is priority is to support infrastructure projects because from our point of view infrastructure is a key element for the economic development of galati but also of the whole country
also the pnl government will soon finalize the economic recovery measures plan which will contain a financing component from european funds and is correlated with the policies of the european commission and is based on stimulating public and private investments and increasing the competitiveness of produced goods in romania
from this point of view the government led by ludovic orban will pay special attention to the steel area which for galati is an essential component of the local economy through the plan of economic measures that the government will adopt we want to relaunch the economy on a healthy basis

ok folks it is election time once again right up front i am begging anyone that reads this to share it share it everywhere we need this to go viral i know that you have heard this stuff about how important this midterm election is but please hear me out the special counsel is busy with his massive investigation of election fraud and it is has been over a year since it started republicans have been screaming and whining that it is taking too long despite the fact that investigations of this nature are notoriously complex and long lasting in fact this particular investigation is like warp  when compared to special counsel investigations from the past where they run at mph but the problem is that even if he reveals that trump has conspired with russia to throw the election toward him even if he did violate election finance law by paying off famous women of the sex industry porn stars and models to hush about his toadstool affairs even if he did sexually assault someone even if he lies to everyone about everything evades taxes fleeces the us government through his excessive golf trips to his own resorts violates the emoluments clause of the us constitution andor breaks the law in some way that i havens thought of or remember trump is going to have the support of ignorant backwoods half toothless morons that barely have an elementary understanding of civics remember they also have the right to vote trump has abused the power of the presidency we all know this he is also one of two presidents that have lost the popular vote and have collectively appointed  judges that do not represent the majority of the people to the supreme court republicans have had the entire government in their control for going on  years and have done mostly nothing for the majority of the people what they have done is taken every step possible to thwart an independent investigation into the administration that has been underway since trump has been in office they have done everything in their power to strongarm the judicial appointment process ryan mcconnell grassley nunes gowdy and any other republican official that has anything to do with enabling this erosion of the american government should be removed from office this election is not just a typical midterm election it is putting an emergency brake on this administrations abuse of power it is taking our country back from the oligarchs that use their money that they made on our backs to buy our government out from under us it is one of the primary reasons that our country was founded in the first place we pay taxes and we are not adequately represented our voices are not heard in this republican vacuum big corporations are drowning out our voices by spending massive amounts of money to legally bribe our representatives they dont have the accountability of citizenship or the right to vote but they have an unreasonable amount of influence in our elections allowing republicans to run our government has proven to be a colossal screw up of nearly biblical proportions it is literally the most important one in my lifetime so make sure that you vote,1

let us talk about illegal immigration myths instituting a fair american minimum wage as i have described and which progressives and conservatives have supported in the past would actually curb illegal immigration a california businessman amp conservative ron unz predicted several years ago that  billion in welfare spending could be saved on low wage workers with a poverty neutral minimum wage and argued that loss of jobs the gop is traditional argument in opposing min  imum wage legislation is actually part of the solution more americans would be attracted to the higher paying jobs in effect pushing out the illegal immigrants americans want to work they just do not want to work for peanuts unz wrote in effect a much higher minimum wage serves to remove the lowest rungs in the employment ladder thus preventing newly arrived immigrants from gaining their initial foothold in the economy jb mitchell economist put it like this each american working in the newer higher paying jobs would deny one to someone who is not supposed to be here in the first place this would eventually disincentivize illegal immigration pcl,1

a few days ago i wrote an article about the tragic death of my father the outpouring of love and sympathy and kindness that has been demonstrated by almost everyone who has read the article is exhilarating  it has strengthened and heartened my readers and i to see the spreading of love and care god bless america and its people americans are simple honest people they are not as conniving and as calculating as most other people they call it as they see it  some take this as a weakness but i now know this is a strength it is time to make people feel good about themselves and this country we have been bashing each other and the country for too long it is time to come together unite and inspire one another with good deeds and the benevolence that our country affords us all be a democrat or a republican be whatever you want but first and foremost be an american be a friend you owe it to past generations who kept the world free let us help uplift one anothers mood and morale and that of the whole country we have been lead to believe that we are opponents and enemies when we are really one people one people under god and for those of you who do not believe in god just one people it is depressing to be constantly fighting each other because we have different opinions and are vocal about it in a detrimental way let us just agree to disagree and that should be the worst of cases the best case is to listen to one another and hear each other i write my views about politics and sometimes some people may not agree with methat is natural  but i do not let it consume me with hate and arrogance and insults to others this is just a part of my life and there is much more to it like the common joys we all have in life our love of our families our shared common pains and tragediesour purpose in life should be much more than putting each other down and insulting one another because we disagree on a political level i hope that we can unite and be civil towards each other because we have a lot more in common with each other than we have differenceswe share the challenges of life  thank you for your love and support and the amazingly positive response,1

"denmark is vision asks
should we point fingers or cooperate
the corona crisis in denmark seems to be coming to an end this time and we can breathe a sigh of relief
denmark was not hit as hard as feared we have been afraid and unsure of how covid would hit denmark
the time has now come for reflection on the last few months
questions with why are being asked
why did the government choose the strategy they now chose
why did the national board of health take so long to realize that corona also came to denmark
why did they choose to reorganize the whole healthcare system
why did the government choose to amend the epidemic act before the closure of denmark with regard to compensation
many decisions were made in march based on concerns
one was worried about getting italian conditions one was concerned about how contagious covid is
all the same understandably but the downside of making a decision out of a concern is that it is not always well thought out decisions made based on concerns are often made on the basis of fear more than reason
the worry of getting italian conditions must not be said to have happened
but decisions were made for the health service to avoid it
now it is happening which we danes are good at the danes are good at being backward and want to point fingers
when we look back with the knowledge we have today so yes perhaps different decisions could have been made during the corona crisis the problem is and we forget that at the time the government made the decision no one knew this political decisions were made based on the knowledge available at the time
in denmark is vision we do not believe that time should be used to point fingers instead it is time to dump her and move on
just as at the beginning of the corona crisis there was a unanimous parliament that backed the government so let is see a unanimous parliament find solutions for how we can best get denmark back
let us learn from the past to make better decisions for the future
in denmark vision we look ahead and we see denmark as a united country for all citizens neither blue nor red but a mixture therefore we are the purple ones

free yourself live a life you truly love amp adore its time to let go of all your unwanted feelings issues and blockages to your goals at the core so you can be your true self free from limiting patterns feel great for no reason whatsoever and be do amp have all that you deeply desire within your heart easily amp effortlessly this is paradise waiting to be revealed within your own being the question is what is the most efficient way of going about this before we talk about that its helpful to take a look at how we create our life experience first so how do we do that in my experience we are already whole complete and free we are already the freedom the inner peace the wholeness the completeness the oneness the unconditional love the joy the harmony the abundance the power the fulfillment and more that we seem to be looking for outside of ourselves we are already our true self the reason why we may not feel that way yet is because that seems to be covered up with layers upon layers of limiting thoughts amp feelings that we are identified with this thing that we call the ego all the pain the suffering and the discomfort we experience in life comes from this for most of us some of these limiting thoughts amp feelings are conscious but most of them are subconscious and the totality of what we hold in our consciousness defines not only the way we feel internally but also the reality that we experience externally note in reality there is no such thing as inside amp outside because everything is appearing in our consciousness the only reason why it feels that way is because we are carrying a sense of separation that makes us feel that way but well use those words for ease of communication internally those thoughts amp feelings are what gets us into action or prevents us from taking action and externally life acts like a mirror that reflects to us those thoughts amp feelings in the form of situations events interactions with people and anything else we may experience what we call life is a projection or a reflection of our consciousness life does not happen to you it responds to you anonymous so if we want to change what life is reflecting to us we need to let go of whats creating that experience within us if we want to accomplish certain goals we need to let go of whatever is not in alignment with those goals within us if we no longer want to experience certain thoughts amp feelings obviously we need to let them go and if we want to realize our true self the true nature of reality we need to let go of the false self or illusory self aka the ego so now the question is what is the most efficient way of going about this what is the most efficient way of unraveling dissolving letting go of this sense of limitation of this ego to answer that question i will share with you the journey that i have experienced as that is relevant for this next part when i started releasing the blockages in my subconscious the initial method that i was drawn to was all about changing the root belief systems that were blocking the flow in a particular area of life and initially i got some pretty amazing results with this technique but when it came down to actually working on the things that i really wanted to achieve and the places where i felt really stuck this method could not take me there not even close the curve of progression that was initially so amazing completely flattened and even hit a dead end and i intuitively knew that i had to go deeper into the subconscious to the place where i was holding all these limiting patterns all these blockages and the other thing was that in this initial method there was a root belief system here and a root belief system there and a bunch of root belief systems everywhere and being a big fan of common denominators and how the simplest truths the core truths are the most powerful it got me thinking about what is at the core of all of these root belief systems i felt that if we knew what was at the core how that core was designed that we could reverseengineer it or in this case that we could dissolve it in a very direct amp efficient way which could dramatically simplify amp speed up this process i wanted a way to do that that was easy amp universal that everybody could use because on some level i knew that i would be sharing this with many people at some point and so i started asking what is at the core of all this suffering amp discomfort that we experience what is at the core of the ego what is it made of show me the core of the ego the simplest truths are the most powerful anonymous from then on through some amazing realizations of the true nature of reality working with a few key selfrealized teachers that specifically knew about the design of the ego they are very rare and an extremely powerful method that i will be sharing with you  life has taken me deeper and deeper into the layers of the subconscious until it revealed the full structure of this sense of limitation i realized along the way that it wasnt just about what was at the core it was about the full structure of this sense of limitation from the surface of our consciousness all the way to the core there are a few key layers that need to be addressed to properly dissolve this in an efficient way and i can tell you that there is an inner duality that is operating in our subconscious that is keeping us stuck living a limited amp uncomfortable reality that very few methods or selfrealized teachers talk about additionally while there are some great insights that many spiritual teachers share about the ego the sense of identification the sense of me or i in my experience the technique that dissolves that identification in a practical methodical and reliable way was missing i was surprised to find that this knowledge was so rare amp so difficult to access even for someone that had been specifically looking for it then again it made sense that the answers only came when i was really ready for them when i was really ready to break free as the quote goes when the student is ready the teacher appears and it certainly played out that way in my experience and if you are reading this chances are you are ready to break free too and for that i am super excited for you that you gave yourself access to this powerful combination of knowledge method and guidance about me my name is chamsi i help people let go of unwanted feelings issues and blockages to their goals at the core so they can be their true self free from limiting patterns feel great for no reason whatsoever and be do amp have all that they desire deep within their heart easily amp effortlessly in this complimentary guide to releasing at the core i will be sharing with you an overview of how this sense of limitation we are identified with this ego structure that gives rise to all the unwanted feelings issues and blockages to goals is designed from the surface of our consciousness all the way to the core the amazing method that i use for myself amp my clients to dissolve this sense of limitation in a simple efficient and powerful way and if you want to unlock your specific blockages at the core and in an accelerated way you will have access to working with me along with a wonderful incentive to try this work for yourself in my experience amp that of the people that i work with access to this knowledge method and guidance is absolutely priceless amp lifechanging and if applied it can save you years decades and more in pain amp suffering this has been a true irreplaceable gift in my life

"midland daily news rep annette glenn rmidland who is vice chair of the house appropriations subcommittee that determines the state department of environment great lakes and energy is budget is hopeful that whitmer will reconsider assigning that investigation to egle
flood victims deserve a thirdparty independent investigation to ensure a fair and just conclusion for the thousands of families who have been devastated glenn stated in a news release late wednesday night
in april just three weeks before the two dams failed michigan attorney general dana nessel sued boyce hydro for allegedly illegally lowering wixom lake in  and  and killing thousands if not millions of freshwater mussels according to the lawsuit
was protecting mollusks more important than protecting the people of midland glenn stated in the news release and were snails more important than the people of sanford that is a question only an independent investigator can be trusted to investigate and answer
glenn said any conflict of interest must be eliminated and drew an analogy between the flooding and the flint water crisis
we did not trust the state department of environmental quality to investigate its own mishandling of the flint water crisis glenn said and after being in a lot of wet mudfilled basements this week i know it does not feel quite right to ask one of our own executive branch agencies to investigate whether the state shares any culpability for these devastating failures this situation clearly warrants an independent investigation
at wednesday is news conference in sanford where whitmer announced the investigation a reporter pointed out that egle itself is being sued by four edenville homeowners in a classaction lawsuit related to the breach of the edenville dam
are you confident that if they egle find themselves at fault that they would call themselves out on that would they report that to you the reporter asked whitmer
im confident that egle will do the kind of investigation that we all deserve and that we all expect and i will ensure that that happens the governor responded
glenn said other regulatory bodies and individuals independent of the state government have the technical expertise to conduct this investigation such as the us army corps of engineers
imagine how flood victims would react if the owners of the dams announced they were directing their own staff to conduct an investigation glenn said
sen jim stamas rmidland told the daily news he agrees with glenn that egle is not the right entity to be investigating the dam failures
if you have a question concern or need help involving coronavirus flooding unemployment or any other issue involving our state government contact rep glenn at annetteglennhousemigov or ",1

almost  weeks ago we announced the drafting of a bill requiring the president and the government to provide explanations for the establishment of the state of emergency and the measures taken as well as a detail of the rights and freedoms that have been revoked and those who have have been targeted in this regard
the article in the world of justice confirms to me once again that the alde approach is the right one
we have the right to know on the basis of which the orban government has implemented without any consultation without any discussion eu recommendation  which establishes a common set of instruments at eu level for the use of technology and data for the purpose of to combat and emerge from the crisis caused by the covid pandemic in particular with regard to mobile applications and the use of anonymised mobility data
basically the implementation of the recommendation made it possible to monitor the population through telephones romanians cannot be located and tracked by telephone companies without the consent of their subscribers those who buy their services when you sign a contract with a telecommunications company you do not sign the agreement to be followed at every step
but the pnl government does not hinder such small things as the rights and freedoms of the citizen everything is allowed if it ensures that they stay in power however the obedience of telecommunications operators is incomprehensible i am pleased to remember the general manager of the largest telecommunications company in romania who in  resolutely entered my office as prime minister to protest against the intentions of the intelligence services to put their fingers in their servers out of duty and respect for the customers he had teams have changed habits have changed
probably both pnl and telecommunications operators are encouraged in their actions by the  of romanians who seem not to be bothered by the violation of civil rights and freedoms we at alde remain in the  who care

disclaimer the following blog post includes discussion of social issues it is adapted from a coming book by william thomas harriman tom and is published on this page by david perry both page and blog have been strictly nonpartisan from inception unexpected wisdom how has the american identity formed itself during the past  years  from amidst an immense diversity of conflicting ideas and beliefs why has the clash of differing opinions led to patriotism and strength what is going on the idea that unity is strengthened by diversity may seem counterintuitive at first yet we have many examples of how this works in his book the wisdom of crowds james surowiecki describes compelling evidence that large groups of people possess an extraordinary power to solve problems when their judgment is aggregated and he shows that the more diverse the crowd the more efficient the solutions citing many examples surowiecki describes the conditions in which democratic decisionmaking does and does not work he tells us of the surprise of scientist francis galton when  participants in a raffle at a county fair submitted guesses at what the weight of a large ox would be after it had been slaughtered and dressed the analogy to a democracy in which people of radically different abilities and interests each get one vote had suggested itself to galton immediately  the average competitor was probably as well fitted for making a just estimate of the dressed weight of an ox as an average voter is of judging the merits of most political issues on which he votes galton wrote galton who expected to confirm his view that the average voter was capable of very little good judgment borrowed the tickets from the organizers following the competition he added up all the contestants estimates and calculated the average the crowd had guessed that the ox after it had been slaughtered and dressed would weigh  pounds in fact it weighed  pounds another example described by surowiecki is the story of the  loss of the us navy submarine scorpion which disappeared in the atlantic ocean the navy had no idea what happened to the vessel where it was or how fast it had been traveling mr surowiecki recounts the story as told by sherry sontag and christopher drew in their book blind mans bluff about how a naval officer named john craven assembled a diverse group of people  mathematicians submarine specialists and salvage men  provided them with a number of varied scenarios and asked them to offer their best guesses without benefit of contact with each other all they knew was the subs last reported location the group laid wagers on why the submarine ran into trouble on its speed as it headed for the ocean floor and the steepness of descent among other things craven built a composite picture of what happened and calculated the groups collective estimate of where the submarine was the location he identified was not a location specifically suggested by any members of the group but that is where it was the navy found the wreck  yards from where cravens group said it would be mr surowiecki proceeds to demonstrate the surprising consistency of this outcome in widely varied circumstances and he explains how groups work well in some circumstances better than others as we all know there are times when aggregating individual judgments produces a collective decision that is disastrous a riot for example or a stock market bubble interestingly he writes diversity and independence are important because the best collective decisions are the product of disagreement and contest not consensus or compromise an intelligent group especially when confronted with cognition problems does not ask its members to modify their positions in order to let the group reach a decision everyone can be happy with instead it figures out how to use mechanisms  like market prices or intelligent voting systems  to aggregate and produce collective judgments that represent not what any one person in the group thinks but rather in some sense what they all think paradoxically the best way for a group to be smart is for each person in it to think and act as independently as possible my coming book will offer practical guidance for local communities to utilize diversity and engage in effective problemsolving and decisionmaking stability in a crisis and the survival of freedom will require this wisdom tom you may watch for the next post on or about march  a note to new readers a description of this project an introduction to the coming book and several chapter drafts can be found at the main blog site wwwfreedomstruthcom,1

peace zones in the south caucasus a proposed discussion for the  nd may virtual conference on nonviolence governance while staying in armenia over this period of lockdown due to the corona virus we have been holding online talks linking the  nd anniversary of the armenian revolution  to nonviolence governance as one of the key issues of the jai jagat campaign the online discussions have presented some of the ways the armenian velvet revolution has created a new armenia since  under nicol pashiyans leadership with the civil contract my step party some of the changes have included freedom of the press from censorship greater attention to human rights and education the fight against corruption the strengthening of civil society and so forth the armenian revolution has been an indigenous revolution like the freedom struggle was in india it was the people of armenia that have been able to rally together to call for a more broadbased and inclusive society this call came from within the country and is exemplary in showing the tenacity particularly of the youth in armenian society since this was an indigenous revolution there is scope for looking at how values of nonviolence are being carried into governance as india partially succeeded in bringing nonviolence into policies and programs after independence people are looking to armenia to advance this experiment further we have discovered from talking to some of the participants of the revolution that if these foundations can be sustained to endure the future this would signal a great advancement of nonviolence in governance one of the ticklish issues that continues to constrain nonviolence and the pursuit of peace in armenia is the militarization that has had to persist due to the ongoing conflict with azerbaijan over nagorno karabakh the lack of headway of peace negotiation with the osce minsk group followed by the four day war in  have made the conflict even more intractable after the nonviolent revolution there has been sincere efforts at reviving the peace dialogue and both governments have tried to prepare their populations for peace the lack of movement on substantive issues over the past year has led people to become more cynical of peace negotiations continuing in a separate effort georgian civil society since  and later through the gandhi foundation of georgia and in armenia have been pressing for a peace zone in the south caucasus the idea of a peace zone has emerged from a variety of country contexts local peace zones in the areas of conflict in colombia and philippines are examples where local communities have been committed to neutrality during a conflict between the state and insurgency groups other examples are in the autonomous regions of nicaragua where ethnic caribbean populations have created an autonomous region within the nicaraguan state to maintain peace similarly in changmai area of thailand there are autonomous regions for indigenous people the first nation people living on indian reserves in canada have been given sovereign rights within the federal structures in india the northeastern states were made up of autonomous communities with guarantees under the  th schedule of the constitution these are all examples of giving rights to secure zones which are meant to maintain peace in seeing whether any of these examples could help institute peace zones in the south caucasus it is proposed that experts from these various countries be asked to join the virutal march to talk about their experiences it would be then possible for those promoting peace in the caucasus region to give response the following international persons are being suggested to participate in a discussion on peace zones an equal number would be expected from the region  colombian peace zones zohanny arboleda muti from cinep in bogata  philippines peace zones irene santiago in mindano  nicaragua peace zones in autonomous regions peter utting and amalia in managua  mexicous border peace zone sonia deotto in mexico city  canadian first nation people james loney in toronto  australiannew zealand indigenous communities ben chapple in melbourne  northeast in india to be reconfirmed  peace in nepal subhash in kathmandu  thailands changmai autonomous region weena n from bangkok  richard rubenstein george mason university virginia usa in determining the agenda of the conference we are suggesting that it be based on the various case studies and through discussion eliciting response especially from the armenian colleagues,1

can you travel back in time annexember if we could it would be most likely that we stopped the outbreak of the coronavirus known as covid on time what if with a simple interference we could not change the actions in the past but we could be capable to reduce the consequences by allowing us self to make future changes and therefore accepting that we would travel back in time in the future what waithow let me start by putting all the problems into perspective  which have an enormous weight on our social system schools stop teaching school exams are being cancelled a whole generation will learn less productionlines of factories which do not operate complete economic sectors of the economy are being stopped and will face a rough time this list can go on and on but the most critical of all in this situation hundreds of millions of people are being affected by this not only in belgium or the netherlands we we can slightly imagine what it could mean for our economy but look only at the united states  million people face a financial crisis for sure and its a low estimate whithout further explaination it seems very clear that almost every country in the world will be hit like never before in case of a disaster or war this asks for drastic measurements that goverments and unions are taking but can those actions ever be sufficient to turn he tide of this disaster or at least limit the consequences i dont think so this could only be done with a measurement that is never been taken a measurement that need worldwide support without any examption and with a measurement of which the impact shall be greater than the suffering we need to undergo now what is my suggestion why dont we say on the th of november tomorrow well start on the st of annexember thats right one month extra once lets allow ourselves this extra month in  en in this way change our future past schools will have the opportunity to repeat important lessons factories and industries can bring down a part of the loss on a competitive way as well as all the business figures over  banks will receive extra payments for loans which make it easier to overcome the backstand they are facing now our political system will get the opportunity to work on projects that are being stopped and will help succeed in their goals and timeframes in my opinion it would help our worldwide society to release our belt a littlemaybe still not comfortable but enough to breath normally i am sure by now a lot of people have second thoughts about this idea and to me honestly that makes sense once i was in a situation on the road where i needed to hurry to a meeting but i had to go to the bathroom as well i could choose to stop at a gas station and take the risk of being late or i could drive like thisand if there was an accident on the wayi certainly would not take part at that meeting my concerns where set asidebecause at this moment is there a better alternative to stop the flood of economic force of the majority and personal suffering as we are facing now annexember our th month that we need to claim are you in copy this message on your timeline and lets see how far we can get to a serieus social solution  annexember  imagine  whatif  coronavirus  covid by jacques geense,1

here in new york we wont stand for a democratic congressional rep that casually employs racebaiting as a tactic to discredit new voices a few thoughts on this since i first heard the news patel is the th most common last name in the us with nearly  of us in the country bearing the name most know were not all related in fact an entire region of india employs the last name and today its the most common name for a doctor in america but we also write p  aint act work live love and yes  sometimes we run for congress on the subject of fundraising  raising money for a political campaign is a necessary evil trust that for most of us running its the worst part of this process and one i hope to change by supporting public financing of elections and banning corporate pac money im running my campaign differently for just this reason its my hope that in the future political campaigns will be used as acts of service to educate and engage more voters this approach costs less than mailtv attack ads and is better for democracy overall and only since she brought it up  at least weve never taken money from corporate and wall street pacs or from anyone with the last name trump  if you havent contributed yet nows a good chance to prove the establishment wrong about whos backing our campaign still happily accepting support from anyone with the last name patel too,1

double your donation to help teachers in need i recently read an article which identified a number of major corporations who are matching donations made by private donors on a website that teachers use to raise funds for their classroom needs the website known as donors choose is a popular website that many teachers use where teachers explain not only what they teach but those supplies that are needed for their students in their classrooms this can vary from small needs su  ch as books and supplies to d printers donors can scroll through hundreds of projects until they find one that they like or that affects their neighborhood school and then donate to that particular project this approach allows a donor to identify a particular teacher or project which they relate to and they can know exactly what their donation is going to fund among the corporate donors who are matching gifts on this website are duke energy sas the bill and melinda gates foundation and pricewaterhousecoopers this means that whatever amount you donate on the website one of those companies will match the donation the website notes which projects are receiving doubled matching funds and it includes nearly every project from schools in the triangle and in addition many counties elsewhere in the state for example duke energy has paid out more than  so far to various donors choose projects which is only a small portion of the  the company said it will match this is an incredible way for these corporations to give back to our schools and communities these donations help our teachers who need all the help they can get to prepare their students to compete academically and in the marketplace for jobs in the future httpdigitalolivesoftwarecomnewsandobservershareds,1

"more than ever responsibility
puente madera collective article
noise too much noise surrounds us as ismael serrano is song says noise of patriots who wrap themselves in their flags confuse the homeland with the squalor of their caves noise of inquisitors they speak to us of freedoms it would be very easy to get into their game but we must wait for the storm of saucepans horns and provocations to pass to take to the streets en masse to defend civil and social rights against fascism of a new kind against the abuses of the elites the efforts of so many good people cannot be parked or forgotten that day will come we have no doubt but now in these deescalation phases we have no choice but to grit our teeth and apply the best medicine which is responsibility
in the face of lies hate and discrimination we can neutralize them with education culture inclusion and humility we have to raise awareness and educate youth with the future of our country arguing that what cannot be renounced is coexistence that they want to take away from us and save democracy that is our responsibility
in the covid pandemic we will not forget that when more people died and all the hands to help were few the opposition only thought from the first day of using it to overthrow the government this is not responsibility it is genuine and immoral folly there will be memory
of course we will continue to confront intolerance and fascism protecting ourselves with masks full of solidarity and optimism so that their hatred will not reach us we will practice social distance and get as far away from these provocateurs as we can and we will use the best hydroalcoholic solution available which is none other than good mental hygiene so that their lies cannot affect us
it is time to appeal to individual and collective responsibility in all areas which is why we must demand from the psoeunidas podemos coalition government greater cohesion unity and dialogue between the parties that make it up and then with the rest of those who supported the investment the more the government resists the more the anachronistic torquemadas will come to less it is fundamental and responsible that this government exhaust the legislature to the maximum to implement all the measures provided for in the social shield that will protect the majority of the citizens of this country
at the international level if its leaders and transnational organizations have learned anything from this pandemic responsibility must also prevail and turn the global economy upside down because the competition of all against all and the exclusive private profit of a few will not be able to save humanity from its selfdestruction from aggressive viruses from climate change from hunger from war they must be sensible implement social and economic policies so that the resources of the planet are used for the benefit of all and not of a handful of billionaire parasites seizing the moment for the abolition of this capitalist anarchy that takes us from nightmare to nightmare once and for all the time has come for greater european integration with financial and political institutions working in the same direction putting people at the center of their decisions urgently helping the most disadvantaged and vulnerable coordinating efforts in all countries to build public health systems well endowed with human material and research resources the responsibility of world leaders at this time is essential containing the geopolitical confrontation of the great powers transforming that unlimited competition into true cooperation their decisions must be aimed at carrying out more and better public policies that lead to less inequality on our planet
finally let is go back to the beginning of this article and be responsible faced with the rise of the virus of hate and intolerance let is apply the vaccine of our smile and our inclusion responsibility a lot of responsibility
let is all move forward together no one should be left behind cheers

"regions take over testing of people in socially important activities from the state
we have today announced that we can and will take over the state is responsibility for testing priority group  socially important activities this means that in addition to testing patients care employees residents in special housing and employees in elderly care and care for people with disabilities we will also test for example police officers firefighters bus drivers
after a hard job recently the stockholm region now has the opportunity to test  people a week just over  more than what the state asked for in its original strategy but it does not stop there our ambition is to test even more testing is important from several aspects it is not least about reducing uncertainty creating security for those affected and relatives stopping the spread of infection and being able to restart sweden is economy
patients and people with symptoms should also be able to be tested if gps deem it necessary
note today we see an increase in the number who need medical care both intensive care and inpatient care it is essential that we all continue to follow the authorities recommendations keep hold in out and distance

covid corona
stockholm region
all engineering homes are tested
thanks to our mobile sampling teams we are now starting to test and scan entire nursing homes in the county both residents and staff with and without symptoms for covid and antibodies we must be able to call in where the infection is to prevent it and we must test to provide security to those who live and work in the county is nursing homes and to relatives we start with the  most covidaffected elderly homes in the county and then work our way down
some planned care is resumed
as the need for healthcare for covid is slowly declining our regional special healthcare management now sees the opportunity to start up some planned care again the aim is to reduce deferred care as far as possible start reducing the queues now it is both about certain surgically planned care and planned outpatient care but this should and must not affect the emergency care there must be some flexibility so that we can quickly increase capacity if the need for healthcare for covid increases again
the situation right now
  additional people have been found to have covid disease which means that a total of   people have been found to be infected in stockholm
  people with confirmed covid have so far died
  patients with covid are currently cared for in intensive care at an emergency hospital
in addition to those receiving intensive care   patients are cared for in emergency hospitals or in geriatrics with covid
number discharged from emergency hospital or geriatrics  
of the samples with established infection   people were sampled at special housing for the elderly sabo of a total of  sabo and  shortterm residents in the county   have any residents with a positive diagnosis of covid",1

the last few days have been unsettling in an already deeply disturbing time as pipe bombs are arriving in postal distribution centers around the country destined for democratic politicians and critics of the president even prior to this the level of political acrimony seems to have reached new highs  or more accurately lows at a league of women voters candidate forum i participated in on wednesday night the maga hat wearing crowd hurled insults and invective at the mod  erator the participants and other attendees making it impossible to have a real conversation the type that our country so desperately needs instead some of those attending the debate made other audience members feel so uncomfortable even unsafe they were forced to leave something that should never take place at a political forum that anger and vitriol is in such abundant supply is no surprise in today is politics but there are lines that are being crossed in the past two years ive experienced serious death threats as have many of my colleagues we are lucky that these threats have not been acted upon but are mindful that others are not so fortunate just in the time ive been in congress ive had two colleagues  one democrat and one republican  shot just for doing their jobs and being dedicated public servants for better or worse and at present it is very much for the worse no one sets the political tone in america more so than the president in his celebration of violence against reporters his efforts to divide the country along ethnic and racial lines his mockery of immigrants and sexual assault victims he has done more than coarsen the political climate  he has made it downright toxic while it is easy to say that both sides are to blame for the heated rhetoric only one person in this country can truly drive the conversation and bring people together or tear them apart solely with his words the president no member of congress can do this no senator no governor  only the president and his words matter we are not enemies but friends lincoln said in his first inaugural address though passion may have strained it must not break our bonds of affection our best leaders have always understood that americas greatest strength lies in its unity and the inherent goodness and decency of its people the midterm is a referendum on many things including the majority partys failure to help the middle class its attacks on peoples access to health care and the corruption in the administration but it must also be a repudiation of the presidents divisive conduct and of a congress that has done nothing to stop it,1

"public or private health no dilemma for the lombardy region
the discussion on the effective management of the covid emergency to date is mainly driven by statistical data which certify a clear failure of the lombard health system compared to that of the veneto despite the two regions being led by the same political force the northern league in this world crisis lombardy in the latest bulletin has the highest mortality rate in the world  deaths more than the sum of all the other regions of italy compared to the  of veneto
so why as soon as all this is highlighted as happened by the hon riccardo ricciardi in the chamber are all parties getting angry including the majority ones why is it forbidden to talk about emergency health management why cant we say that roberto maroni and roberto formigoni who are accusing each other in the newspapers today have destroyed the lombard health system
the report service called into question the entire lombard management both from the managerial and economic point of view on which the president fontana not only did not show any intention to change pace but paradoxically affirmed that he had an effective response from his system sanitary from what emerges however in lombardy unlike the other regions excluding lazio it seems that private healthcare has decided to grab the assistance services that require minimal expenditure from the management point of view and guarantee maximum profit thus choosing which pathologies cure furthermore it seems that there is a saving on employees who are not guaranteed some rights provided for by the ccnl to these problems is added the fact that in lombardy there was a delay in the response of the private sector to the covid emergency as it was not contractually obliged to fulfill the requests of the region contrary to what happened in other regions where a management mainly public has allowed a better coordination of resources then at the base of all this there is an ethical and political problem in contrast with the nationalist dream of the northern league and the italian right we are talking about the movement of millions of euros of public money paid by taxpayers and moved from the region in favor of health private in tax havens such as luxembourg and the netherlands where taxes are practically zero on dividends
despite all these evidences which cannot be deleted from a newspaper page purchased by confindustria lombardia aiop aris and the lombardy region when asked by the journalist whether lombard healthcare will once again be a little more public than private president fontana he answers no",1

i run a healthcare practice because i want control over my income my impact and my lifestyle well that is what i thought would happen when i started my own clinic but i was wrong i wanted control over my income control over how i do things control over my lifestyle control over my freedom the result was a bit different than my expectation i struggled to pay the bills to have weekends to get new patients to keep new patients i struggled to create any kind of positive fulfilling lifestyle owning a business is not like a job in a job we get paid holidays sick days all we have to do is turn up and do the job reasonably well and we get paid in business everything is reliant on us we have to make sure we are getting clients through the door and keeping them otherwise there will be no lights no water no business we have bills to pay staff to manage we have to make sure the practice is kept alive or we do not get paid so how can we overcome the struggle its not like all healthcare practices are struggling fast forward  years things are very different for me now in an extremely positive way thats because i saw the future i was going to have if i did not change anything i knew i had to find a way consistently and predictably attract convert amp retain my ideal patients so did not end up tired overwhelmed and burnt out i knew this because i saw it all around me i had to break the cycle because i wanted to be happy i wanted to feel good about going into practice and i wanted to have the energy needed to make incredible transformations in my patients lives because they needed it and in the past it was my passion i wanted to get back to the positivity i used to have so i found successful practice owners and i modelled them i looked at what they were doing differently and i started doing that they did not rely on referrals or word of mouth to get new patients they did not have to chase patients at networking events markets screenings health talks social media and blog posting instead they had systems in place that got their message out to people who were actually interested in what they did it meant people were finding them while i was working crazy hard working late nights a lot of broken sleep and a lot of missed weekends with friends and family they were taking vacations they had extra play money to do the things they loved they had no debt and had reliable cash flow because their practices were full of ideal patients everyone one i had spoken to before told me it takes time to build a practice and that i should just do a good job and then people will eventually find out about me but i quickly discovered that if i wanted to have a successful business without waiting  years i had to do something different i went out and model every successful practice owner i could find i learned everything i could about marketing and sales and practice building and i eventually cracked it i found a way of making the phone ring on demand and was i consistently attracting  new patients a month abundance when i knew i would have new patients each week the stress came off i could breathe and get focused on making an impact again when your practice is working for you not against you it means you can have more time to focus on serving patients spending time with family and enjoying practice no more worry about where the next new patient coming from instead you waking up to an inbox full of people wanting to start treatment with you when there is abundance we have options do we want to expand to a new location do we want to hire a contractor to see the overflow do we become more selective of who we work with abundance is an amazing place to be now how does this apply to you i just spent the last week creating a brand new training on how you can consistently attract convert and retain your ideal patients every single month even if you have no marketing experience in this free training i share everything i did to generate a million dollars in revenue within two years of owning my own practice watch the training and discover the in is and out is of growing a hypersuccess healthcare business and what it takes to build a milliondollar practice here is the link you will be glad you watched it,1

animal rights and animal welfare  know the difference there is a big difference between animal rights and animal welfare and it needs to be clarified the american veterinary medical association has taken a formal position defining the difference between the two labels animal rights vs animal welfare in their detailed policy on animal welfare and animal rights they state that they cannot endorse the views of animal rights groups heres a quote from their policy animal  rights is a philosophical view and personal value characterized by statements by various animal rights groups animal welfare and animal rights are not synonymous terms the avma wholeheartedly endorses and adopts promotion of animal welfare as official policy however the avma cannot endorse the philosophical views and personal values of animal rights advocates when they are incompatible with the responsible use of animals for human purposes such as food fiber and research conducted for the benefit of both humans and animals lets take a closer look at the fundamental differences between animal welfare and the animal rights philosophy animal welfare  animal welfare includes all animals whether used for food companionship or sport it is based on a principle of ownership of animals it reflects a common sense approach that animals should be treated well and that animal cruelty is wrong animal welfare standards and guidelines for animal use and management are based on sound veterinary and animal husbandry experience research and practices the avma views animal welfare as a human responsibility that encompasses all aspects of animal wellbeing including proper housing management nutrition disease prevention and treatment responsible care humane handling and when necessary humane euthanasia it also means animals that provide for human needs experience no unnecessary suffering animal rights  animal rights advocates and their groups believe in the ideology that there is no distinction between animals and humans they view animal ownership as exploitation and slavery the true goal of animal rights groups is to work for legislation and humane care only until all animals are no longer owned or utilized by human beings the ncraoa north carolina responsible animal owners alliance has described what animal rights groups are all about and their activities animal rights groups exploit our love of animals to work for various types of restrictive legislation limit laws breed specific legislation mandatory spayneuter as well as laws that are steps toward changing the legal status of animals as property and the animal rights movement is about control not animal welfare supporting legislation based on emotion and philosophical interpretation provides a platform in our legal system for incremental increases toward animal status changes lately we have been accused of being against the proper care and husbandry of animals this has happened because over the years we have been working hard to shed light on extremist animal rights groups we have exposed their activities and their agenda they are afraid the public will finally realize they are staging a dramatic impact on the rights and way of life of all americans since they are feeling threatened and are afraid of exposure they have fought back against us they have called us the bad guy and much worse while doing this they have conveniently blurred the definition of animal rights which both confuses and misleads the public they accuse us of being antianimal and against animals we have even been accused of hating horses and benefiting from killing them these accusations are not even close to the truth they are outright fabrications folks who are affiliated and work with protect the harvest have pets and a number also have horses and livestock we care about animals we care about their health and wellbeing we practice and support animal welfare while these outright falsehoods that have been launched against us create more work and some challenges for us it also shows that we are making progress in short we support animal welfare but we are against animal rights taking a stand against animal rights in no way means that we do not care about animals or their welfare we do care or we would not be investing time money and a whole lot of effort in educating the public about protecting our rights animal ownership agriculture and our heritage to stay informed sign up for our newsletter httpprotecttheharvestcomnewslettersignup,1

running ads of a political nature in america right now lets you see the pain and frustration people are feeling the comments we read are filled with emotions from hope to all out rage it is easy to understand why for over a decade we have had a power struggle between congress and the white house and emotions have reaching a boiling point for some time now metaphorically were in a big relationship fight weve escalated to the point of if you dont agree with me then im  out of here it seems like were in that point of the fight where were so dug in that were ready to break up or get divorced now ask ourselves these questions what will happen if we do not resolve this fight what if it did lead to divided nations do you really think america would be better off if we broke up do you think that we would have the same military might if we were smaller separate economies if our adversaries wanted to destroy us what would we do if we were attacked while were in the middle of fighting with ourselves what would we do if we were attacked after becoming bitterly separated nations would we realistically form some coalition like the european union after just declaring that we hate each other so much that we separated we would certainly be more vulnerable and would lose the strength we have today in the world is that the outcome we really want for those who dont think dividing ourselves further is the right directionhow can we start to come back together without compromising on our beliefs there is certainly plenty of blame to go around and we know many people will focus on that in the comments but in our personal lives has anyone ever resolved a bitter fight by forcing the other person to give up their beliefs has anyone ever resolved a fight by reinforcing that its the other persons fault resolving a fight starts with small steps that usually dont focus on the things that caused the fight lets be honest were not going to start by coming together on the hot button issues our nerves are too raw right now and it is understandable because there really are some issues where we have strong differences of opinion its hard for us to see right now how wed work together without compromising on our own sense of right and wrong so let us not start there instead there are some issues where were not so different if we start working together on those issues we can start to cut the tension and division we feel and just like in the moments after we resolve a fight we could start to see the other person as a someone we care about again even if we cannot imagine that right now at that time we might be in a better emotional state to find solutions we can agree on for today is hot button issues that do not require us to compromise on our values if we the people are encouraging our elected officials to fight with each other then that is exactly what they are going to do but if we the people are united in our support of what we want no one would stay in office long without getting in line over  conservative moderate and liberal americans have already committed to working together on the issues where we agreeand we are growing we are going to voice our support together on those issues to our representatives in washington check out our site to learn more about how we are doing it,1

coronavirus in bergen and passaic counties dear friends my home of bergen county is the epicenter of coronavirus in new jersey the first victim of coronavirus appeared in my hometown of fort lee a few weeks later the largest cluster of coronavirus patients emerged a few towns over in teaneck the first coronavirus testing site in bergen community college quickly reached its maximum capacity because of massive lines and limited testing kits the only way to stop the virus is to isolate everyone test everyone quarantine the carriers and wait for the virus to die out as much as possible unfortunately however our federal and state governments failed us in this crisis by doing too little too late as a formerly undocumented american muslim who is now running for congress allow me to make a humble suggestion before we suffer even more focus on paterson in passaic county paterson is the largest city in my congressional district paterson is only eight miles from teaneck and holds nearly four times the population of teaneck a large number of undocumented immigrants and lowincome residents in paterson do not have health insurance and are especially vulnerable to the spread of the virus the rapid spread of coronavirus in paterson would be uniquely overwhelming because of the density of the population the prevalence of corruption and the lack of resources while the federal government will provide much needed relief in the form of cash injections undocumented americans will not receive any such benefits to survive the crisis if we want to save northern new jersey from the worst of covid we have to save paterson and we have to start now when we launched our campaign for congress we decided to focus on four policies that became the mantra of our campaign singlepayer healthcare fully funded public schools immigration amnesty and a strong economy the complete failure of our government in the face of this crisis showed us that we were focused on the right issues we hope you will join us and help our campaign as much as you can please take care of yourselves and stay safe thank you  alp basaran,1

the rapidly spreading lung disease covid has been keeping society in suspense since midmarch this year at the latest in view of the intensity of the infection in neighboring european countries such as italy politicians in germany reacted with legally prescribed farreaching measures based on the infection protection act these measures led to restrictions in the areas of personal freedom economic life and to some extent also political life nobody doubts the fundamental sense of these measures in order to guarantee the right to health progressive actors in the form of trade unions parties initiatives eg for a corona parental allowance advocated social compensation for the social hardship associated with them from the outset and made corresponding demands on politicians and employers
another aspect in this context is to be emphasized at this event the development and expansion of scientific knowledge about the pathogen and the infectious disease it causes is also of political importance a wellfounded knowledge of essential epidemiological parameters eg the proportion of sick people prevalence mortality rate of new cases incidence density or number of reproductions forms the basis of political consideration when determining measures that are suitable for protecting health as well as social rights and freedoms at the same time it is important to raise public awareness of what is specific to the scientific methods used to calculate or more correctly estimate these parameters and then to use them in mathematicalstatistical models to predict the course of infection and its dynamics to be used
we want to talk about these two aspects with prof hanspeter piepho biostatistician at the university of hohenheim badenwurttemberg how do scientists actually model the infection process of the covid  pandemic what can these models say and predict with what certainty and with what accuracy how can the effectiveness of individual political measures to contain the spread of infection be estimated finally since any model stands and falls on the validity of its assumptions and the quality of its data what data is available what are the strengths and weaknesses of their expressiveness what improvements in the data basis would be desirable in germany
prof dr hanspeter piepho is a statistician in the field of life and agricultural sciences since  he has headed the department of biostatistics at the university of hohenheim he is a member of numerous professional societies such as the international biometric society and a member of the editorial board of numerous scientific journals such as the biometrical journal

"the coronavirus epidemic did not stop the works on public investments that are taking place during this period in mehedinti in bicles for example the commune is a whole construction site asphalt is poured in all seven villages work is being done on a new town hall and the general school
the prefect of mehedinti county cristinel pavel was on a working visit to bicles commune and says he is satisfied with the way he is working on the ongoing projects these are projects financed by the romanian government through the national investment company cni and the national local development program pndl
even if the coronavirus epidemic completely turned the lives of romanians upside down in bicles i am glad to see that the works continued within the public investments programmed by the local public administration led by the mayor lucian coanda i saw many beautiful things some important objectives and i would refer here to a new town hall the general school the cultural center and we are working on the modernization of some communal roads and village roads from the discussions i had with the site managers and the representatives of the state inspectorate for constructions i can say that the works respect the technical projects and the quality conditions  says the prefect cristinel pavel
in  days the modernization works at the school with grades iviii in bicles will be completed and the  students who study here will enjoy a school that respects all european standards the works worth about  million lei were financed by the ministry of public works development and administration in the vicinity of the school there is also a cultural center arranged with funds from cni worth  million lei which was completed at the end of  it is a building as you rarely find in rural areas with a performance hall movie screening room library workshop spaces equipped with stateoftheart technology
indeed this virus did not affect the works being carried out in our commune we are working on a new mayor is office because the current office is very small dilapidated and we have taken into account a possible administrative reorganization we want bicles to be the center of development and to connect other communes to our commune also the school is being modernized it is being expanded with toilets with a gym with new laboratories equipped to european standards stated the mayor of bicles commune lucian coanda
we are currently working on the modernization of some village roads on a total length of  km in all the seven villages belonging to bicles commune",1

dirty gratitude number  i am grateful that i wonder if i am racist i am questioning myself tonight i am digging deep and asking myself am i in any way racist i have very few friends that are not white i do not feel like this is because i chose that way i feel it is more because i live a somewhat sheltered life in the sense that i do not meet a whole lot of new people the few black friends that i do have i met through my previous restaurant job at dia  of them  are men one of them is a woman and i enjoyed working with them all for different reasons roxy is fiery and spunky and i immediately liked her we would joke about her husband and bond over girl talk i didnt work with her for very long but i missed her when she was gone armand he quite possibly has the biggest heart of anyone i have ever met he hugs everyone when he comes into work and tells them i am so happy to see you i have been fascinated by his stories of his early childhood in africa with more brothers and sisters than i can imagine and i was transported into a different life when he would talk about it he was then raised in germany and france and i loved the conversations we had about his life and where he has been he is an extremely devoted father and to watch his face light up when he would talk about his son would make anyone smile bobby is from georgia he is unnervingly polite and kind but never a pushover i always felt guilty swearing around him not that he minded i even found myself picking up dag gum as my new swear word he is also an incredibly devoted father he calls his daughter punkinhead and it might be the sweetest thing i have ever heard tarik is much younger than i and absolutely brilliant there were times when the guy would drive me nuts he loves to debate and hes good at it i didnt like it because i am more of a lets find some common ground kinda woman at the end of the day though it he challenged me to think deeper about myself without even knowing itand i greatly appreciate that about him markus oh my goodness i love him he is kind and hilarious and crazy and unapologetically gay as he should be his flamboyant nature i was immediately drawn to it was somehow infectious for me i am a huge fan of will and grace and for halloween i wanted us to go as black jack and karen at work he of course had bigger and better ideas when i found out that bobby and armand were fathers i never once questioned that they would be anything else other than devoted they are just fathers not black men who are fathers when i suggested to markus that we be black jack and karen he appeared to find it funny but now i question if that might have offended him in any way i believe that i didnt judge these men and this woman because of their skin color i believe that i had the same interactions with them that i would with anyone but i am now questioning myself was there any part of me that had a preconceived notion of them because of the color of their skin most importantly if there was what am i going to do to change that i dont know what it is like to be a minority i am a woman and that tends to comewith its own set of challenges in everyday life i do wonder sometimes how incredibly different my life would be if i were a black woman and the first thing that comes to mind is that i wouldnt want to be this is not because i believe that a black woman is less than me it is because i know it would immediately mean being at a societal disadvantage just because of the color of my skin i was a single mother at  i came from a very loving and supportive family but what if i didnt what would i have done to make money to put food on the table for my child and to diaper her would i have sold drugs quite possibly when you are desperate the color of your skin doesnt come into play survival for yourself and your child does i also used to be a very frequent drug user i am a white woman who was introduced to cocaine by her white boss i worked with all white people and a lot of them did drugs our addiction didnt care what color our skin was the reality is there are good people of every color and there are bad there are good cops and bad cops there are people who believe in a cause and will peacefully protest and there are those who are opportunists and will loot and riot and take the focus off of that cause for their own gain we are all human and the thing we need to remember is that just because we dont understand another human or dont recognize ourselves in them it doesnt make them any different than us and it certainly doesnt make them less than if you get to know someone you will most likely find that at the end of the day we all just want to be loved and accepted for who we are i bet you do one of the best quotes i have ever read is how does it hurt you to not hurt someone else i have carried it as my mantra since i read it so tonight i sit here and ask am i racist on top of that are you are you willing to dig deeper and ask yourself some of the same questions that i as a flawed human have asked myself what will you come up with if you do and when you brush your teeth tonight are you also willing to look yourself in the mirror and ask how does it

"in etobicoke centre we are mourning the loss of  residents to covid at the eatonville care centre
this week we received the disturbing report from the canadian armed forces documenting appalling and completely unacceptable conditions in the eatonville care centre in etobicoke orchard villa in pickering altamont care community in scarborough hawthorne place in north york and holland christian homes grace manor in brampton
it is beyond reprehensible that our seniors are being treated this way
as i said in the house of commons on may  we need immediate action and comprehensive reform of longterm care
the  other mps and i who represent the residents of these homes wrote to premier ford yesterday to urge him to
appoint a thirdparty manager to oversee all operations
to call a full public inquiry because a government commission is not enough and
to work in partnership with the government of canada to establish enforceable national standards for longterm care homes across our country
today in the house of commons i continued my advocacy by asking the hon patty hajdu minister of health if she will
call on the government of ontario to establish a full public inquiry and
work with provincial governments to establish and implement enforceable national standards for longterm care homes across canada
so that our seniors from coast to coast to coast can receive the quality of care that they deserve

part  of  effort for privatization of medicare before diving into part  i want to make it clear that the nrln knows how important low cost ma plans are to retirees we are not saying dont buy one but those in congress who have supported subsidizing them also push the premium support plan and it calls for phasing out ma plans and forcing retirees to choose another nonsubsidized private plan or switch back to traditional medicare plan which likely will look much differe  nt therefore our first goal is to make sure that current and future ma plan enrollees maintain their eligibility to switch to traditional medicare and second that the nrln lobby to protect or grandfather ma plan enrollees from losing the low cost advantage they can buy now ma plans have been the private plan trojan horse designed to sneak privatization in and medicare out now on to part  of our three part series in april  the centers for medicare and medicaid cms broke the mold when it announced it would expand how it defined primary healthrelated benefits for medicare advantage ma plans cms will increase taxpayer funded capitation payments to ma plan insurers by an average of  percent about  billion in  allowing them to offer more benefits thats well above the  percent bump cms initially proposed and higher than the  percent increase for  these are federal door prizes awarded to new ma plan enrollees by hhs management hoping the ma model will reduce health care costs this is shocking because it is not an incentive program and is very expensive to taxpayers simply a gift to insurers wanting to lure new enrollees during the  open enrollment period new ma offerings will include safety adaptations to a patients home air conditioners for seniors with asthma transportation to medical appointments or an emergency room healthy groceries and homedelivered meals etc these added benefits are not available to traditional medicare participants if these taxpayer benefits are proven to lower costs why would they not be offered to the  million in traditional medicare data from the  medicare trustees kaiser family foundation and cms reports show that in  the average cost for each of  million enrollees in traditional medicare part a amp part b was  the  million ma plan participant costs for medical services a and b were  per enrollee this data shows that it is less costly per enrollee to provide health care coverage for participants in traditional medicare than in ma plans subsidies rebates and quality rewards are included in ma plan costs if so why would there be too costly efforts underway to reduce healthcare costs why not attack costs within traditional medicare one program aimed at all medicare benefits there is no consensus among studies that medicare advantage plans are more cost effective than traditional medicare the october  cbo report sent to the house budget committee reported that the projected results for medicare premium support or privatization using the ma plan model would lower net federal payments to all medicare beneficiaries by  percent in  however total payments by all medicare affected beneficiaries would rise by  percent this is cost shifting not cost improvement watch for part  of  nrlns proposals to congress on medicare advantage bill kadereit president national retiree legislative network and we need your committed support to nrln action alerts wwwnrlnorgsehtml contribute to nrlns lobby effort wwwnrlnorgccdirecthtm make a taxdeductible donation to our american retirees education foundation aref research wwwseniorsareforgdonationshtml,1

"there are two monumental achievements we are celebrating this week phase ii of texas economic reopening and the graduation of our high school seniors
according to executive order ga texas is opening more doors for business and getting more texans back on the job childcare services such as ymca and boys girls clubs can resume restaurants can expand to  capacity for indoor seating and as a senator who represents grapevine shining star of the texas wine industry i am pleased to report that tasting rooms can begin reopening at  capacity as can craft breweries the order is effective through june rd and you can find more details at govtexasgov
every state in the nation has now lifted at least some of their covidrelated restrictions and texas continues to lead the way additional openings have been announced for may st little league sports camps and other youth recreation activities are set to resume at the end of the month
as texas reopens the state continues taking precautions to protect public health and safety in the first half of may texas has doubled the number of tests given in march and april combined texas is now testing  a day at over  testing sites the state has initiated an effort to test every resident and worker in texas nursing homes overall there is a downward trend in the percentage of tests that come back positive meaning the vast majority of people who are being tested do not have covid
budgets have been affected by this pandemic on every level from individuals to families to countless businesses the state budget is no exception texas officials have sent a letter to state agencies requesting a  reduction of spending in the current biennial budget as chair of the senate finance committee i support this request like every business and household budget the state must live within our means and adhere to the principles of fiscal restraint that put texas in a much stronger position than other states to meet the challenges ahead
i continue to marvel at the creativity of parents and teachers who are pulling out all the stops to ensure that seniors have a memorable graduation so far senior classes from seven denton county school districts have walked the stage at texas motor speedway with more to follow as a former nascar mom of the year whose district includes the speedway i am so grateful to tms and i appreciate everyone who has worked very hard with the texas education agency and nascar officials to make this happen
this time is certainly not what they expected but i know our graduating seniors are up to the challenge and that we will need their grit more than ever as we continue rebuilding our state is economy
i wish our seniors the very best in their future endeavors please join me in celebrating our seniors by sending them an enthusiastic congratulations

guilt guilt is the responsibility for wrongdoing apart from the wrong we are each of us responsible for personally in a sense no wrong is done anywhere that we are not all of us responsible for collectively with or without knowing it either through what we have done or what we have failed to do we have all helped create the kind of world mess that makes wrongdoing inevitable the danger of our guilt both personal and collective is less that we will not take it to heart th  an that we will take it to heart overmuch and let it fester there in ways that we ourselves often fail to recognize we condemn in others the wrong we do not want to face in ourselves we grow vindictive against the right for showing up our wrong as wrong the sense of our own inner brokenness estranges us from the very ones who could help patch us together again we steer clear of setting things right with the people we have wronged since their mere presence is a thorn in our flesh our desire to be clobbered for our guilt and thus rid of it tempts us to do things we will be clobbered for the dismal variations are endless more often than not guilt is not merely the consequence of wrongdoing but the extension of it it is about as hard to absolve yourself of your own guilt as it is to sit in your own lap wrongdoing sparks guilt sparks wrongdoing ad nauseam and we all try to disguise the grim process from both ourselves and everybody else in order to break the circuit we need friends before whom we can put aside the disguise trusting that when they see us for what we fully are they will not run away screaming with if nothing worse laughter our trust in them leads us to trust their trust in us in their presence the fact of our guilt no longer makes us feel and act out our guiltiness for a moment at least the vicious circle stops circling and we can step down onto the firm ground of their acceptance where maybe we will be able to walk a straight line again your sins are forgiven jesus said to the paralytic then rise whereupon the man picked up his bed and went home matthew  originally published in wishful thinking and later in beyond words,1

rd graders coronavirus project sitting home is literally killing our country the usa acted as ignorant cowards we will lose more lives and livelihoods than corona will ever take read this hi im jimmy im in the rd grade home doing a math and science project on the cv to determine what is best way to save lives and the economy for the greater good using the data we currently have i took  studies on how many people are at higher risk and very low risk to potential death if infected with cv then i averaged all  and rounded the numbers off for simplicity here is the data about  of the american population are at very low risk of fatality and  are at higher risk like my gramma one interesting fact there have been two cases of seniors citizens in their s and one woman was over  years old who had the virus and were treated and are doing well the  group majority is naturally the population that drives the economy and the majority of the  do not drive our economy america pulled the low risk population  out of the workforce this is illogical according to data we could have kept the economy running and tended to senior citizens and other high risk people by delivering them food vitamins medications at their home etc and potentially create jobs for people who could have delivered necessary items to the higher risk population jiao shenme minzi a medical researcher from zanjan university in china is where america wants to be with this virus i used jiao because china has complete control of the virus jiao states its a simple virus that you can get rid of meaning the cv virus will not live in your body forever like many more complex viruses if you catch it once its gone but you will have a stronger immunity for when it comes back yearly im not sure if america plans on pulling the workforce out of the economy from their jobs every year or if they are just gambling that our scientists create a vaccine viruses are notoriously difficult to cure hiv took  years to develop medicine that can prevent people from developing aids influenza has taken decades to merely reduce infection with yearly injections to about  hpv warts and herpes both are still incurable viruses the proof is in the pudding the evidence that this researcher is correctis the extremely low rate of death from this virus relative to the massive amount of people who wasis infected with cv worldwide its simple third grade math early on the cv virus was considered more dangerous than the common flu this is when we had little data as of now it has appears to be less lethal than the common flu as the common flu kills over  people every year in united states because of lack of testing in america we dont know how many people are infected the realistic estimate in us is at least  people have cv most are asymptotic because their bodies immune system fights it they may never realize they hadhave it others will have flu like symptoms perhaps worse but overcome in a week or two the low risk population who get infected will build an immunity that could help them fight the virus if scientists cannot develop a vaccine additionally building a herd immunity will reduce spreading the virus in the future the great depression killed about  million people the math suggests a recession or depression is imminent if america doesnt get the low risk population back to work this was hard to calculate but based on the trillion or more dollars weve borrowed in a couple weeks and the millions the economy is losing daily a recession is probable if the government doesnt put the low risk people back to work by mid april ive estimated if for whatever reason the low risk workers who drive the economy are not back to work by may st we will go into an economic depression many more lives will be lost in an economic depression than the few hundred america has sadly already lost to cv my conclusion shows illogical fears were the catalyst to an irrational approach to combat this unknown virus its not too late however please put your emotions aside and look at the evidence and you will see that pulling low risk economy workers was counterproductive it did not save lives because again as far as i could find no low risk person worldwide has died due to cv some people may argue it slowed the spread maybe so but if we have all our high risk people safe at home the stoppage of work only cost this country massive amounts of money not lives by this time about  weeks later from inception of cv to us the virus may have run its rounds and be on its way out pulling the economy driversworkers nationwide did set us up for a catastrophic economic oblivion and all the horrors of poverty especially to many americans i blame no one my dad doesnt allow me on facebook but he posts this everywhere he says people are arguing and fighting over everything about this virus these are scary times i dont want to lose my grandma either and i was scared i think we all must remain as calm as possible keep your health strong during this time my gram always tells me to look for opportunity during adversity i think this is an opportunity for the entire world to bond and support each other with kindness and respect ultimately we are all responsible for ourselves all the pointing fingers the entitlement of citizens demanding the government to be perfect and protect us all from such a bizarre fast spreading unknown virus is not only unrealistic its counterproductive in no way do i think my project data is a cure all or the best approach my hopes is to reevaluate our defense toward the virus im  certain what we are doing is not conducive to the greater good of america we must change the approach before we self sabotage america beyond repair i hope my project results help anyone who is scared its normal to be scared of some virus we have no idea about my project was limited in these early stages but we definitely have the living proof that its not nearly as deadly as once assumed blessings to the world may we all work together as a loving family to defeat this virus noone alive has had the same struggles worldwide if this is not a sign to unite not only in america but worldwide nothing is jimmy g thinking about a change worth making,1

most of us parents know that too much screen time for our children is not a good idea however we find ourselves purchasing electronically based gifts for our children at christmas time as it is what they want or what everyone else is buying and we want our children to fit in some of us succumb to peer pressure by giving our children phones before they are ready for them or really need them for the most part we believe that they are harmless and some of us need science t  o tell us otherwise this science is not easy to gather as it means involving young people in what is called a longitudinal study which means they need to be followed over a course of several years not easy to have parents permission to follow their child for long periods of time just today this came across my screen and i wanted to share this with you the early findings of a premature thinning of the cortexes this means the brain is consolidating neurons earlier than what is considered normal this is important as we need a certain amount of grey matter during our maturation process so that we can continue to initiate the use of more synapsis which allows us to retain information that we will need in life when the cortexes prune  or delete synapsis too early it affects aspects of intelligence this is what the study will continue to research and discover throughout its year duration long story short do your best to limit the screen time of your family members and yes that includes mom and dad too afterall you are the role model your brain is not as affected as your child is however children have this great propensity to mimic their parent is behavior the do as they see not what they hear read books magazines play games do puzzles and interact over the coming holiday season with the screens neatly tucked away you might be surprised to find out how much you yourself want to be on your screen and perhaps you as well need a little more downtime to give your brain the reboot it needs balance on my friends,1

fishing guides are a hearty breed from hurricanes recessions and water quality challenges florida fishing guides have seen and endured it all over the years while a hard part of life that small businesses are forced to endure for survival our guide members are no stranger to these adverse environments and continue to show the ability to adapt and overcome to any and all challenges that life will throw at them covid  has brought our nation to a screaming halt like a  hurricane that impacts a local area the conditions are similar but the scope of this event is nationwide and impacting all sectors for a majority of our guide members the timing could not be worse as this time of year is when many captains run a bulk of their seasons trips and the loss of this revenue will be detrimental to their operations and their ability to continue in the industry the florida guides association knows that the economic suffering of this event is far reaching and many more than just fishing guides and captains are out of work and doing their best to stay afloat we in no way encourage or want anyone to divert funds from needed supplies for family and friends take care of those needs as a top priority for those that are able and want to support local small businesses like restaurants and store we remind you that fishing guides and captains are an integral part of a communitys fabric we would encourage contacting your favorite captain and booking a trip for the future or even better consider purchasing a gift certificate with a guide for that future trip and help directly inject some needed funding to a small business in need while we hope there will be viable programs to help small business owners get to the other side the reality is a government loan or grant will be a slow and cumbersome process and the loss of revenue in such an important time of the fishing season is a hard river to bridge for our operators please stay safe and healthy and pray for our nation and her leaders as we conquer covid  together we thank you for your continued support of the florida guides association and our members,1

"fewer planes fewer cars fewer buses because of the corona pandemic we all live a little more locally that is good for the environment
but not in all areas companies are using more and more new plastic for their packaging instead of relying on recyclates recyclates are highquality flakes from old plastic from which new packaging is made
unfortunately this circular economy process is even more expensive for manufacturers than simply buying new plastic so not many do it with the slump in the economy caused by corona the price of crude oil has also fallen sharply in the current economic situation this naturally makes it even more attractive for companies to use virgin plastic made from crude oil
this is a huge step backwards for climate and environmental protection and a heavy blow for the circular economy says our initiative frosch founder reinhard schneider
together with colleagues from the recycling industry schneider warns of the collapse of the industry recycling must finally become more economically attractive
what is being done as part of the eu is corona aid package plans for a levy on nonrecycled plastic waste are currently being discussed long overdue to relieve the environment says schneider

habeas corpus is for humans not animals an elephant at the bronx zoo in new york has recently made the headlines after an animal rights group filed court documents to encourage a judge to award habeas corpus to an animal this is an unprecedented and alarming event no nonhuman animal has ever received habeas corpus to fully comprehend the significance of this legal action and its impact on all animals and animal ownership as well as human civil rights it is necessar  y to look at what habeas corpus means what is habeas corpus habeas corpus has roots that extend back to the th century in england and is most commonly referred from the magna carta the magna carta states the following no freeman shall be taken or imprisoned or be disseized of his freehold or liberties or free customs or be outlawed or exiled or any other wise destroyed nor will we not pass upon him nor condemn him but by lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land the united states added habeas corpus to our own constitution during its establishment under the suspension clause article one section  it is written as the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it the main purpose of habeas corpus is to inquire about the validity of a prisoners custody it is often used to determine if the court had jurisdiction to impose a sentence as this is a civil right the sole purpose is to protect the freedom of humans from infringement essentially in modern usage habeas corpus refers to the right of a detained individual to be brought before a court or judge to determine whether the imprisonment is legal and justified animal rights and habeas corpus the average person would understand that habeas corpus refers to human beings only and not animals but animal rights extremists do not feel that way animal rights is not the same as animal welfare the ideology of animal rights is that animal ownership is akin to slavery and therefore abuse to that end animal rights extremist groups work to end all humananimal interaction to learn more about the difference between animal rights and animal welfare,1

"before you buy apple macbook air inch gb ram gb ssd storage silver latest model consider the environment the estimated carbon footprint of this is equivalent to the weight of  chimpanzees that is equal to kg
reduce reuse recycle
consider buying used or resting what you already have instead of buying new
about carbon calculator
at carbon calculator we believe knowledge is power knowing approximately how much carbon is released in the manufacture shipping and selling of items will help make us more conscious consumers picking to buy used where possible reusing more of what we already have and recycling the things we can no longer use
about carbon calculator is estimates
carbon calculator looks at a product listing and attempts to match the product category to a north american industry classification system naics category if a match is made carbon calculator can use publicly available estimates of the carbon intensity of the naics category to make a fairly precise estimate of the carbon footprint of the item if carbon calculator is unable to find the naics category we will still make an estimate but it will be less accurate
what is coe
coe or carbon dioxide equivalent is a standard unit for measuring a carbon footprint this metric takes into account greenhouse gases ghg such as carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide and more while co is the most common green house gas other ghgs are far more harmful for the environment coe describes the different greenhouse gases as a single unit with each green house gas converted to its co equivalent ex kg of methane kg of carbon dioxide
carbon calculator uses coe to give you the most accurate measure of how much of an impact a given product has on the environment

money donated to hsus is used to train law enforcement and to meddle in environmental issues law enforcement agencies are being influenced by animal rights groups animal rights groups have become an influence on law enforcement not only through award ceremonies for example handing out humane law enforcement awards but through training as well the humane society of the united states hsus has provided many states cities and counties with material and workshops about how  to enforce animal laws and conduct seizures then after the workshops they have awarded outstanding officers and departments for their efforts this animal rights influence on law enforcement is a justifiable cause for worry amongst people who own animals the hsus has been known to take extreme measures to end all animal ownership and production they have also been known to participate in seizures and use those seizures raise considerable funds to pad their coffers therefore with law enforcement receiving training and encouragement by animal rights extremists animal rights groups are one step closer to achieving their goal of ending animal ownership training sessions offered by hsus to law enforcement the humane society of the united states training sessions for various law enforcement officers covers the following  background on animal fighting and illegal animal abuse including relevant laws  the unproven claim that animal abuse leads to other violent crimes  investigating cruelty complaints from first response to filing charges  recognizing key evidence warrants and statements most of these trainings are free to law enforcement departments trainers are former and current officers that have an expertise in finding the loopholes in animal protection laws that can be used against animal owners they also have expertise in conducting seizures the hsus website claims the animal rescue team has a long and successful track record with prosecutors judges and law enforcement law enforcement agencies across the country call upon us to assist with the investigation and prosecution of every type of animal abuse training of north dakota law enforcement often when people hear about the hsus inserting themselves into law enforcement they dismiss it thinking it doesnt impact them and that it will never happen in our agricultural state it does happen and in fact the hsus targets states and communities where they believe they can slip in without much opposition what happened in north dakota is a prime example the hsus pushed a ballot initiative in north dakota titled prevention of animal cruelty in hopes of making voters believe they were helping animals voters did not fall for the misleading legislation and voted down the initiative however the hsus was not deterred via back door methods they were able to make changes to the century code and passed similar laws as outlined in their ballot initiative despite the will of the people then they proceeded to train law enforcement on the new law which allows for an actionable claim from out of state callers and the seizure and sale of animals without notice to the owner or hearing to establish guilt or wrongdoing but thats not all  hsus asserts itself in environmental issues sealions the hsus meddles in the ecosystem with their lawsuits against removal of sea lions at the bonneville dam they have filed lawsuits against the us department of fish and wildlife multiple times creating issues with populations of salmon steelhead white sturgeon and orca their agenda is selfish as they are choosing one species and disregarding many others who are at risk of becoming endangered or are already endangered wild horses the hsus has been known for its farreaching tentacles this is proven in their activities around horses on american rangelands the hsus had teamed up with wild horse extremistactivist groups to file lawsuits and to stop the blm from being able to properly manage the horse populations what most people dont know is that the hsus has a patent on pzp a birth control vaccine therefore the hsus isnt concerned about the wild horse population as much as they are worried about their own finances environmental police awarded by humane society on july th in massachusetts environmental police officer major patrick moran as well as the board of wildlife violator compact administrators were honored by the humane society of the united states with the  humane law enforcement award environmental police are otherwise known as game wardens in massachusetts and team up with other state agencies as a part of the environmental crimes strike force according to the massgov website the environmental crimes strike force investigates and prosecutes crimes that harm the state is air land or water or that pose a significant threat to human health the strike force is an interagency team that includes prosecutors from the attorney general is office officers from the massachusetts environmental police and investigators engineers and attorneys from the massachusetts department of environmental protection dep misleading the public these agencies teaming up with hsus are worrisome considering the power they have in their respective communities they certainly are misleading the public about where their money goes when they run ads about shelter animals on television,1

immigrants have always been a vital source of us force they contribute to the growth of our economy and make our communities more rich and more diverse they are our neighbors our colleagues and our friends and are such an important part of the united states as those born in our country president trump sees things differently he has promoted public policies based on cruelty and division that demonize immigra  it has eliminated programs that protect socalled dreamers and asylum seekers fleeing violence and chaos he has defended drastic cuts on legal immigration and imposed an intolerance based on intolerance for travelers from muslim majority countries he has threatened to close our ports of entry for transit and legal trade and has exploited a crisis that he himself created on the border to gain political credits but while trump has taken the system to the most punitive end its racist policies are based on a defective immigration system and an infrastructure already vulnerable to abuse i saw it in mcallen texas in the eyes of mothers who fled violence only to be separated from their babies at the border of the united states i saw him in the tears of the families while waiting for his loved ones at the logan airport in boston the night that trump announced his muslim prohibition i saw it in the tired faces of young children forced to march in a row among improvised tents under the heat of the summer sun at the homestead detention center in florida we must face the humanitarian problem at the border and reverse the discriminatory public policies of this president but that will not be enough to fix our immigration system we need to expand legal immigration that will help our economy grow to bring together families and meet the demands of our workforce we need real reforms that provide costly security at our borders reforms that take into account the fundamental causes of migration and that provide a path to status and citizenship so that our neighbors do not have to live with fear that is why today i am announcing my plan to reform the migratory system creating a system based on rules that is fair human and that reflects our values register today to join our struggle for a fair immigration system that preserves our security grow our economy and reflect our values,1

the magic of living in flow theres a magic to being in the flow isnt there things seem to come together and you dont have to work as hard to make the changes you want to make they seem to just naturally happen i am such a fan of finding the flow versus forcing things to happen making the changes i want to see in my life didnt happen by force force just never worked for me there is a famous old ad that said just do it which definitely didnt apply to me any time  i tried to just do it i failed miserably and i judged myself harshly too i wondered why i couldnt be like other people and just do what i knew i needed to do to make the changes i wanted to make but forcing myself to change just never worked learning to live in flow did work for me though but it still took effortjust a different kind of effort instead of will power or force it took lovingly tending to the invisible forces inside me that were working against me those invisible forces inside me were actually just memories they were memories with emotions connected to them and without my understanding it at the time they would get activated and instead of acting in the present my mind and heart would act as if the past was more real than the here and now when this happened it was confusing because it wasnt logical my conscious mind couldnt make the connection between what i was feeling and what was happening why would losing weight trigger so much anxiety i would choose to eat how i didnt want to eat why would a friends tone cause me to want to run away from the relationship why would my childs behavior trigger me why would sitting down to create something my heart really wanted to create paralyze me why did i avoid doing the things i knew would make a difference in my life its really hard to make changes when you have something buried deep inside you that is not on board maybe its that you want to raise your children in a gentle peaceful environment but you keep losing your patience or you have important gifts to share with the world but you keep sabotaging your success maybe you have a strong desire to speak up but every time you go to say or write something you feel blocked or maybe its that you struggle every day to find the motivation or energy you need to make the changes happen and so you keep repeating the same unwanted patterns the sad thing is when we cant make the changes we want to make we blame ourselves we judge ourselves as weak or we see ourselves as less worthy or less capable than the people we see who are doing what we want to do or living how we want to live the reality is you cant force everything youre not weak or less than youre not missing some secret formula if youre like me forcing yourself to be different doesnt work those invisible forces will always win and youll continue to act in ways you dont really want to you have to deal with those invisible forces first so you can be in flow and then as if by magic the changes you want to make will just naturally become possible those invisible forces have power over us because our actions and behaviors are not determined by the conscious mind alone the part of your mind you are not conscious of that part where all your memories are stored has a really big influence on you it will activate memories without you realizing it and those memories will affect the way you feel the way you act and the way you think if youre really paying attention you will even notice when those unconscious memories step in and start to run your life it feels like something takes over and you watch yourself behave in ways you dont want to its so frustrating it is the opposite of flow when you are in flow everything lines up what you want to do and how you want to live line up with how you actually behave and the choices you are able to make theres no tension or stress there is just simply agreement i struggled with being out of flow for years and sometimes still do i knew who i was in my heart and how i wanted to live but i had a lot working against melike a lot a lot i had childhood traumas untended to for years i had a plethora of unhealed childhood wounds because i was a highly sensitive child raised in an emotionally neglectful environment its not my parents fault no one taught them how to meet my emotional needs because no one thought it was important and its been that way for generations no wonder i also had a lot of generational trauma to clear its like this for so many of us you cant live in flow when there are memories inside that start working against you but who has the time to work through every issue that could be causing pain instead of trying to work through every issue that needed healing i learned to use the super computer part of my brain or in other words my subconscious mind and get it to do the work for me its a brilliant method and one i use all the time now on myself and for my clients if youre wondering how this super computer part of your brain works imagine this imagine you had to pack up all the items in your house because you were moving but every time you go to pack something goes wrong you hurt your back or you break a something precious to you or every day you wake up and struggle to find the motivation to do packing and sorting that needs to be done then someone says why dont you just hire a moving company to help you so you make the call and this amazing team comes in and sorts through your stuff puts it in boxes does all the heavy lifting for you and hauls everything away and you think to yourself why did i wait so long to ask for help this was so easy your subconscious mind is like those movers it can do so much heavy lifting for you it can do what your conscious mind cant it can sort through all your memories gather up all the ones that relate to each other then decide exactly what to do with them so they no longer work against you its like hauling away the garbage of your past and only keeping what agrees with you now im not going to pretend this is a cureall solution because nothing ever is but it is  something you want to learn how to do because it saves so much time and there are some memories that can only be reached by the subconscious mind the conscious mind just doesnt have access to them most healing modalities work with the conscious mind in this new course im creating i teach you how to work with the subconscious mind and how to allow it to do the work for you the course is called the colors of spirit and body the gentle art of coming into agreement with yourself and if you are a parent the joy is the process i teach in this course is so easy you can do it with and for your young kids so you can help them clear those unconscious blocks before those blocks affect them in the same way your unconscious blocks affected you in the colors of spirit and body youll learn to identify the most urgent blocks to your flow are and ill teach you a simple method for clearing them ill also go over how to tell when its time to clear an unconscious block both for yourself and your children andor clients the colors of spirit and body is a  week online program all the lessons will be recorded so you can go over them when its right for you and you will be able to access the new material each week in my online classroom im currently looking for people who would like to take the course on a trial run basis you will receive the entire  week online course at a reduced rate of  regular cost is  in exchange for patience with me if it takes me longer to get the material out then i

"a review of how the roadmap bill got passed after some massaging by the massachusetts house this was written by long time eca member and environmental lawyer allan fierce
last three days of july
how massachusetts house passed the roadmap bill
by allan fierce eca massachusetts member
heading into the last week of july there was much uncertainty and concern about what would happen in the massachusetts house with rep joan meschino is  roadmap bill h the bill was eca massachusetts top legislative priority the focus of our lobbying and advocacy in  and  but with only a single week left in the legislative session this year there just did not appear to be time for the house ways and means committee house wm to report the roadmap bill to the full house the house to approve it and a housesenate conference committee to agree upon a single version of their competing climate bills many climate activists were urging legislators to extend their session beyond july  but house and senate leadership appeared reluctant to do this even though many important bills were awaiting final action early in the week anxiety continued to build among eca massachusetts and our climate allies
then suddenly it happened on wednesday july  at midday a page composite climate bill h emerged from house wm and was sent to the full house with a recommendation that it be passed
we later learned that this house wm bill actually had been put together by rep thomas a golden jr who is not on house wm but is trusted by house leadership to have the most expertise on state climate legislation it is not clear how this unusual special assignment came about or whether other legislators also played a role in drafting the bill
all eca members should be elated however because the initial five pages of this composite bill contained the original roadmap bill is essential provisions although the key action deadlines all were extended by one year the other parts of this composite bill if enacted would create a number of new climaterelated programs but despite being a composite bill it is titled an act creating a  roadmap to a clean and thriving commonwealth the same title as rep meschino is roadmap bill it is now being commonly referred to as the house roadmap bill
but there was no time to celebrate this development when the bill was released at midday on wednesday house members were given until only  pm that day to file any proposed amendments a mad scramble ensued as eca massachusetts members and other climate activists frantically called emailed and texted their reps all afternoon seeking sponsors for amendments they were backing by  pm a total of  proposed amendments had been filed among the proposed amendments that eca massachusetts supported was one that restored the key action deadlines in the meschino bill another amendment no  contained the language of the environmental justice ej bill supported by eca and many other climate activists
at midday on thursday the full house convened for the purpose of considering the roadmap bill and the  proposed amendments while this house session happened at the house chambers in the state house with a member of house leadership at the podium only a few legislators were present most house members attended virtually rep golden spoke first in person to introduce the bill describing its contents and thanking many members and staff who had played key roles in the bill is development he gave particular thanks to rep meschino for all she had done to promote the roadmap bill next to speak in person was rep meschino herself who gave a special thanks to speaker robert deleo for supporting the bill
thereafter the house proceeded all that afternoon and evening and all friday afternoon and evening to address the proposed amendments they did this however in a manner that is effectively opaque to the public while the public was able to view a live video stream of the nearlyempty house chambers all the real action took place behind the scene possibly in speaker deleo is office the person at the podium simply waited for long stretches for instructions from that inner sanctum from time to time there would be an announcement that a handful of specific amendments had been withdrawn how those withdrawals came about was never made clear but also from time to time the person at the podium would announce a vote on an amendment that apparently had been cleared for passage by those in the back room that vote occurred not with a roll call of the members but in a manner of seconds when the rep at the podium asked for the ayes and nays and then immediately announced that the ayes have it and pounded his gavel
sadly the amendment that would have restored the key deadlines in the meschino bill was unceremoniously withdrawn we have no idea why rep golden and house leadership wanted to extend these deadlines by a full year which eca considers a totally unnecessary extension and one the climate can ill afford
the final amendment to be dealt with late on friday was the ej amendment which sought to add the ej bill to the house roadmap bill but it was clear that it had been approved in advance by the inner sanctum because for this amendment speaker deleo himself emerged to take over at the podium and there were half a dozen speakers who came to the podium to thank the speaker and others for their support for this longneeded bill some including including reps adrian madaro and michelle m dubois spoke movingly about their own families being impacted by air and water pollution while they were growing up following these endorsements the amendment was allowed a real roll call vote of all the members and it was adopted  this is great news
moments later as the clock approached  pm the entire house roadmap bill as amended was given a full roll call vote and it passed with a vote of 
the other key development that occurred late in the week is that the house and senate agreed to extend the legislative session until the end of the year this means that there is now time for a conference committee of the house and senate to attempt to reconcile the senate is nextgen climate bill with the house is composite roadmap bill eca will attempt to monitor these developments closely to ensure that the  roadmap bill is included in any compromise bill recommended by the conference committee however conference committees do not meet publicly so monitoring their work is not easy and when a conference committee does release a bill it is not subject to amendment approval requires an affirmative vote by both chambers
stay tuned the saga of the  roadmap bill continues
for more information about the bill as passed by the house and incorporating the adopted amendments which is now h see this overview by eca massachusetts arnie epstein you can also access the overview from the featured post about the roadmap bill on the home page at the eca massachusetts website",1
jesus is coming over the last decade many endtime scholars have predicted the imminent rapture of the church they firmly believed that the rapture would occur on this day and time or that and let people know that jesus would come immediately they were wrong surprised by their inaccurate assessment i asked jesus where they were off he told me that the reason is that he doesnt even know when the rapture will happen he told me that the day of rapture is determined  by the fulfillment of complex prophecies and very importantly the behavior of mankind in modern business terms it is based on a series of uncontrollable variables the scriptures they based their pronouncements were not incorrect nor were the connection they made to current events that instigated their predictions all of the prophetic promises are fulfilled one prophecy that has been dramatically fulfilled is that damascus will be laid waste it certainly has been i have bible student friends who have stated that jesus will not return until god has made the evil one and all of jesus is enemies his footstool they base their beliefs primarily on two scriptures psalm  and corinthians  from king david a prophet and a god described man after my own heart the lord god says to my lord the messiah sit at my right hand until i make your adversaries your footstool from the apostle paul appointed by god the father god the son and god the holy spirit to be the teacher to all nonjewish people for jesus must be king and reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet jesus did both of those things when he rose from the dead and became the king of kings and lord of lords so what is the holdup every generation including the first since jesus ascended to heaven has believed that they would be the one to be raptured why has not jesus come yet to understand this one must understand the differences between god is time and our time earth time does not exist it is merely an estimation based on a presumption that a second is a second seconds are manmade measuring devices and nothing more they have no basis in fact that is why einstein is theory that energy equals mass times the speed of light squared emcis flawed it is only accurate in the sense of relativity god does not use time god does not have time time is irrelevant to god think about this revelation to the wisest man who ever or will ever live solomon from the holy spirit that which is now already has been and that which is to be already has been and god seeks that which has passed ecclesiastes  meaning the past the present and the future are all the same no time actually exists but this present moment that is why the expression in god is time is so foolish god operates at speeds we can not comprehend and thinks in ways that are beyond the capacity of our limited minds to understand many wrongheaded atheists claim to base their unbelief on the absurdity of the concept that god created everything in six human days even more wrongheaded teachers of believers stand on the theory that god actually created the earth in six earth days many believers believe that god created everything literally in six man designated days what is absurd is for us to try to measure god is time to god a day could be a trillion human years we have no way to know we do have an example of god is time that jesus exhibited in an incident during a storm on the sea of galilee but jesus said to them it is i be not afraid then they were quite willing and glad for him to come into the boat and now the boat went at once to the land they had steered toward and immediately they reached the shore toward which they had been slowly making their way john  more than once jesus used molecular transformation that caused him or things to move at the speed of thought once a crowd of outraged jews tried to throw jesus off of a high cliff he vanished right in front of their eyes god jesus god the father and god the holy spirit move immediately and their thoughts are far above the most genius of us all read this declaration from god the father and meditate on it keep it close to you use it to share with others who do not understand the events of the bible or think that they are smarter than god it was spoken to the prophet isaiah by god himself let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts and let him return to the lord and he will have love pity and mercy for him and to our god for he will multiply to him his abundant pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways says the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain and snow come down from the heavens and return not there again but water the earth and make it bring forth and sprout that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth it shall not return to me void without producing any effect useless but it shall accomplish that which i please and purpose and it shall prosper in the thing for which i sent itisaiah  two crucial facts are declared in that message our thoughts are not on the level of god is thoughts no matter how much common sense we have or how high our iq is are it is impossible to think on the level of god whose mind is infinite with our finite brains it is impossible for any human to out think god it is quite impossible for any human to be smarter than god think about this question how can the creation be greater than the creator how can the cdc who hhi doctors know more about the human body and its healing process than the god who created it i am leading up to a point hang with me here you will soon understand as you read this know that james peter and john had just seen jesus in his heavenly glory just as he looks now walking and talking with elijah and moses on the mount of transfiguration yet they couldnt muster enough belief to use the power that jesus had given them to heal the sick please at some time soon read and meditate on the story of the transfiguration of jesus matthew it is amazing there is actually a church named the church of transfiguration on the top of mount tabor in israel the actual location of the transfiguration is debatable but the news report is not watch their unbelief in action which is a portrait of what is happening right this very moment and when they approached the multitude a man came up to him kneeling before him and saying lord do pity and have mercy on my son for he has epilepsy and he suffers terribly for frequently he falls into the fire and many times into the water and i brought him to your disciples and they were not able to cure him and jesus answered o you unbelieving warped wayward rebellious and thoroughly perverse generation how long am i to remain with you how long am i to bear with you bring him here to me and jesus rebuked the demon the disease of epilepsy in jesus walk on earth all diseases were believed to be demons and if you think about it they are and it came out of him and the boy was cured instantly another example of god moving at the speed of thoughtthen the disciples came to jesus and asked privately why could we not drive it out he said to them because of the littleness of your faith for truly i say to you if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed you can speak to this mountain move from here to yonder place and it will move and nothing shall be impossible for you matthew  jesus replied have faith in god  i assure you and most solemnly say to you whoever says to this mountain be lifted up and thrown into the sea and does not doubt in his heart but believes that what he says is going to take place it will be done for him  for this reason i am telling you whatever things you ask for in prayer believe that you have received them and they will be given to you mark  this declaration that we have the power to speak things in or out of existence ie corona virus was so important for us to know that jesus taught it twice in different instances a mustard seed is the smallest of all seeds remember that at that time jesus had not finished his work and had not left men his faith now we have the faith of jesus if we make him our king then they had to rely on their flesh faith their natural belief system and the disciples did not believe jesus even after he had given them the authority to heal sickness and had demonstrated to them how to use it the disciples had an excuse we do not their inability to summon enough belief to cast out the demon of epilepsy made jesus angry he was not angry with them as much as he was with the spirit of unbelief that they had allowed to overcome them he called them many negative names jesus did not punish them he was not speaking to them he was speaking to the spirit of unbelief jesus sternly rebuked that spirit jesus is words are very prophetic they were not spoken to that generation alone but ours as well the thing that drives god to anger is unbelief because it is something that even he can not change jesus has told me many times that our job is to lead the horse to water not to shove his head in and make him drink that is a decision a choice that the horse must make alone just as we must make a decision to believe or not believe read this question slowly and intently answer the question in your mind o you unbelieving warped wayward rebellious and thoroughly perverse generation how long am i to remain with you how long am i to bear with you fast forward to today we are faced with the chinese virus in my opinion and it is only my opinion backed by logic and news reports from among others the new york post  bible bro and the daily news is that corona virus was created in a chinese laboratory and fueled by ignorance of the word of god and the collective unbelief of believers the level of unbelief we are seeing today is astonishing the ignorance is heartrending how could the teachers of the gospel of jesus have failed so miserably to teach their flocks that disease is powerless in the body of those who know and believe jesus how is it that billions of believers all over the world do not know or believe that jesus destroyed every disease known and unknown to man by dying from them all once for all on the crossisaiah  matthew  peter psalm peter john  how is it that billions of believers all over the world do not know or believe that jesus gave us the same power that he used to raise the dead heal every disease and do miracles of all kindsjohn how is it that billions of believers all over the world do not know that jesus gave us the power to speak and command diseases to dry up and disappear how are they ignorant that they have the authority to bind anything especially diseases on earth and in heaven from attacking them mark  and matthew  how can jesus is sheep not know that because jesus threw satan to earth and gave us dominion over all evil that nothing shall in anyway is harm you luke  how do you suppose jesus who died from coronavirus and every other disease on the cross so that we have the power to choose not ever to be sick feels right now how must our dear jesus who loved us so much that he died from our diseases feel as he watches his bloodbought sheep cowering in their homes at the demand of secular politicians and unbelieving scientists who just know that they are smarter and more powerful than god i must address the ubiquitous question that comes every time i teach that jesus destroyed disease well pastor allen if jesus killed coronavirus and all diseases why are there so many dying in hospitals why are there hospitals at all the answer is the collective unbelief of the people what would have happened if when this scourge was released a majority of people knew and believed without a doubt that jesus destroyed it on the cross and further that he bought us the power to do the same here is the answer from an eyewitness matthew the disciple who was with jesus in his home town of capernaum where this incident occurred at the time jesus grew up there and they knew him as a native carpenter apprentice and journeyman they knew his mother and brothers and sisters they could not believe that he was god even after all of his mighty works and miracles had become well known and they took offense at him they were repelled and hindered from acknowledging his authority and caused to stumble but jesus said to them a prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house and he did not do many works of power there because of their unbeliefmatthew  today believers are ashamed of the gospel of jesus especially those who call themselves apostles prophets pastors evangelists and preachers they like nicodemus are horrified at the prospect of what would happen if they dared preach the truth they are petrified by the fear of what their congregants might do if they spoke the truth of jesus instead of believing jesus and his promises and fearlessly teaching them they lock up their churches and tell their flocks to stay at home astonishing church should be the first place believers who are sick should go but for the unbelief of the leader and the congregants how can they preach the great and precious promises of jesus when they do not believe them because they have refused to teach the truth their flocks are now living in danger and in hell on earth just as in his walk on earth jesus is teachings offend them a leader could lose his income his status his country club membership his multimillion dollar mansion his spot on trinity broadcasting his giant gaudy and superfluous building and all that he holds dear for teaching the words of jesus please if you think i am being too hard on the irresponsible leaders of the church please read the twenty third chapter of matthew im tough on them but my boss called them sons of hell really how do you think god the father is dealing with all of this surely he is employing his incomprehensible mercy surely god has forgiven our unbelief surely he weeps for us surely his heart is broken to watch his people fear and die from this disease surely god grieves our ignorance and unbelief how long will he remain with us how long will he endure our disrespect how often will he allow his children to break his heart jesus said that the endtimes would be like the days of noah he gave the pagan worshippers of noah is day one hundred and twentyfive years to turn away from their false gods to him how many years in human terms has man rejected the teaching of jesus some will think it crazy that i talk to jesus all day every day if so they should read the tenth chapter of john i do two nights ago he made a simple statement and it was the happiest promise of all i am coming for you he did not say how when or wherejust those exact words frankly i believe that god may have had enough knowing him i believe that there will be a short time after this disgraceful behavior when his grace and mercy cause him to hesitate a bit to see if there is a turn away from hedonistic guidance to him and his word some call it repentance i pray that this is so when we stand before jesus whether that is today or tomorrow or when we die what will we report to him will we say that we stood fast believing and sharing his words and blessings without fear never wavering regardless of the thoughts of others will we say that while others lost their heads and blamed us that we kept ours as rudyard kipling wrote in the poem if you can however believe this jesus is coming please be courageous for our king pass this teaching to as many as possible dont worry about what others will think of you glory to god in the highest

many years ago the city of san antonio de bexar was part of spain is empire in the americas and in the year  spanish tejas became mexican tejaswhen mexico achieved independence from spain so at that moment in history san antonio de bexar became part of a brand new countrymexico and in less than  years spanish families from tejas now called tejanos and recent anglo residents of tejasplanned to break away and rebelagainst this new country of mexico   this was the beginning of texas liberty and independence andindependence came at a cost many men and womenboth anglos and tejanosgave and sacrificed so muchsometimes everything for this texas independence cause today we remember and honor individuals of that rebellionnames who are forever etched in our minds as texas heroesmen like sam houstonjim bowiecol traviscapt james fanninstephen f austindavid crockettalmaron dickinson and james bonham those are the names that always come to mindbut history would ask youwho was juan seguin and what did he personally contribute lose or risk to insure texas freedom sovereignty and independence juan nepomuceno segu��n aka juan segu��n was born in  in san antonio de bexar new spain now san antonio texasto a wealthy san antonio ranching family juan was a revolutionary and politician who helped establish the independence of texas andjuan was from san antoniohis family had a house near the plaza of san fernando on nueva streetand his family had a beautiful hacienda at their ranch near what is now floresvillecalledcasa blanca juans great paternal grandfatherbartolomeoarrived in san antonio soon after the city was founded in making the seguins one of the first families to settle in this new city of san antonio de bexar juans fathererasmo segu��njos�� antonio navarro and juan martin de veramendiwere the prominent spanish elite gentlemen of san antonio that were appointed by the spanish governorto be instrumental in aiding moses austin firstthen later stephen austin with the installation and settlement of the ol  familiesthe actual first  families to legally settle in texasin some of the most beautiful land that god has ever created in east texas these spanish gentlemen welcomed their new anglo neighbors into their land in mexican tejasmany individuals in san antonioincluding juan segu��nwanted tejas to be its own mexican state and sided with stephen austin who wanted autonomy of this region as a teenager in mexico juan had a strong interest in politicsin juan segu��n was elected alderman in san antonio de bexarat the age of and became the mayor of san antonio in  but by political tensions escalated between the mexican governmentand both the anglos and tejanos in texasand both groups objected to mexican pres antonio l��pez de santa annas harsh regime so the anglos and the tejanos decided to stand united against mexico in  segu��n formed the now famous tejano volunteer company and recruited and commanded fighting men for the texian army this military unit consisted entirely of juans friends from san antonio and surrounding areasfriends like the flores brothers his brothers in law gregorio esparza manuel leal and cristoval de arciniega at the start of the texas war for independence stephen f austin commissioned juan segu��n a captain in the new texian armyand was given the task of supplying the texian troopswith food and provisions what does that mean because the segu��n isand the other prominent elite families had money and resourcesthe texian army asked juan segu��n to organize and secure food supplies rifles horses wagons and other necessary items for the new texian army of freedom fighters that was forming juan then sent out scouting parties tejanos knew the area to the missions of san antonio in search of a suitable and safe base camp for the texians so by the fall of just two years after taking the office of alcalde of san antonioa young capitanjuan segu��n was feeding supplying securing and finding safe shelterfor a newly organized texian resistance force now the stage is set for the birthing of a new nation from october  to april  battles would take place in texas that would determine the final outcome of the war it seems that history would put juan segu��n right smack in the middle of all major historical battles and events juan had a front row seat toand personally witnessthe birthing of this new nationtexas juan segu��n bravely fought in and participated in all of the following historical events juan segu��n participated in the battle of concepcion along with texian leader and personal friendcolonel jim bowieand captain james fannin juan also fought at the seige of bexar where texians and tejanoscaptured the city san antonio de bexarfrom general santa annas brotherinlawgeneral perfecto de cos juan segu��n was also a defender at the alamoalong with eight of his tejano friends he would lose good friends there he escaped death because travis sent him out as a messenger to gonzalesright before the alamo fell after the alamojuans orders for his tejano volunteer unitfrom general houston were to guard the rear of the retreating texian army during what is now called the runaway scrape many times the segu��n is fighting tejanos engaged advance units of the mexican armyto keep the retreating texian army safe segu��n is men knew the area well for guerrilla type defensive warfare history remembers a young capitan juan segu��n at a historic battle juan was part of the texian force led by general sam houston at the highly successful battle of san jacinto near modern day houston texas juan led his tejano volunteer company about  fighting tejanos at that battle this tejano military unit successfully charged and attacked the enemies right flank after the battledefeated general antonio lopez de santa anna personally surrendered texas to general sam houston and santa anna thensurrendered the city san antonio de bexar to nowlt colonel juan segu��n andjust like thattexas was born texas patriot juan segu��n was just shy of his th birthday in  short years after the battle of san jacintosan antonio de bexar had changed from being predominantly tejano to becoming predominantly anglo the new arrivals of anglos now outnumbered the local tejanos  to  the best way to describe the relationship between the tejanos and the anglos in san antonio after the war for texas independence wasnot good it seemed then in like just yesterday that texians and tejanos were in the fight of their livesfighting sidebysideagainst a common enemy in juan segu��n was once again elected mayor of san antonio de bexarbutsome of the newly arrived anglo population did not know or care who juan segu��n wasand the others had forgotten imagine this headline on a san antonio newspaper of the time wealthy ranchertexas patriotand mayor of san antoniojuan segu��n forced to abandon his mayoral post and relocate his family to mexico due to deadly threats this new country texas was not ready to allow tejano participation in governmentoh yessegu��n was elected as a texas senator from  to  and worked closely with congressman jos�� antonio navarro to ensure legislation that would be in the best interest of citizens of spanish decent in texas who were quickly becoming the political minority but that soon change in  when juan segu��n was forced by his enemies to leavebecause there was a new sayinga popular sloganbeing circulated among the population of san antonio de bexarand repeated everywheretexas for texans andthat did not include juan segu��n or his family so he was forced to leave texas with his familyand live among his enemies in mexico san antonio texasonce a spanish villathen a mexican cuidadthen a tejano citywould not see another hispanic mayor for  years the next hispanic mayor of this tricentennial city would be elected in his namehenry cisneros after the mexican american war in juan seguin is finally given permission to return to floresville casa blancabut there were no parades waiting for juanor invitations to be honored in austin or san antonio as a living hero of the texas revolution only the city that bears his

we were told the cyclone was going to be bad but i do not think anyone really understood just how bad until it hit with a force its hard to understand if you did not experience it first hand kolkata is not exactly known for its strong and robust infrastructure and so when a storm of this magnitude bears down on the city it creates unprecedented havoc the gale force winds tore thousands of trees out of the ground and sent them hurling into homes and shops in many ways these trees are the backbone of the city and provide most of the shade that helps cool down the city during the intense heat of summer they help provide fresh oxygen nutrients for the soil and suck up large quantities of pollution from the air with so many ripped from the ground the long term effects will be felt in ways we cannot yet imagine the torrential rain assisted by the winds flooded streets businesses slums homes and even somehow managed to reach flats over  stories high through exhaust vents window ac is and elevator shafts it was shocking to witness and is a strong reminder to never underestimate mother nature
as is always the case those less fortunate both people and animals have suffered the most people living in low lying areas in slums in poorly made structures consisting of one maybe two rooms have lost their homes and most of their possessions birds were killed by the thousands an unknown number of dogs and cats have drowned or been severely injured by falling debris many will not get the help they need because noone can reach them or even find them the animal people alliance team will be doing its best to help as many as possible with the limited staff it has available most staff are unable to travel to work due to lockdown but we are fortunate to have volunteers in the area that are committing to helping
as the days go on we learn more and more just how devastating the storm has been for the city and the region the economic toll for kolkata alone has been estimated at  billion a figure that represents about  of its gdp the death toll in the city is nearing  with surely more to come it will be a long road ahead especially as we also deal with the reality of the coronavirus kolkata and all of west bengal will overcome these challenges i have no doubt about that the people of the city are determined and strong and know how to deal with adversity better than most i hold out hope that an even stronger kolkata will emerge from the destruction and start to realize its true potential with your help i have no doubt that will be the case above text from animalpeoplealliance
help animals india is helping several groups and individuals throughout kolkatta at this difficult time we are sending through animal people alliance and also pariah dog films pariahdogfilm who are intimately familiar with kolkatta to distribute to the best rescuers here is one shelter devastated we are helping more photos here
please send any amount here to help as much as we all can",1

dear austin community we are taking steps to ensure the welfare of our office and staff at west end chiropractic the reason we have not closed and have no plans to at this time is that chiropractic is considered an essential health care service the  thing we all must work towards is keeping the er urgent care and medical care as clear and open as possible chiropractic plays a huge role in doing that it is been proven that chiropractic care can reduce the need for some types medical care so that is crucial right now since the  reason for adults to visit the er is severe musculoskeletal pain and issues we remain here to limit that many of you your friends your coworkers need help with any number of health care challenges from the lower back pain the neck pain the headaches and all the new pains developing from working from home all of a sudden some of you cannot get into your usual doctors offices as they are caring for the corona virus patients or you have been told what you have is not an emergency i understand that this is a tense time we are here to help you i have been a part of this community for many years and having been born and raised here i have never felt a stronger time to do what i can no we are not taking anyone even suspecting themselves of having the virus but we are gladly opening our doors to all the rest of you have literally nowhere to go and feel like you have been put aside we have put in play every procedure possible from the cdc the state and our own to ensure our staff stays healthy and so do our patients and community during this time lets all do our part to combat what we can control and keep using chiropractic to keep your body functioning and feeling as best it can feed your body the good stuff more greens less processed  sugary foods cut way back on dairy get plenty of exercise and outdoors even if your workouts go from the gym to home or happen in the home itself movement is so calming to your brain  great to boost your immune system make sure to break a sweat because that is how our body gets things moving on out manage your stress levels in times like this our stress levels skyrocket stress is known to cause many illnesses and will only dramatically decrease our bodys ability to fight amidst all the unknown and chaos right now try and find peace meditate stay away from social media show love and stay calm get plenty of restful sleep your body requires large amounts of energy so it depends on adequate sleep to function at full capacity and of course wash your hands if we can decrease the burden on the health care system to allow them to do what they do best then we have done our job i look forward to serving you helping you and getting our community back sincerely dr casey morgan,1

"the following is a partial repost of my article that suddenly has been taken out of circulation because of the picture and later for length here is the meaty part of the article for your consideration
let us take a brief look at hb  a bill currently before the house of representatives and referred to the house committee on energy and commerce according to legiscan it is
covid testing reaching and contacting everyone trace act this bill authorizes the centers for disease control and prevention cdc to award grants for testing contact tracing monitoring and other activities to address covid ie coronavirus disease  entities such as federally qualified health centers nonprofit organizations and certain hospitals and schools are eligible to receive such grants in awarding the grants the cdc shall prioritize applicants that  operate in hot spots and medically underserved communities and  agree to hire individuals from the communities where grant activities occur
we learn this about hb  from congress official text of the bill on congress gov
to authorize the secretary of health and human services to award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for covid and related activities such as contact tracing through mobile health units and as necessary at individuals residences and for other purposes
a citizen might ask questions like is the cdc constitutional where in the constitution does it legally and explicitly authorize this government agency are they allowed to give grants for such activities like going to individual residences as they deem necessary what does the phrase for other purposes mean what are those purposes will i be able to refuse a visit from those who receive these grants if the bill passes what is the cost to me the taxpayer
yes there are lots of questions you might ask on the other hand you may yawn at all of this legislative jargon they are your rights and those of your posterity that are at stake people often write to me and say that we need to keep congress accountable this is one way to do it
the life we aspire to depends on the type of government we have it is essential now more than ever to be informed
this is common sense civics and citizenship

receiving and believing our prophet and priest part  for i have given to them the words which you have given me and they have received them and have known surely that i came forth from you and they have believed that you sent me john  the people of israel had no valid excuse for their rejection of the lord jesus christ for they reveled in the prophecies of the messiahs glorious establishment of a physical reign on the earth however they utterly ignored the vit  al passages concerning the truth that messiah would be pierced for our transgressions and crushed for our iniquities of course they should have received and believed these truths for they were extremely familiar with the history of the sacrificial system of the ceremonial law yet they ignored these monumental prophecies concerning the suffering servant instead they focused on a physical kingdom which they imagined would usher in an age of universal peace and the end of all hatred suffering oppression and disease furthermore they should have received and believed the lord jesus because of the overwhelming evidence of the power of his countless miracles and signs however the religious leaders and many of their followers attributed jesus miracles to the power of beelzebub and yet do you recall the moment when the disciples of john the baptist came to the lord from john asking are you the coming one or do we look for another the lord jesus answered that question with these words go and tell john the things you have seen and heard that the blind see the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf hear the dead are raised the poor have the gospel preached to them and blessed is he who is not offended because of me additionally the preparation ministry of john the baptist should have alerted everyone in israel to the coming of the messiah for john was an extraordinary prophet who gained national notoriety so much so that the leaders of the nation sent an official delegation to ask him if he was the messiah but on the following day john the baptist pointed to the lord jesus christ and declared behold the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world every person who heard the words of the prophet should have immediately heeded johns testimony and received and believed the lord jesus christ and yet in the midst of all this overwhelming darkness obstinate resistance and willful ignorance this minuscule band of men both received the truth that jesus words were directly from heaven and they believed that the lord had come directly from heaven in the midst of all of these hard hearts superficial hearts and worldly hearts the seed of the word had supernaturally been implanted into the hearts of this paltry circle of people the world would tell you that seeing is believing however the lord jesus turned that statement upside down and declared that believing is seeing in speaking to martha previous to the resurrection of her brother lazarus the lord said to her did i not say to you that if you would believe you would see the glory of god there were some who responded in hardhearted rejection there were others who responded with a superficial and temporary faith which finally walked away still others counted the cost of true conversion and chose to cling to their worldly idols friend each one of these who refused to repent and believe the gospel were personally responsible for their rebellion and yet on the eve of his crucifixion the lord jesus christ could confidently pray that three remarkable miracles had occurred in the hearts and minds of these  disciples they had willingly received and embraced the incredible truths that jesus had taught them they had received and believed the astounding truth that their master had come directly from the throne of heaven they had both received and believed the majestic truth that the lord jesus was the christ the son of the living god and all of their receiving and believing had taken place while the massive majority of their countrymen had neither received nor believed anything of the kind yes as we observe these men they exhibited many flaws and failures in their faith but when we consider the extremely difficult position that they were living in and the fierce opposition that surrounded them it is no light matter that they received and believed on the lord jesus christ and friend neither is it a light matter in our case as we walk by faith in the midst of this collapsing culture for even though our faith also displays many flaws and failures we have a great high priest who is continually commending us before the father,1

"my comments on extending school opening
as the parent of a year  child at a local primary school and a toddler at a local nursery i want to be confident that my children and all children in st helens borough as well as those who teach and care for them are returning to a safe environment we all want our children is education and enjoyment of normal school life to resume but this cannot be done at the expense of their health and safety nor that of teachers and other staff working in our schools
many of our schools have been open throughout this crisis and i thank all those headteachers teachers and staff who have provided support for vulnerable children and ensured that key workers have been able to continue in their vital work
unfortunately the government is approach to this announcement as it has been with their wider communication of how we move forward has been muddled and exacerbated anxiety and concerns it has been made clear that the reopening of schools is dependent on a number of factors a lowering of coronavirus cases a national plan for social distancing tests available for staff and pupils for each school to have planned for the safety of all and a plan to protect vulnerable teachers
i have been working with my labour colleagues and frontbench education team to urge the government to work collaboratively with trade unions who i have been in direct contact with and parents organisations to identify and address issues within schools before the government finally confirms a date for their reopening
i have visited a local school st cuthbert is high school in parr to see for myself how schools might move towards opening up to more pupils when safe to do so it is challenging to say the least thank you to mrs twist and her excellent team for facilitating this i have also written to all schools within the constituency asking them their views on the proposed increase in pupils attending
additionally i have worked closely with st helens council and commend the cabinet member responsible for education cllr sue murphy for working closely with schools engaging with local trade unions and supporting headteachers in the decisions they come to it is also important that in these early stages parents who are concerned and choose not to send their children to school because of concerns they have are not penalised
we have many fantastic schools across st helens borough our headteachers and governing bodies will act in the best interests of pupils staff parents and the wider community they will have my full support and confidence in making these decisions in the difficult weeks and months ahead",1

"is sex work work or exploitation sex work or sexual exploitation
changhua county is planning to establish a legal red light district which has caused divisions in public opinion proponents argue that since the sex work industry already exists it is best to provide sex workers with a safe environment under the supervision of competent authorities they also mentioned the lack of job opportunities in changhua in southern taiwan and that sex work can provide women with no other means of earning a living wage sex trade zone some people claim that only  of sex workers in taiwan are from human trafficking and it is rare to enter sex work through human trafficking so most sex workers choose to join the sex work industry
the source of this statistic is unknown but from lixin is past experience this is just the tip of the iceberg there are thousands of forms of exploitation they are often hidden beneath the surface or in gray areas on the fringes of the law the us state department is trafficking in persons report section for taiwan states that  of the aliens accused of illegal immigration last year were identified as victims of human trafficking  of them were victims of sex trafficking
lixin has over  years of experience protecting sex workers providing sheltered placements other direct services and advocating for sex workers rights we stand with sex workers and are committed to their dignity and safety however we believe that sexual activity should not be classified as work no woman will choose to engage unless sexually abducted enticed coerced framed extorted financially difficult or otherwise circumstantial sex work for example some women are lured into paying off their debts through prostitution simply because they have taken out loan sharks and failed to pay the expensive interest on time
lixin disagrees that legal sex work and governmentregulated brothels will protect women experiences in germany and other countries where prostitution is legal show that the number of illegal prostitution cases or trafficking of women increases in both the regulated red light districts and other areas outside the regulated areas lixin also doesnt think there are other opportunities to earn a living in the changhua area we call on the government to dedicate resources to provide equal job opportunities for women
we know that because men who are willing to pay for prostitutes have a sexual need there is a supply of the sex work industry some of them have disabilities orphans or other reasons however this is still not the right thing to do we have to look at this issue from a gender standpoint in the context of patriarchy the exploitation of women the commodification of women and other factors
this is a difficult and complex social issue and there are strong arguments for both sides lixin looks forward to more indepth and constructive discussions in the future to help taiwanese society reach a consensus and gain a deeper understanding of this issue
see moregender issuessex work is not work but exploitation
sex work is not work sex work is exploitation penalty for whoring but not prostitution
investment in employment resources for disadvantaged women
changhua county is plan to set up a red light district has split opinion proponents of the proposal argue that sex work exists so it is better that sex workers are given a safe environment where there is supervision and oversight by the authorities they also say changhua in south taiwan lacks economic opportunities so sex work gives women who have no other way of supporting themselves a valuable income
some argue that since few sex workers are trafficked the majority do it by choice others say there is a need for a sex zone among men who are unmarried widowed disabled or husbands of wives who are ill
among feminist groups in taiwan there are differences of opinion on whether to legalize abolish decriminalize or prohibit prostitution
at the garden of hope firstly we stand by the women sex workers and defend their dignity and safety we have been at the forefront of protecting sex workers for over  years providing shelter and other direct services and advocating for their rights
however we do not think that sex should be classified as work it is not a career path that any young woman would consider taking unless she was forced by grooming enticement coercion entrapment extortion economic hardship or other environmental factors
even though only a small minority are physically forced we do not agree that any woman goes into prostitution by choice
for example we know of cases of women who have borrowed money from loan sharks found themselves falling behind on the high interest rates and have then been enticed into prostitution as a way to get themselves out of debt
supporters of changhua is red light district claim only  of sex workers are trafficked in taiwan we dont know where this figure comes from but in our experience this would only be the tip of the iceberg exploitation takes many different forms and is often hidden under the surface or in a grey area on the margins of the law
the us state department is trafficking in person is tip report on taiwan says last year  trafficking victims were identified among foreigners accused of immigration violations including  sex trafficking victims
we doubt that legalizing sex work and regulating brothels will protect women the experience of germany and other countries that have legalized prostitution has been an increase in illegal prostitution outside the regulated red light districts and more trafficking of women
we also do not accept there are no other viable job opportunities in changhua we urge the government to invest in employment to give women equal work we understand that supply is created by demand for sex from men who are willing to pay for it some of whom may be disabled widowed or have other good reasons however that doesnt make it right
we need to look at this issue from a gendered perspective and in the context of the patriarchy exploitation of women commodification of women is bodies and other factors
this is a difficult and complex issue with strong arguments on both sides we would like to see more informed and constructive dialogue on this question to help build consensus and understanding in taiwanese society

the north carolina supreme courts decision to review cases under the nc racial justice act rja recently the nc supreme court decided to review three important cases brought under north carolinas racial justice act which allowed inmates on death row to challenge their sentences if racial bias was a factor in a prosecutors decision to seek or in a jurys decision to impose the death penalty extensive scientific studies and analyses were conducted which determined that pr  osecutors in north carolina routinely struck qualified black jurors from serving on juries if a defendant was black and the victim was white at a rate of more than  to  in addition if a defendant was black and the victim was white it was determined that prosecutors were  to  times more likely to seek the death penalty if an inmate was successful in an appeal under the rja it wasnt equivalent to a get out of jail free card instead an inmate was resentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole please review the attached article which i wrote relating to the nc supreme court decision to review cases decided under the rja before the law was repealed by the republican majority in the nc general assembly,1

my name is steve silberman and i am an american citizen  nothing more but nothing less i am just like you as a boy in alabama i was taught early on that it is my duty as a citizen to speak out should anything or anyone put this country in jeopardy when i was a young man i took an oath to support and defend the constitution so it is with rising alarm that now as a grown man and for the record i write with full conviction that i believe that the united states is in g  reat and immediate danger a danger of a type we have never experienced before as a country we have allowed a damaged and unstable person to become the president of the united states it is written that the presidency will reveal a mans character whatever kind of person one was before public life is amplified exponentially and so is the potential to do good or to do bad think about who the president was as a civilian think about the bad faith dealings and the petty and unnecessary meanness think about the vindictiveness and the bullying and the eager willingness to ruin anyone who didnt please him or let him win think about the women he now demonstrates almost on a daily basis that he is true to his nature still he is a man with insecurities so debilitating that he cultivates the constant reassurances of his enablers be they his beholden underlings or the lemmings in the crowd he remains that same childish person  only now with his own army both literally and politically and my childrens future in his hands we are constitutionally at the mercy of man who believes that if he says something it must be true a man with flaws so profound that our national peace of mind is being taken from us we cannot know on any day that critical decisions are being made in good faith on the peoples behalf my greatest fear now is that if hes having a bad day and his stress is too high and the right set of circumstances are presented anything could happen so please if you are worried as i am speak out and speak soon if you have a voice raise it if you have an arm wave it if you have a pen let it be known that you too are sounding the alarm shout it from the rafters that the crisis is here and it is now make people listen make people think make the congress understand that they each will ultimately be judged by how they respond in this time of urgent national risk so now it is in the cloud for my descendants to see that i was not willing to watch my country be changed to suit the purposes of just one man no one in a democracy is supposed to be that special if we dont stop this slowmotion disaster soon our country may have already seen its best days there will be a reckoning  a penalty that we all must pay for allowing such a person to run our country and the longer this goes on the worse it will be tremendous damage is already being done please consider the sacrifice of those who have died to protect our way of life and do something be a citizen it is your duty everything we hold dear is on the line what will your great grandchildren have to say about you,1

what is the middle and why is it important hello my name is jade and im just an average guy living in the purple state of colorado i grew up in minnesota and south dakota fired artillery for the army in oklahoma paid for college with the gi bill and lived on both coasts i have a purple extended family and live in a purple neighborhood i could go on but the point is ive seen a broad cross section of america ive had conversations with many good people about t  he virtues of different ideas and principles that end up falling on both sides of the purple divide i love america what we stand for and who we are but im also mad as hell im mad that weve been reduced to yelling at each other about the unequivocal rights and wrongs of blue or red we have lost our ability to talk about the middle and i want to try and do something about it this is my third post my first post all people are generally the same describe how this country is filled with  good people which sit on both sides of the purple divide my second post the center never changes but opinions and politics do define what the middle is and how our imperfect system creates change my goal is to look at things in different ways that will challenge both sides ill know if im staying true to this mission if the disagreements and hopefully discussion are coming from both sides based upon the comments in the first two posts ive succeeded the middle is important because they decide elections special interests and political strategists hate the middle because they have to win their vote every election theyve been systematically polarizing and dividing the country so the divided electorate is only voting for their team rather than a complicated set of ideas with many shades of gray the polarized process has pushed for candidates more extreme with each election cycle as they try to get their even more polarized sides into their corner this positive feedback cycle is destroying the power of the american electorates ability to work in its own best self interest this pages mission is to try to break that feedback loop and facilitate a conversation around the middle of politics here are some of the ground rules im imposing on myself to make the mission work ill talk about issues which are important to understand the middle will push the outside towards the middle or engage topics which create debate from each side its impossible to be unbiased but hopefully depending on the week you will see positions from different sides of the purple divide if my selfbias on a particular issue is such that i dont see value in the other side ill refrain from discussing it in this forum i plan to write one post a week with a  budget but will mostly depend on sharing to reach a broader audience here are some ground rules for those whom decide to participate in the comment section i love hearing your original thoughts and seeing respectful debate although i have the power to delete comments i will only do so if you are overtly disrespecting other participants or are intentionally trying to subvert the goals of the page additionally going forward i will delete any post that has a meme memes are ideas created by other people to propagate unoriginal thought and dont belong here im also looking for great ideas for future posts i hope youre looking forward to this experiment as much as i am justonedumbguy sometimes we disagree its ok thats the middle a weekly blog follow to subscribe please share,1

were glad to see that tim bernerslee properly honored as the father of the world wide web is taking action to curb the abuse of power by the big tech platforms however after years of espousing the false gospel of internet exceptionalism  a theory that for some reason the internet should be above the law  his change of heart is way overdue its true that bernerslee has warned of the potential for companies to act irresponsibly since at least  but where was he  while google and facebook built the mammoth platforms that scaled up these abuses it was the utopian view of the internet as an unmitigated force for good on the part of bernerslee and others that helped get us into this mess capitalizing on this the internet giant convinced legislators to absolve them from responsibility for misuse of their global networks now were all paying the price isnt it ironic that were sharing this message with you through facebook but where else would we go whether its search on google or social on facebook they have truly become gatekeepers on whom we all depend we appreciate bernerslee owning up to his regrets but we cant wait for him to achieve another utopian dream to solve it the internet here and now needs fixing before its too late,1

a new attack on the affordable care act obamacare recently senators lindsey graham bill cassidy dean heller and ron johnson drafted an amendment to hr  which was a bill passed by the republican majority in congress to repeal and replace the affordable care act obamacare this proposed amendment could be voted on by the senate as early as next week it has already been opposed in a letter drafted and sent to members of the us senate by  republican and  democratic  governors the bill would repeal the authority of states to cover medicaid expansion adults as of september st  it would also add an option for states to require work as a condition for medicaid eligibility for nonelderly adults who are not disabled or pregnant it would convert medicaid as we know it to a block grant program where funds would be provided to the states however states would receive far less funding than they do today it would also prohibit federal medicaid funding for planned parenthood clinics for at least  year the amendment as drafted is extremely controversial since it would undermine the financial integrity of the affordable care act and it would result in millions of people no longer being able to afford their health insurance it would eliminate the requirement for people to carry insurance and it would also eliminate any subsidies to those who might otherwise qualify for financial subsidies under the aca additionally it would allow states to increase the cost of coverage for those with preexisting conditions which could result in those persons no longer being able to afford to pay for health insurance last night jimmy kimmel a late night entertainer on abc tv who has an infant son who was born with a congenital heart defect which required expensive surgery to survive called senator bill cassidyrlouisiana out for being a sponsor of this amendment senator cassidy had previously publicly stated that any amendment which he would introduce would have to pass what he called the jimmy kimmel test which would mean that all children and infants would have the same opportunities that kimmels son received last night kimmel expressed his disappointment that cassidy had done just the reverse and that the proposed amendment had failed in providing four essential components which he articulated as being necessary for any health insurance which are  coverage for all no discrimination based on preexisting conditions lower premiums for middleclass families and  no lifetime caps unfortunately the proposed amendment fails the socalled jimmy kimmel test with a solid score of  please contact your us senators and ask them to defeat this amendment,1

"those who have built sweden deserve the best care and those who work in elderly care deserve good working conditions and secure employment
a major challenge in the work with covid is to prevent the spread of infection in elderly care here live the most fragile and those who run the greatest risk of becoming seriously ill if they become infected the recent reporting on what it looks like in many nursing homes around the country is terrible of course we do not yet have all the answers as to why this has happened but we can state that it is often an unsustainable situation for many employees and thus also a risk factor for the health of the elderly
one connection that has been noted is that the dwellings where infection has been found to a greater extent have had staff who worked despite the fact that they showed symptoms this is exactly the scenario the government has tried to avoid by removing the qualifying day lifting the employer is sick pay responsibility and removing the requirement for a medical certificate we have tried to give everyone the incentive for employees who show symptoms to stay at home here the employment conditions in elderly care are a key issue if you have a secure job it will be easier to take sick leave then you are not affected in the same way as you do when your entire livelihood depends on whether you can take the next session
elderly care staff need more trained colleagues more secure employment and employers who focus on their ability to do their jobs it is about the right to basic education further education fulltime jobs and work clothes but also about time to gain strength and the right to security at work
that is why i am glad that we are now making an increase in elderly care so that  employees in elderly care can be educated at the same time as they keep their salary and then get a permanent job more knowledgeable and permanently employed employees not only make it more attractive to work in elderly care it also gives more people a secure old age
more will need to be done to make elderly care safer it is the responsibility of every politician to see that need and do something about it we must always put welfare first so that society can stand strong both in crisis and after the crisis lenahallengren",1

part  of  we established hoo is woods raptor center in  one night my husband at the time and my children and i were sitting around this little campfire in the backyard one of my kids said whose woods is it mommy meaning does it belong to the birds or to us i said we all have to share it it was just so fitting that is how we came up with the name hoo is woods it started with a little red shed in my backyard which we quickly outgrew today we have a large b  uilding with a clinic numerous enclosures outbuildings aviaries and a large flight area for eagles my kids grew up with it when they had special projects at school they would ask mom can you bring an owl to class at first it was pretty cool but it is like having a dog the first dog it is exciting and fun and then it just becomes part of everyday life but i think my children really see value in what we do i started out as a rehabilitator and then i took on three education birds the birds we use for public education are nonreleasable because of a physical or psychological impairment they cant survive in the wild the us fish and wildlife service and the wisconsin dnr allow them to be used for public education programs and exhibits to teach about their natural history biology and conservation i really wanted to get into educating people because i felt so passionate about the birds ive been doing educational programs for  years now today i have  trained education birds for our programs we are considered to have one of the top collections in the state we speak to a lot of children we visit a lot of schools libraries conservation clubs senior citizen groups and more in our presentations we talk about where raptors and wildlife fall into the ecosystem and how they benefit the world we talk about the birds individually so that people learn about their biology and the historical side of them the hazards like ddt and lead poisoning we talk about how to encourage habitat preservation and what happens when we dont like the example of the barn owl we have not had a nesting pair of barn owls in  years in wisconsin due to loss of grassland habitat in  the wisconsin wildlife federation called me and said congratulations you are wildlife conservationist of the year literally you could have knocked me over with a feather i thought me really seriously they invited me up to this award ceremony it was very humbling and i was very honored to be there the award says in recognition for your outstanding accomplishments in making a significant contribution to wildlife resources in wisconsin during the past years as a result of our programs over the years we have had groups that have made kestrel nesting boxes or screech owl boxes or just wanted to restore habitat or do something to help the environment even if it is going out and picking up trash on the roadsides its so amazing when a kid comes up to you after a presentation and says i want to be a biologist i want to work with birds i want to make a difference i want to help dianne moller  milton wi,1

major important takeaway from this saga anyone who argues that the jewish community tries to silence criticism of israel by calling it antisemitic is arguing in bad faith hard stop the entirety of the jewish political spectrum and the entirety of the national political spectrum and the entirety of the media spectrum vigorously criticized israeli policy yesterday we are yet to see or make an accusation of antisemitism related to any of these actual criticisms of i  sraeli policy from jewish insider  the condemnation of the israeli decision was swift and resounding on thursday though some minority voices spoke out in support house speaker nancy pelosi dca called it a sad reversal from the initial decision deeply disappointing and a sign of weakness house majority leader steny hoyer dmd who just returned from israel as head of a member democratic delegation said he urged netanyahu on wednesday not to make such an unwarranted and selfdestructive decision he also lamented that dermers original assurances to me were not true mainstream jewish organizations including aipac  were critical of the move the jewish federations of north america said every member of congress without exception should be allowed to visit israel the adl  antidefamation league called the move counterproductive the simon wiesenthal center said israels initial instinct to allow the visit was the right one and the union for reform judaism president rick jacobs said he feared the action will reverberate for years both in undermining israeli democracy and in making israel a wedge issue in american politics halie soifer executive director of the jewish democratic council of america  said israel was playing into trumps goal of politicizing support for israel mark mellman president of the democratic majority for israel  official page  said that while the two congresswomen declined an offer to engage to balance the itinerary for the trip the netanyahu government was wrong and unwise to deny their entry j street launched an online petition to call on israel to reverse its decision the zioness movement urged american jews who feel gutpunched to resist the temptation to turn your back on your community or the state of israel the the new york times editorial asked what are trump and netanyahu afraid of and the washington post editorial board called the decision a disgrace to both countries writing in the atlantic  former us ambassador to israe dan shapiro labeled the decision a massive selfown what a bulldozer to drive through the bipartisan consensus on israel the times of israel editorinchief david horovitz said israels move smacks of a loss of will by our leadership a loss of selfconfidence and the times bari weiss wrote that netanyahu had bowed before a tweet bloomberg  is eli lake writes that if the cost of trump is support for israel is an expectation for partisan obeisance then how much are those policies really worth,1

it was a horrific sight a live porpoise cried as its captors auctioned it off for parts literally the animal had tears rolling down its face and it was making crying sounds luckily two animal activists were able to purchase it and release it into the wild but the trauma is done and whoever did this is still out there sign on if you want chinese authorities to investigate this act of animal cruelty and punish the responsible parties poiposes are a lot like dolphins actu  ally and the porpoise in question is not only adorable but it is also endangered the finless porpoise is on the red list it is believed there are only about  of them left and this one was almost murdered for parts the sweet porpoise cried the whole time it was being auctioned off and it is likely that it was injured because when the activists took it out to sea it had a difficult time swimming it is completely outrageous that someone captured this rare and endangered creature just to torture and ultimately murder it catching and selling a finless porpoise is completely banned and illegal in china that is why we want to make sure the authorities find whoever did this and bring them to justice,1

last night several taylorsville residents braved the cold to visit with me at valley regional park one of them asked a pointed question which i have not really addressed if you are not in in favor of democrat leaders why are you running as a democrat the democratic party is dominated by their donors as much as their republican counterparts one could argue that the method to counter that truth is a third party but i believe it is to challenge the democratic party from wi  thin this election year is important on that score the democratic party will take the majority in the house of representatives despite the  institution of the gop redistricting plot without vocal and adamant opposition among incoming freshman ds the party will simply carry on pandering to the donors at the expense of pursuing farreaching reforms they will pretend once again that their majority is permanent and institute the same obstructionist rules that have governed the house for decades what is more this majority is bound to be a slim one and it is certain that the gop will once again unify their opposition that means one vote in a committee can alter proposed rules and legislation this congress in order to pursue aggressive reforms will need leftist independent of democratic members willing to challenge leadership in order to push reform that is the representative i hope to be kirkhamforcongresscom,1

"in shampoo bars that dont need a transition phase
i am so thrilled we have finally launched these new shampoo and conditioner bars from zerowastepath on our site
we absolutely love natural shampoo and conditioner bars and we have written an extensive blog post regarding my own personal experience when i switched to one and how it did require some time for my hair and scalp to get rid of all the chemical residues left by commercial shampoos and get used to the natural ingredients of these types of organic products
however i also know that some people are very short on time or have found it difficult to make shampoo bars work for them so we wanted to find a solution that would help absolutely everyone to get started on a zerowastehaircare
and here we have it these bars have shampoo and conditioner combined and they are made with gentle and biodegradable surfactants from coconut that will clean your hair without drying the scalp
what is so cool about them they dont require a transition phase they dont need an acid rinse after shampooing they lathers really well even in hard water no shampoo residue or build up they contain hydrolysed quinoa for extra softness and colour retention great for coloured hair available in  hair type variants normal hair itchy scalp oily and fine hair dry and curly hair
plus they are all  biodegradable vegan plasticfree and made with renewable energy
each bar will last for approx  washes choose the one that is best for your hair",1

news from today is council

fair remuneration for workers
approved by a majority the league voted against the law by which tuscany recognizes the right to all professionals to have ensured a minimum fair and adequate remuneration for the quantity and quality of the work performed in particular the professional services acquired by the region and by the bodies of the regional and local system are protected and regulated as well as those provided on the basis of requests presented to the public administration by private citizens and businesses
lost fund contribution for taxi drivers
a motion was unanimously approved to commit the council to allocate a grant for all holders of a taxi license in tuscany

to be clear this is a letter to the governor on statewide issues we all have separate roles from city to school district to county to state nothing in the letter is a reflection on the various things our city county and school district have done i have no doubt that city county and school district leaders are acting in the best interests of their entities as i try my hardest to do were in this together respect differing opinions love one another empathize with p  eople is stress on health finances amp liberties wash your hands amp wear a mask july   the honorable henry mcmaster state house office of the governor  gervais street columbia sc  dear governor mcmaster i first want to commend you and everyone in the governors office for the tireless efforts on behalf of the citizens of south carolina over the past four months i have no doubt that you are weighing all options to protect the health and safety including economic security of the citizens of our great state you made an unprecedented move closing schools on march   when our state had just  known positives you again made a courageous call with your home or work order on april   yesterday i agreed with you and legislative leaders recommending districts to delay the start date until september   it will be forever unknown how many lives you saved with these acts  it slowed transmission and allowed more preparation yesterday also made it clear we need a plan to get what we want we all want facetoface instruction sports and an uninterrupted economy however to get what we want we must do what we need we need to reduce transmissions before reopening schools in the meantime we need to plan for contingencies in case we fail with sevenday averages for cases and deaths rising hospitals sending stress signals and onequarter of the country asking our citizens to quarantine if we enter their state i am writing to encourage you to lead once again by a executing a statewide masking order so we can return safely to school and avoid any other economic restrictions and b ordering immediate action on the digital divide in our state so that when schools have to close those students will not be at a disadvantage with the rest of the state statewide masking we all want our students to return to facetoface instruction however this will not occur safely until we do what we need  slow the growth of the virus slowing the growth will take each of us sacrificing statewide masking is the least inconvenient solution there is nothing magical for the virus about labor day without masking it is an easy prediction that the rates will be worse in september than now time is of the essence if we want facetoface to start safely in september because masking will take weeks to show effects i understand the concern of enforceability but a you say it better than anyone that south carolinians are loving law abiding citizens b enforceability is not the point  we just need more use and c not issuing a statewide order has unfairly placed the question to  school districts  counties and hundreds of municipalities the result has been an immense amount of energy has been wasted and communities have been politically split on masking when the state knows it is the least inconvenient solution the alternative to slowing transmission by masking is allowing reopening in september without reduction which will ensure many schools will be shuttered soon thereafter and even worse results outside of wanting our schools to return facetoface safely is the larger picture of the health and wellbeing of all south carolinians imhe now projects masking would save  lives over the next three months i know you are a strong prolife supporter whether that number is half or doubled we can save lives with a stroke of a pen digital divide delaying the start date and masking is not enough governor if schools are reopened a realistic expectation is that many schools will need to close at some point to deal with an outbreak thus we need immediate action to address the digital divide issue you should not be in this predicament it is decades of failure i apologize for my part in that failure the digital divide puts a spotlight on our rural and racial divide in  children in counties with onetoone technology should not have a technological advantage over at least onethird of our state that does not even in counties with equipment advantage every county has internet access issues i understand this is not a quick fix but i am also looking into the future on march   the oneyear anniversary of the school closure order we likely will be dealing with covid our goal should be that no child will suffer lack of access after having a year to address but again that is what we want what we need is to do the work to ensure every child from abbeville to york has access governor i again want to commend you and your staff for the ceaseless work over the past four months on this public health crisis i do not envy your position and responsibility i am at your service sincerely representative neal a collins district,1

a sorceress in brazil a wink in india  walmart pleads guilty after a decade of bribes june    inside walmarts corporate offices in brazil one local contact was known as the sorceress for the ability to obtain government permits quickly in india concerns about bribery were met with a wink and a nod by walmarts local business partner in china money was funneled to a local landlord for government relationship consulting services and in mexico cars a  nd computers were donated to governments in communities where walmart was planning to build new stores for more than a decade walmart used middlemen to make dubious payments to governments around the globe in order to open new locations united states prosecutors and securities regulators said in a settlement agreement on thursday but even as employees frequently raised alarm the companys top leaders did little to prevent walmart from being involved in bribery and corruption schemes that lack of internal control led to a sevenyear inquiry that culminated on thursday with walmarts brazilian subsidiary pleading guilty to a federal crime the guilty plea and the  million in fines that walmart has agreed to pay capped one of the biggest investigations ever under the foreign corrupt practices act which makes it illegal for american corporations to bribe overseas officials walmart profited from rapid international expansion but in doing so chose not to take necessary steps to avoid corruption brian a benczkowski an assistant attorney general said in a statement the investigation which was conducted by the department of justice and the securities and exchange commission came after the new york times revealed in  that walmart had made suspicious payments to officials in mexico and then tried to conceal them from top executives at the companys headquarters in bentonville ark and even when the issues reached the main office an internal investigation essentially went nowhere the timess reporting set off years of legal trouble and executive reshuffling at walmart the company has spent roughly  million on lawyers and investigators trying to root out the problems as well as on hiring more people to bolster its compliance systems regulators said on thursday it was not only walmarts drive to grow quickly but its lowcost philosophy that led to poor internal controls the fine walmart will pay is less than the  million that federal prosecutors and regulators had sought when walmart was discussing a plea agreement during the waning days of the obama administration the times reported last november walmart was able to negotiate a lower fine after president trump who had previously criticized the foreign corrupt practices act took office walmart generated a profit of about  billion in its  fiscal year read more,1

hello my name is ami dar i am the founder of idealistorg  and i need to ask you a favor i am working on a longer piece about what we could all build together and if you have moment it would be so helpful if you could read this segment and let me know if it resonates with you andor if anything is not clear or bugs you in any way thanks in advance and apologies for sharing only this part here it is      we can do this and we can do it now we just need to st  art and to start the first thing we need is to see each other to see and to show that we are not alone that across the street and around the world there are many others who want and cherish the same things we do to do this there are two tools we can use a name and a symbol why a name because words count names matter if you are a teacher from peru and you meet another teacher from peru you only have to say two wordsteacher and peruto convey a lifetime of shared experiences and if you want to start a group for peruvian teachers you have the words to do it in our case the people are there but the words are missing you recognize these people our people whenever you meet them but what do you call them and if you cant name themif we cant name ourselveshow can we connect so lets take a name and make it our own a name that would mean freedom and dignity generosity and respect a oneword bridge that would allow us to connect across our religious national and political differences and see how much we have in common lets simply call ourselves idealists and lets own that name and the values it stands for as proudly and joyfully as we own every other part of our identity as soon as we do this and add that word to the string of nouns and adjectives that make up our infinitely diverse identities i am a wife mother scientist swimmer reader and idealist two things become possible we can connect here and now as easily as those peruvian teachers and we can look back at history and across all our borders and feel that in addition to our own national or spiritual traditions we are also the heirs of every person in every culture and era who fought and worked for more freedom and more dignity for more people thats no small thing but if names are useful symbols can be even more powerful think for a moment of the impact that the recycling logo and the rainbow flag have had around the world now imagine if freedom and dignity had a logo a joyful symbol that in a flash of color would allow us to say i am here and i share your deepest values and if you stand for freedom and dignity i will stand with you      that is it what do you think thank you,1

when i first hit upon the idea to write the fever of  what fascinated me even more than the story of inoculation a daring and profound medical innovation was the way a public health emergency stresses the social and political fabric of a community epidemics and pandemics do more than infect peoplethey infect whole societies the fever in the fever of  referred in part to smallpox and in part to the madness that comes over a people under threat of serious illnes  s and possible death what were seeing now in the united states as a whole are some of the same forces that convulsed boston but writ geographically largea government so fearful of the economic consequences of epidemic that it is trying to squelch a full and honest reporting of the problem thereby threatening to make a bad situation far worse a medical establishment threatened by an overwhelming case load it is not prepared to handle frightened people desperate to assign some reason for covid be it gods vengeance or a chinese germ warfare experiment gone awol and in ways that will doubtless become more apparent as time passes people trying to exploit the crisis for profit the good news is that covid isnt smallpox which historically has killed more people than any other infectious disease and this isnt  which means the question isnt whether an immunization can stop the outbreak but rather how long an effective vaccine will take to be developed and safely deployed as in boston this outbreak already has its heroes in particular dr li wenliang the chinese doctor who defied his government to warn of the outbreak and who died a victim of the disease in february and his colleague dr mei zhongming who died of the virus just a few days ago sadly it seems likely there will be many more victims and more martyrs before this is over will there be more heroes time will tell but my prediction is that when this outbreak is oversooner i hope than laterit will have changed america in some fundamental ways whether those changes are for better or for worse is up to us,1

"more than  people have died as a result of covid in stockholm
today is report shows that we passed  deaths as a result of covid in stockholm county it is a difficult number to take in even for me but one thing is for sure we must not be blinded by the number behind every number there are people affected relatives loved ones relatives and friends my thoughts are with you all
our common goal is and must be that fewer people will be infected need care and above all that fewer people will die the care staff make vital contributions the majority of the sick are discharged and we still have a large capacity to receive more but we do not want to end up there therefore it is still time to think we absolutely must not relax now
the early summer days are fantastic the weather is wonderful but this is no ordinary early summer we must prevent the spread of infection at all costs and this is only done if we all continue to keep in out and distance

"payroll politics and the upcoming election
the double pay for certain government employees is a community polarizing issue and the way is it being handled by the administration is like a bull in the china shop on roller skates the sudden influx of emergency pay bills are being viewed by many nongovernment employees as politicians following the time honored tradition of catering to the largest organized voting bloc government employees
when the governor shut down the economy nearly  employees from private companies were sent home with no compensation support even though many government agencies were closed as well deemed nonessential their employees were sent home at full administrative pay starting a polarizing fire
actions by government executives and politicians since then have only thrown more logs on the fire starting with the entire pacific stargate debacle which is the most egregious example of a bad example when the administration took very highly paid exempt managerial employees and put them into temporary positions declaring them essential front line workers making them eligible for the covid differential and potentially double pay the polarizing fire started
fanning the flames is the fact those high paid government executives doing low wage service sector jobs putting more than thirty low wage service sector people out of work leaving them without money food and hope
guam is attorney general poured gas on the polarizing fire with his assertion that the people on the front lines are not eligible for double play but those cutting payroll checks are eligible for double pay
all the politicians are working hard to prove their support for govguam frontline workers fixing the flaws pointed out by the ag while their nongovernment counterparts doing the same high risk jobs are left in the cold
the legislature needs to take a very hard look on the long range results of their actions as they propose legislation to clear up the confusion surround this issue
inconvenient fact one the main log feeding the polarizing fire is the fact that the number of government of guam people actually on the real front line is exceeded by the number of nongovernment people working at medical clinics hospitals grocery stores gas stations and restaurants who everyday find themselves in dancing close proximity to people who have or may have the covid virus where are the double pay bills for them
bill  further tarnishes the image of public service by declaring that all government executives and other managers eligible for the same double pay politicians all claim the real essential front line workers deserve
paying people on the real front line in this pandemic emergency like police fire emt is nurses and doctors extra compensation makes sense they are taking personal risks paying people like clerks accountants administrative assistants and other people not in dancing close proximity to people who have or may have the virus takes money away from being used for direct and genuine relief efforts meant for support of the tens of thousands of people financially devastated by emergency orders shutting down the island is economy
now i find myself confused as it appears that senator nelson is trying to have her cake and eat it two with two bills  and 
bill  appears to serve the needs and goals of adelup to make special people feel even more special by allowing them to receive double pay using cares act funding to pay for it so with bill  money meant to support a population hammered financially into desperate levels of poverty and food crisis by the governor is emergency orders to be diverted away from supporting people in dire straits to give even more money to government employees who never missed a paycheck
bill  will further divide the people into those who work for govguam and are special and those who do not so they are not
in the meantime the lines at food distribution points get longer more people are begging on streets and intersections and crime levels are increasing as desperate people start doing what they need to do to feed their children
bill  appears to address a lot of the essential employee identification problems that are polarizing the community by clarifying who essential employees are and setting a form of hazardous pay differential and while it is better for taxpayers than the double pay gravy train of the other bills some politicians are riding in advance of the elections it too fails to address the nongovernment essential employee compensation issues reinforcing the image of two classes of people government employees and the rest of us
inconvenient fact two as it was before the pandemic nearly  of guam is workforce were already living on poverty level wages not able to bank funds for an emergencies as they were barely surviving living from paycheck to paycheck
now those people have been without work without money and running out of food while government employees were sheltered from that storm in the meantime federal funds meant for assisting the people sat in government accounts for months while the administration pushed out cash advances to politically well connected businesses having cash flow issues
contrast how fast the administration and this legislature leap into the breach to partially fund the war claims payments in an effort to prevent michael san nicolas from getting any credit for the payments against how resistant the administration and this legislature to act with the same speed rolling out federal funds to the tens of thousands of unemployed service sector employees idled by the governor is emergency orders
for months federal funds sat in government accounts and food distribution efforts fell short of the need and unemployment assistance remains slow in rolling out people are getting desperate and politicians seem more concerned about taking care of the already taken care of government employees with little effort to take care of nongovernment employees with the same levels of urgency and action
inconvenient fact three now in addition to offering selected government employees double pay bill  now offers additional extra  hours of leave benefits and ability to cash out half the extra leave to be paid for by taxpayers most of who are out of work and accruing no leave benefits
for some of the infamous pacific stargate crew members those extra double pay hours plus leave benefit hours could result in an additional compensation of  or more all coming out of taxpayer pockets
the optics of this bill to nongovernment unemployed taxpayers appear that incumbent politicians are using the power of the public purse to pander for votes from government employees to protect themselves from challenges by political newcomers in front of what are expected to be hotly contested elections
in summary these bills collectively are branding the th legislature as the animal farm legislature as actions by senators continue along the lines of rule seven in george orwell is book all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others
when you debate these bills remember you were elected to represent all of us not just some of us",1

"a shot in the dark it stays with the double budget
our request for a return to the annual budget and thus a move away from double budgets was rejected by a majority of cdu and greens at the last meeting of the finance committee mayor thomas koppl had previously campaigned vehemently for the maintenance of the double budget in his opinion among other things administrative resources are saved
we see this approach extremely critical and a danger for quickborn is our quickborner administration already overwhelmed with the administration of three other communities the fourth community with ascheberg am ploner see will be added at the beginning of next year
there are considerable risks for the following financial years which require timely management and thus close monitoring on the part of politicians
the city of quickborn is not only exposed to significant tax default risks due to the covid pandemic irrespective of this significant risks relating to the development of trade tax income are already known
furthermore the municipal supervisory authority takes into account all double budget statements ff to assess the longterm performance of the city
the deficit of eur  million that has accumulated to date must be reduced in the near future
the financial policy spokeswoman for the schleswigholstein fdp and quickborn parliamentary group leader annabell kramer points out that budgetary law is considered the royal right of parliament and emphasizes in times of considerable uncertainty on the income and expenditure side an individual budget makes a significant contribution to ensuring that the politics can fulfill its responsibility to react to these uncertainties
in a twoyear period many circumstances change which almost always lead to several supplementary budgets in a double budget in the second year this is especially true in years with strong economic fluctuations even in stable budget years the planned figures in the double budget for a second budget year are inevitably less precise than for the first budget year
an approximately valid tax estimate in  for the year  currently seems impossible says parliamentary group leader thomas beckmann and warns a double budget would be an irresponsible shot in the dark
in this respect there are two reasons in particular to return to the annual adoption of the budget
 extreme planning uncertainty with current fluctuating framework conditions
 increased control requirements on the part of politicians due to the upcoming recession caused by the pandemic and significant income tax risks that are already known development of trade tax income

from concerned wind supporters living in north branch and burlington townships to those opposed to a wind project here comments have been made by a couple people at recent meetings that the people who support the project laugh at what you say at meetings no one is laughing at you the sighs or chuckles or groans made by some and not all come from the fact that what you and others say is very predictable you say you are not trying to stop wind you just want safe sighting but then the next statement is exactly what is expected which is the language from all the ordinances in communities where wind will not be developed because of the language you want the board to include its as if you think farmers are stupid you and others make fun of us and pick on those that have signed leases or agreements and then you come to meetings and act like you dont do that even if you dont make the comment directly you allow it on your site and you like or love comments made by others like norman or kevin and others that pick on people that live here or people that are doing a job he re that have never treated you poorly you claim the supporters of the project are greedy and selfish and we dont care about our neighbors when nothing is further from the truth you claim that the supporters are causing the divide when in fact we dont talk trash about you online even though we dont agree with you as a community we as a group of supporters treat you with respect both online and in person yet you dont do the same for us to our face maybe behind our backs we hear and see what you say verbally and in print the  members of your site dont all agree with your view points some are even signed up for the windmills some people actually support wind but will not sign because of the fear that you will start talking about them as well this is also a part of kevins strategy make it so people are afraid to say they support wind for fear of being bullied or ridiculed or their names being listed and shared online and people stating they ar e greedy also or worse most people dont want the drama so if a supporter of the project is rude to you at a meeting although its not right just as what you do and say is not right either it may be because of the comments they have read or heard that you have posted or said about them or one of their family members or friends it is a small town and word travels fast some people who claim out loud to not support the windmills coming here may feel differently they just dont want those opposed to know one last thing we would appreciate it if you would not state in your posts that you speak for all residents we can agree that we all want safe siting your definition of safe siting does not align with ours and what has actually kept people safe in the state of michigan for more than  years with over  turbines you dont speak for close to the  people who have signed leases or participation agreements and the more than  and still counting residents of burlington and north branch that have said they support wind in the community it would be like us saying we speak for all residents i dont think you would agree that we speak for you trying to keep it real trying to share a different perspective without shaming anyone it is possible,1

together with the departmental emergency operating committee coe we inform that the tenants of real estate that were used to develop commercial activities or services that today are suspended by covid will be able to resort to legal means of protection and protection managing to reach an agreement to deal with the costs of renting the premises
the proposal would generate economic relief for representatives of bars and restaurants gyms nurseries ballplayers event halls clubs cinemas theaters rooms for the meeting of religious activities and activities educational which must continue to respond to their rental contracts
we want tenants to be able to access the renewal of rental contracts or redetermination of the payment price mediation mechanisms based on the shared effort of both parties
details
given the circumstances of force majeure that we are going through and in the event of a lack of conciliatory will on the part of the owners the tenants have specific regulatory mechanisms for the situation in the pertinent regulations established in the civil and commercial code of the nation in articles   all this without prejudice to the provisions contained in the national decree no  that provides for the freezing of rents the extension of expired contracts the prohibition of economic penalties and the suspension of executions that they are complementary to protection standards for tenants established in national legislation

you have been unfaithfulin stark contrast to festive strains of o come all ye faithful god voices the exact opposite of what we want to hear this holiday season it is a powerful lesson of another nation who turned from dependence on god for deliverance and began to rely on their own independent spirit to accomplish the task and on the twentieth day of the ninth month all the people were sitting in the square before the house of god greatly distressed by the occasio  nyou have been unfaithful ezra  december  on our  gregorian calendar is the th day of gods th month so we know for sure this is certainly holy interruption appointed by the almighty for just such a season as this in the midst of our appointed holidays which is really just a contraction of holy and days we are called to repentance the first scripture of this bible lesson points to the fact that distress appears to be a prerequisite for repentance why were they distressed the prophet ezra spoke these words to the chosen people of god in verse  you have been unfaithful ezra said this in verses  the leaders came to me and said the people of israel including the priests and the levites have not kept themselves separate from the neighboring peoples with their detestable practices like those of the canaanites hittites perizzites jebusites ammonites moabites egyptians and amorites they have taken some of their daughters as wives for themselves and their sons and have mingled the holy race with the peoples around them and the leaders and officials have led the way in this unfaithfulness it wasnt just that the wives they had married had an idolatrous mindset all these manmade deities and the celebrations their mates brought with them became entrenched in the entire familys personal social and religious life worst of all their religious leaders cemented the idolatry deeply into the nation is mindset by participating themselves and not speaking out against it the people of israel including the priests and the levites have not kept themselves separate from the neighboring peoples with their detestable practices this lesson is not something that will be popular at all during our holidays but if god has given it as a bible lesson for this week we have  choices we can ignore it like the people of judah did for a long time they eventually fell as a nation or we can embrace gods word as the truth as we can see from this lesson sooner or later were going to recognize that doing things our own way even while calling on the name of the lord only leads to heartache and despair all the people were sitting in the square before the house of god greatly distressed by the occasion ezra expressed his anguish with the people of god in prayer in verses  at the evening sacrifice i arose from my fasting and having torn my garment and my robe i fell on my knees and spread out my hands to the lord my god and i said o my god i am too ashamed and humiliated to lift up my face to you my god for our iniquities have risen higher than our heads and our guilt has grown up to the heavens ezra had not taken part in the idolatry of intermarriage but we can see from his tense of writing that he has definitely taken on the role of intercessory warrior there are many of us christians in america today that feel the same way especially during this season of christmas god almighty appointed seven holy days or holidays over  years ago and placed them on specific dates on his calendar for mankind to celebrate every single one of them is about the appointed times of the ministry of jesus christmas isnt one of them being divided over the issue of celebrating christmas is nothing new the pilgrims english separatists that came to america in  were even more orthodox in their puritan beliefs than cromwell as a result christmas was not a holiday in early america from  to  the celebration of christmas was actually outlawed in boston by the early pilgrims anyone exhibiting the christmas spirit was fined five shillings by contrast in the jamestown settlement captain john smith reported that christmas was enjoyed by all and passed without incidentafter the american revolution english customs fell out of favor including christmas in fact congress was in session on december   the first christmas under americas new constitution christmas wasnt declared a federal holiday until june  the north and south were divided on the issue of christmas as well as on the question of slavery many northerners saw sin in the celebration of christmas to these people the celebration of thanksgiving was more appropriate but in the south christmas was an important part of the social seasonsince that time materialism media advertising and mass marketing has made christmas what it is today the traditions that we enjoy at christmas today were invented by blending together customs from many different countries into what is considered by many to be our national holiday httpwjmiblogspotcomthehistoryofchristmasinamer delve a little further into the christmas mindset and consider the history of santa claus he or it was introduced to most of america through the wellknown poem twas the night before christmas written in  at that time he was an elf with a miniature sleigh and miniature reindeer in  coca cola began putting up billboards of a human sized santa with a beard and ruddy complexion wearing the coke colors of red and white of course they sold lots of coke that year and have ever since as you can see we christians definitely need to question why were doing what were doing and not doing what we should be doing our christmas spending and celebration is a good place to start the national retail federation predicts during this winter holiday season of thanksgiving christmas and new years day americans will spend a mindboggling  billion dollars using christianity todays statistics that  of americans identify as christian thats  billion dollars we christians will spend this year during the christmas season folks we could divide that further among  million or so people in this country living in poverty and give each one  or we could divide it among the  million refugees in the world and give each one  so where does all this leave us perhaps we will begin to question why we spend unfathomable amounts on santas trees gifts and decorations and celebrations and church plays and productions all considered normal look up the word normal it means conforming to the standard could it be that another god has slowly been insinuating himself into our normal christian lives every single year and now we just cant live without him most of us christians rationalize that we are celebrating the birth of jesus and that is important and makes everything okay if it is so important to the good lord that we do so why didnt he appoint a holiday in his word for the birth of jesus he appointed the holiday of passover for the death of jesus unleavened bread for his burial and firstfruits for his resurrection and trumpets and tabernacles for jesus nd coming on the first day of the th month december  on our  calendar and continuing for  months the leaders of judah dug into the heart of the matter and how far reaching their sin actually was bottom line was the israelite men had gone outside of gods word and not only entered adulterous personal relationships but every area of their life had been tainted by it in the end there was only one solution and it was an extremely hard one to face and required drastic action they needed to confess their sin repent and depart from it and everything that it had bred including some of their own sons and daughters one of the israelite men put it like this we have been unfaithful to god by marrying foreign women from the peoples around us despite this there is still hope for israel now let us make a covenant before our god to send away all these women and their children in accordance with the counsel of my lord ezra  what god wants from his people will never change he desires a bride who is faithful to her bridegroom and whether weve committed adultery with the spirit of christmas or santa himself adultery is adultery but god has always been a god of mercy love and grace he has definitely shown that through his gift of his son jesus so while its true that we dont know for sure when christ was really born its also true that it could have been december  but before that fact can even be considered in the eyes of the almighty there must be genuine distress and repentance in the heart of the believer in jesus christ ezras closing words in chapter  should be our words today lord the god of israel you are righteous we are left this day as a remnant here we are before you in our guilt though because of it not one of us can stand in your presence you have been unfaithful,1

the increase in divorces has been a trend that has been going on for some time in the last  years they have practically doubled and it is not necessarily bad news especially in the country that has traditionally considered marriage as an immutable situation for many decades divorce was legalized in  by mao zedong although for many years it remained a women is right only on paper in particular separation was almost always granted when it was based on political reasons that is the woman asked to leave a counterrevolutionary husband who opposed the revolution of the communist party

a friend sent me a post that she had seen that claimed that white people have evolutionary reasons to fear other races because they have stronger genes that could lead to our extinction she asked me to respond i am posting my reaction first so that there can be no misunderstanding that the original post has any valid merits i am posting the original post beneath for reference my response below first thing an unnamed african american sociologist gave this lecture yeah right my first reaction is that this person has a seventh grade understanding of genetics black fur in mice is indeed dominant over white fur it is a simple mendelian trait and is controlled by one gene if a mouse has both a black and a white form of that gene they will be a black mouse however this is emphatically not how skin color or hair texture or any other trait you could attribute to race work in humans the list of human traits that are simple mendelian is shockingly short i know because this fact is super irritating when i try to introduce genetics to my students so i have perused the whole list to try to find the few examples they would give two hoots about most human traits including skin color are polygenic they are controlled by dozens or even hundreds of genes currently science knows about  genes that control skin color in humans for every one of those  genes that is functional your skin is a little bit darker for every one of those  genes that is mutated and nonfunctional your skin is a little bit lighter this is why humans are not binary black or white instead there is a vast spectrum of skin colors from alabaster to ebony despite the fact that skin color is a spectrum with absolutely no separate groupings whatsoever we can glance at a person for just a few seconds and easily classify them as black or white why is that the reason has nothing to do with biology and everything to do with our racist colonial history when we had slavery many if not most slave women were raped by their white masters the slaveowners needed the resulting mixed race children to be unquestionably considered slaves even when they were their own sons and daughters so they came up with two legal rules to ensure that mixedrace slaves didnt have a legal argument for freedom first by law a childs condition was that of the mother so even if your father were the president of the united states you were a slave if your mother was as indeed happened in the case of thomas jefferson and sally hemmings the second legal precedent that they came up with was the one drop rule in other words if you had any black ancestry you were considered black the end the one drop rule has colored and biased our thinking in ways that we cant easily perceive if a person who is black and a person who is white have a child together we only perceive that child to be black in truth for every trait that we perceive as racially specific the child will land somewhere in the middle we perceive someone in the middle as black because we have been taught to do so do you want proof in brazil race was perceived differently for historical reasons in brazil a mixed race person is considered to be white a brazilian person and an american person could look at the exact same human and see the exact same biological features and the brazilian person would see a white person while the american person would see a black person same thing for red and white and yellow and white i have a friend who is mixed lakota and european he has blue eyes and blonde hair the only way that a person could possibly think that mixed race folks would destroy white people is if they believe in race purity and superiority and trust me biology does not back them up as for global warming it cant have any effect on skin color because skin color is not an adaptation related to temperature and luckily for the racist who wrote this post the use of cfcs has been outlawed internationally and the ozone hole is closing they are luckier for this fact than they might know if the ozone hole had expanded we would not all be black we would all be dead the post to which i was responding this is a long post but worth reading it is a lecture i give to my history classes years ago i listened to an african american sociologist explain white fearhatred i almost turned the channel until she said at the end of the day we are mammalswith the same fight or flight responses to inherent and present dangers okayim listening white people should be afraid of people of color because we are the end of them i lean in prepared to turn off tv let me ask you thisif you have a cage of black mice and you pour them into a cage of white micewhat will the offspring be i lean back now fascinated more black mice because that is the dominate gene black and white mice and which is the weaker gene white mice so now you have a cage with less white mice so we let that cage which is of course represents the world we watch them breed browns and whites mean less whites blacks and whites means less white reds and whites means less whites yellow and whites means less whitesare you following me i am riveted her biology is undisputed no matter who you are you cannot disagree with this scientific fact so if you know people who hate people of color for no apparent reason there is a biological imperative for a species to fight against anything that threatens the speciesare you still with me i balk at species but keep listening now this is where it gets interesting as the world has opened up and we no longer live just in one place we are all mixing raceswhich is going to be necessary becausethere is that little hole called the ozone layer and a little thing called global warming i cock my head in question where is she going with this with unchecked uv rays hitting the planet what skin tone is least likely to be able to handle those uv rays my hand goes ti my mouth oh wow which skin tones can better handle what we are doing to this planet again we are talking about science herenot politics not religion not my own personal beliefs science facts we are evolving away from single races in order to survive because we all know darwin is theory of survival of the fittest and if we continue to have blended families to move about freely around the globe the eventual extinction of the causasoid race is inevitableat the very leastit will become like the white rhino and the white tiger a tiny minority on this planet i cannot refute the science of this so i look up reptilian brain because its only concerned with our survival and the reproductive success of our genes it will motivate us to always be as efficient with our evolutionary strategies  to move away from pain towards pleasure this means that the reptilian complex subconsciously determines our decisions making us find out the most costeffective solution to our behaviors even to our bad behaviors so she finishes we keep looking for the why of racism when we should be looking at the how to tame that part of our brain which sees people of color as a threatwhich we are by the very nature that our genes are stronger than any white genes we might procreate with that sentence alone will cause white people to sputter and rage wanting it not to be truebut wanting science not be be factual is a waste of energy quite simply we are evolving and we are doing so because if we do not we will most assuredly end up with the dinosaurs fascinatingdo not you think thanks for reading whatever your leaning this is just a very interesting way of

"can the government force everyone in this country to be vaccinated against the coronavirus when a vaccine becomes available let us examine this from a civics and citizenship perspective not through the lens of panic and fear
one side of the debate says authoritatively that yes the government can force you to be vaccinated they cite precedent but not so fast
we the people run the government indirectly through our elected representatives this is a constitutional republic not a democracy the us constitution limits and enumerates us government powers the government works for us according to the supreme law of the land
if you claim that there is court precedent saying the government can force you to be vaccinated that would mean that courts make law read article iii of the constitution courts do not make law article iii is a quick short read that spells out what courts do nowhere does it say that the court makes law that is the responsibility of the legislative branch check our article i you will notice that article i is about  times the size of article iii you will also notice how carefully the founders spell out the duties of the legislative branch they make the law not judges
if the legislative branch passes a law stating that everyone within the borders of the united states must receive the coronavirus vaccine would not that put the government in charge of your body what about foreign nationals in this country would they be subject to this law what about your right to life liberty and property which includes your body
what about due process of law should not any law not be unreasonable arbitrarily applied or oppressive
the argument for forced vaccinations includes the idea that you are being vaccinated to protect others it is not about you they say it is to protect others you can be forced to be vaccinated for the good of the community how do we determine if a vaccine is  safe for everybody or that this new vaccine will guarantee the death of coronavirus eradication
how do we determine if it is right and proper to drag citizens into the doctor and forced to receive a shot where have we heard of this before in history
forced vaccines may be expedient but are they wise are they constitutional as citizens we need to keep pace with the pros and cons of the vaccine and let our voices be heard
this is common sense civics and citizenship

who writes a simple commoner but not an obscure lackey that is why i do not shut up compatriots i am writing to you to remind you that we must practice love in the times of covid this implies total cleanliness as well as love and care for our loved ones family members etc as complying with the law it goes against our will but it is the only way to combat covid by respecting the quarantine we will achieve i do not infect you nor do you infect me this is how it is being practiced worldwide and it is giving great results let is observe nature what animal should isolate itself and take refuge until the bad weather passes well nothing less than the bear let is follow that example in the proportion that concerns us but between the two there is an abysmal difference because when winter ends and spring blooms the bear will wake up from its lethargy leave its sweet home cave and look for its food as well as the love of its life instead when we leave our homes at the end of social isolation and before a new dawn in our lives when traveling through our cities our country or perhaps abroad we will see that everything changed diametrically most countries will be in an economic social and political collapse never seen or experienced before gone for this reason it is known in advance that the imf wb idb and other associated banks have almost  billion dollars in their coffers not counting what china has everyone willing to lend them to those who need it of course there will be many including us well we will be facing a new world order of which we do not have why scare us but if we act with prudence since geopolitics and the world economy are like that as the sailors say after the storm comes calm what we must be careful and spin fine at the end of this pandemic making use of our resilience is that we must unite in order to build a good political party with a broad base that does not have a straw among its members goodbye corrupt not to the merchants of education not to the swindlers of social security not traffickers terrorists smugglers drug traffickers illegal miners merchants industrialists and corrupt builders former authorities and corrupt politicians etc for this reason following my editorial line with all humility i propose that the new broadbased political project be called peruvian people is progressive party and what will it do for citizens to integrate the famous political party mentioned above in first place it is a new political wave bringing innovation for  in the field of social sciences economics and technology in second place as a requirement its members and future applicants must be young people and people with a youthful spirit in tercer lugar the raison detre of the singular political party is to be pragmatic par excellence and not dogmatic by habit in fourth place as a yearold promoter you lie down but with a spirited youthful spirit i feel admiration as an arequipeno boy named jose a quisocala condori at  years old has created the ecological bank being his general manager recognized with the stockholm award and i am just trying to do something for my poor peru what does this reallife example teach us that we should not expect the state to give us everything to live when the situation is normal we must create and fight to obtain everything we need in fifth place the supreme goal of the state and society is the human person and his dignity and the protection of indemnity for him at work in sixth place since the party claims to be creators innovators and workers it proposes as a platform the creation and dissemination of disseminated shareholders by the state creating the investment and development bank but with a roof seventh all young people between the ages of  and until they graduate professionally andor technically can create junior companies with state guarantees and both state and private educational institutions with a market reserve for their purchasessales in eighth place after four years of learning and knowledge senior companies can be created who with capacity and solvency will be able to collaborate and compete in the national and international market in ninth place volunteering will be encouraged among young people for a period of two years so that they help their compatriots and get to know all of peru by providing their services in all state institutions without exception receiving a diet insurance and at the end a certificate that will have the value of  of the score to apply for any job andor studies be it state private or mixed in tenth place pensions must be collected and paid only by the state thus the contributions are guaranteed and updated over time in eleventh place the hospitals will be administered by a board of directors made up of a doctor a nurse an administrative officer three members of the local civil society and a representative of the ministry of health all elected for said purpose in twelfth place citizen security being of vital importance when innovating the constitution who causes the death of a person by fraudulent action will be applied the death penalty without exceptions in thirteenth place being that the justice emanates from the people a jury will issue its verdict goodbye corrupt judge in fourteenth place reelection is feasible for the only time as long as the person is worthy of it and the social and economic cycles allow it in fifteenth place the construction of the bullet train will be promoted from tumbes to tacna linking the coast from north to south and vice versa as well as giving greater fluidity to international traffic between ecuador and chile goodbye accidents goodbye assaults goodbye staying up late but without costing the state a penny from the national treasury finally our society runs between a dilemma the submissive who do not dare to break the chains of conformism suffering from apathy and indifference which is why they perceive in their lives an insurmountable frontier to achieve progress however the irreverent  through innovation we perceive a majestic horizon therefore i ask you to which sector of society do you think you should belong if you agree and

in particular we are talking about the complex of fountains pearl of love pedestrian fountains in cathedral square and fountains in central park
that is the city will not have to pay a penny for fountain maintenance services this year
an official letter from the water empire and my appeal will be sent tomorrow the company agrees to sign any document to speed up the launch of fountains in the city of uman
after a long quarantine people are very much looking forward to the start of the fountains
tourism in the city must develop this provides additional jobs development of hotel and restaurant trade business and most importantly increase revenues to the city budget
let me remind you that in  the amount of tourist tax revenues to the budget of the city of uman increased almost  times and this is uah  million compared to  uah  thousand
i really hope that the uman city hall will not hinder this process
i will continue to work on the development of uman

 i just felt like it was not an opportunity to just sit idly by and do nothing i think it is easy for us to just sit and kind of be like oh that is terrible that happened and that is it says tiffany powell a freelance portrait photographer who attended protests with her yearold son jackson i just wanted to lend a voice the pulse of what was going on there was just so much energy and passion that it kept drawing me back out
 i do think we are entering some pivotal moment of whether or not these protests as great as they have been are going to actually bring out some of the changes that i think we all want and i think that is still up in the air says kamau franklin but i think the amount of energy the dedication the anger that people have been feeling is something that has broken through

"orta is committed to the safety of all of our members with safety being our priority orta offers the following guidelines moving forward as ohio emerges from the covid  pandemic
 orta is first guiding principle is that all orta activities should adhere to ohio is governor is rules and guidelines regarding covid  the state of ohio is health department has provided a strong list of rules and guidelines for its citizensorta strongly supports these rules and guidelines
 as ohio emerges from the  istay home orders and people begin to resume their daily lives please remember that all orta members are in the category of high risk individuals since our membership is comprised of highrisk individuals orta activities should be curtailed until ohio is health department leaders indicate that it is safe to resume meetings
 currently activities that involve close contact less that  social distancing remain prohibited large groups more than  people also remain prohibited
 because orta local chapters typically meet in groups of people larger than  it is not suggested that local chapters resume meetings at this time
 a few local chapters have indicated that they plan to meet with their respective executive committees to conduct chapter business orta suggests that these meetings be conducted via conference call or some other remote mechanism orta will assist in this endeavor as it may be new many members call the orta office for assistance with this issue
 it is possible for a smaller group less than  people to meet in person if such a meeting is necessary please remember social distancing at least  remains necessary for any such meetings people that are especially at risk those with underlying conditions that place them at increased risk should not participate in any face to face meetings the use of a public park where meeting participants could bring their own chair is a possibility for maintaining social distancing face coverings and hand sanitizer would be required for such meetings
 we are in the beginning of the recovery phase our health leaders are working feverishly on a vaccine if we can hold on a little longer the end is in sight
 please feel free to lean on orta for assistance in keeping your local chapter active during the time of this pandemic",1

the reason why waves and waves of immigrants from all corners of the world have chosen canada is because we are free free to worship and free to speak and free to believe we are open open to the persecuted and the oppressed and the broken we are equal equal in opportunity and in value and before the law
it is because we are all these things that we are diverse diversity is a product of our strength and our strength is and ever has been our freedom
watch live as i lay out my vision for welcoming new canadians
justin trudeau says diversity is our strength but i think he misses the point
the reason wave after wave of immigrants from all over the world choose canada is that we are free free to pray say and believe what we want we are an open people we reach out to the persecuted the oppressed and the less fortunate we are all equal we believe in equal opportunities values and laws
these are all things that make up our real diversity our diversity comes from our strength and our strength is and always will be our freedom

the love for money greedy is the true pandemic by evangelista h��ctor p��rez fern��ndez may   cartagena de indias colombia the root of all evils is the greed which coveting some went astray from the faith and were pierced with many pains timothy  greedy is the true pandemic of humanity for all centuries and the church has not been oblivious to this evil with the false doctrine of the prosperity gospel for those who want to become rich fall into temptation and snare and into many foolish and harmful lusts which plunge men into destruction and perdition  timothy   the love of money distances us from the truth of god  world governments have always privileged the economy over life a wild and irrational economy generating inequality injustice destruction and imbalance there are four very telling recent examples in our village colombia and hispanoamerican  the government allocated   million to subsidize agriculture and guarantee supply in this crisis only  reached the farmers who represent  of our food security a structural agrarian reform is urgently needed to guarantee selfsufficient production  the lack of solidarity of the financial system in this crisis forces them to be placed on the waist canceling the privileges that allow them to enrich themselves in the crisis at the cost of impoverishment for all contemplate the legal way to nationalize some banks cancel abusive interest and service charges increase taxes create a more friendly and supportive financial system   the pauperization of the entire health system became more evident a consequence of the pandemic of love of money it is essential to dignify all health service provision  cancel any exploitation that threatens natural resources and the environment the dire consequences of fracking are clear an unequivocal sign was the bankruptcy of all companies that practice fracking in the united states it is imperative to promote clean energy let us not focus on the virus and its origin god is giving us the opportunity to reinvent ourselves as human beings no ideology solves it we must extirpate the love for money of world society including the church we must pray for all rulers to make wise decisions exchanging savage capitalism for fair equitable capitalism with sustainable development and social responsibility we should not be alarmed by what happens everything is written and it needs to happen let us focus on god is agenda not on the agenda of the enemies of the church and society the church will always be persecuted but as a church do not let yourselves be distracted from the purpose of god  peter   but there were also false prophets among the people just as there will be false teachers among you  matthew   for nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and in different places there will be famine and earthquakes and you will hear of wars and rumors of war watch out do not be alarmed because all this needs to happen but it is not yet the end  matthew   jesus answered and said to them see that no one deceives you but god calls us to repentance  chronicles   if my people upon whom my name is called humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then i will hear from heaven and will forgive your sins and heal your land  i recall sir is anecdote winston churchill in world war ii when he felt defeated in the face of the impending nazi bombing and invasion and told the nation that all they had left was to pray and prayer chains were put together throughout the country hitler was on the way but never came an intense fog wrapped around the nazis and they returned the queen said i am more afraid of an army of people praying than of a military army the quarantine and gradual opening of the economy are necessary to give time to prepare the entire health system and also to avoid an immediate massive contagion which the health system is not capable of attending to and this collapse many dying ideally those infected are progressive and circulate in the health system and they are all cared for and recovered thus the herd or collective immunity is being given while the studies of the vaccine in different countries are advancing at full speed global immunity from the world is very likely to come before the vaccine when  of humanity is already infected it is cause for concern that despite this world crisis the economy still continues to be privileged over god and life seeking to open all areas of the economy and leaving the churches last because in these people we find emotional restoration and true peace this shows who is first in the heart of the vast majority of the rulers of the world matthew  but seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things will be added to you we must fight against the love of money greed developing deep economic social political transformations and we as human beings or worse consequences will come  kings  you will hear their prayer and their supplication in heaven and you will do them justice what is happening is fulfillment of the word in isaiah   god is in control with the confinement the gospel has grown the fervor is growing in the search and communion with god colombia and hispanic america will be victorious a revival will begin our nations so despised rejected humiliated tainted plundered exploited where evil abounds god will raise them up to shame the powerful and wise  corinthians    romans   but where sin abounded grace abounded all the more romans   and we know that for those who love god all things work

todays special session of the north carolina general assembly today a bill was filed and introduced known as house bill  titled ballot designationsreferenda the sole purpose of the bill was to eliminate the power of a commission currently composed of secretary of state elaine marshall a democrat attorney general josh stein a democrat and paul coble a republican whos in charge of legislative services at the general assembly from writing a brief caption or syno  psis of each of the six constitutional amendments that will appear on the ballot in novembers general election this means that the public will not have any context or understanding of these amendments as it currently stands the language that will appear relating to each constitutional amendment is vague obscure and in many instances disguises the true purpose and intent of each of the constitutional amendments therefore voters could be persuaded and misled into voting for an amendment because they are worded in a way that might lead someone to believe that they were a good idea this type of intentional voter deception is problematic and unfortunate the true purpose of these amendments is for the republican majority to do messaging around them that will increase the turnout of their base voters in november the republican majority is afraid that without these constitutional amendments on the ballot to drive out their base democrats have an excellent opportunity to break the republican supermajority and to potentially take the majority in this years general election i hope that voters will be smart enough not to be persuaded by these type of tactics two of these amendments are specifically targeted at undercutting the authority of governor cooper and future governors to appoint persons serving on over  boards and commissions as well as appointing judges in our state in a manner in which it has been conducted for decades this is why former governors both republicans and democrats are opposed to the idea of amendments curtailing the power of our governor which is already weaker than many states,1

this is my testimony for the first  years of my life i was just your average kid but all of that would change forever on a cold rainy day in february  in ephrata washington i was  years old and i found myself in a park with my best friend evan we did not go to that park that day to murder craig sorger it was just another day in my average life until evan pulled a knife out of his pocket and told me he wanted to go on a killing spree at first i thought he w  as just making a sick joke surely he wasnt serious but i soon found myself following him to a nearby travel trailer where  year old craig sorger lived evan knocked on the door and asked craigs mom if he could play we roamed the park playing near a canal before stopping to build a fort in a wooded area in the back of the park this was when my average life changed forever evan asked craig to touch the ground for  seconds craig got on the ground and began counting at  evan dropped a rock on the back of craigs neck knocking him to the ground i got up and tried to stop evan i said stop evan got off craig and pushed me to the ground i stayed there and watched evan began hitting craig  more than  times several times craig tried to get away but evan repeatedly pulled him back to the ground and continued to strike him i did not see anything in evans hand but he was stabbing craig to death i look back and i wish that i would have done something to rescue craig its one reason i now do everything in my power to rescue the preborn from the slaughter the attack lasted minutes after which craig remained motionless on the ground i then picked up a stick and was going to hit evan but he had a terrifying look in his eyes i was afraid that i was the next in his killing spree so i braced the stick walked past evan and struck craig in the head and legs before throwing the stick to the ground evan said nothing he walked to me and he shook my hand  days later we were arrested for st degree murder and held on  million dollar bail we spent months proclaiming our innocence first saying that we had seen craig walking towards home from the park we later said craig had fallen from a tree we were tried as adults becoming the youngest defendants tried as adults in washington state history a year would pass before i broke down and finally told the truth about what happened i would plead guilty of nd degree murder by complicity and sentenced to  years after my sentencing a journalist asked me if i was angry i received a  years sentence i said no i deserved worse the next day i was transferred to prison my time in prison started badly i spent the majority of my time in solitary confinement for fighting i was locked into a  by  foot cell for  hours per day where the lights were on all the time there were no windows in my cell to let in light my only view was the window in the cell door that looked out onto a sterile cellblock when i was allowed out for one hour of recreation per day i would first be stripsearched then i would be shackled hand and feet and taken by two guards to a small brick cage that was my exercise yard i was not allowed to talk to the guards or to the other prisoners i would then be shackled again and led back to my cell all meals were served to me through a slot in my cell door i lived like this year after year after year the only positive that came from all those years in solitary confinement was that i taught myself how to read and write i spent all of my time reading book after book i must have read thousands of books those years in solitary confinement must have also taught me a lesson because i stayed out of trouble for the rest of my sentence for the  years i spent in prison there was only one thing i looked forward to visits from my best friend marissa we had been friends since we were  years old our fathers worked together and she had served as my character witness at my trial she attended my sentencing hearing we exchanged hundreds of letters over last decade i spent in prison and  years before i was released we fell in love in  three months before my sentence was up i escaped i fled my work release program in yakima wa and hitchhiked  miles to idaho from there i jumped on a bus to south dakota where us marshals captured my at gun point at a rapid city bus stop looking back now i was simply overwhelmed by the responsibilities of work release after living my entire life behind bars i served out the rest of my sentence in state prison before being transferred to county jail to be charged with st degree escape i faced  more years in prison i found myself on the top floor of one of the worst county jails in the country the first day i witnessed a man murdered by  other prisoners it was in this environment that god began to work on me in my jail cell i found  books the bible the journals of jim elliot and eric metaxas biography on detrich bonhoeffer this last book sparked my interest in reading the bible i was impressed by bonhoeffers bold stand against the nazi holocaust in my cell i began to read the bible every hour that i was awake i was reading it i would spend five six hours reading then fall asleep wake up and begin reading from where i left off on january th  i remember falling on my knees and calling out to god to save me i know that we are saved by repentance and faith but at the point of conversion all i knew was that god loved me and i was saved i remember getting up from the floor of my jail cell and it was like the old jake eakin stayed there dead and a new jake eakin rose from the dead and i knew that nothing would ever be the same again the grace of god found me on the floor of a jail cell he met me there and and changed me forever i was born again i realize that i was not worthy of the grace that i had been given i was a murderer and i deserved nothing but death and hell but by the grace of god i was alive and i wanted to spend the rest of my life obeying the call of my king with every breath of grace i had in my lungs i hope my testimony sheds light on the truth of the gospel and its power to save the worst sinners no sin is too deep that gods amazing grace cannot reach we serve a mighty god who can take murderers and transform them into instruments to advance his kingdom paul was a zealous murderer out for christian blood before god used him to save thousands we serve a god who can save repentant murderers when i was released in february  i briefly moved in with my family within months i married marissa but i remember feeling adrift not sure what god wanted me to do with my life a few weeks before my wedding while sitting on a coach with marissa i saw a youtube video that stopped me in my tracks it was of rusty thomas the national director of operation save america staging a rescue outside an abortion clinic in louisville kentucky at one point in the video rusty thomas was sitting on the sidewalk in handcuffs and he turned to his son jeremiah thomas and told him son this is your heritage something about the look on jeremiahs face broke my heart for the preborn children being murdered through abortion i had never even thought about abortion before that moment but i felt the lord move on me and break my heart for the preborn it changed my life forever all glory to god for what he has done in my life i have nothing good in myself i am a redeemed murderer deserving of death and hellfire but god chose to radically change me if god can save me then no one is beyond his power to save,1

i have been writing lately under three different titles sometimes the subject matters overlap what starts out as psychology runs into economics what starts out as politics turns into economics and what starts out in paranormal and parapsychology turns into both
psychology can sometimes be better understood with a mix of parapsychology and economics has everything to do with our psychology in our consumer and free lacking boundaries society add to that my background a degree in management a degree in psychology  years in the military service leadership training you can see how things get mixed up or get connected in my head ine thing connected to another to another to another so if sometimes what you think of a a jumble actually makes a lot of sense if you ponder deep enough one thing you can know that what i am saying is probably not in everyone is mind because they dont have the same background
every year the republicans and the democrats talk about cutting spending reining in the deficits there are lamentations and protestations hand ringing and proclamations and in the end the deficits keep growing
the democrats offer higher taxes that are shor down by the republicans and the republicans try to cut social spending only to be opposed by the democrats meanwhile the rich keep getting richer and the working class losing all but we all have a great time

it took me a while to get back here eleven days to be exact but if you read my blog i havent really been gone my schedule gets busy and time gets away
back in  i wrote about how we have been conditioned to expect and accept failures of others and our own also everything is normal this how things are move on
if it were a fact then why we have so many problems anxiety personality disorders addiction ruined families child abuse and neglect and much much more we really dont know how to handle life if it had become normal if we knew how to accept things we would not be having these issues but here we are we have failed the experiment we are not ready for a national disaster we are not personally responsible we cannot survive any disruption of our day to day routines and we cannot give up our habits good or bad we are not fiscally responsible as people or as a nation we are always ready to blame someone else is that not what i have been saying for the last year for the last so many years we cannot find our way without help without guidance because we have refused to learn anything
no we can not all live off the land no we cannot do our own thing brandishing weapons to buy a hamburger or to get a haircut and threaten eachother what is the difference between someone who beats up mcdonald is cashier and some that marches loaded with weapons down the street while he either cant get laid or his ole lady is screwing his buddies we cannot live without a pay check but envy those who get a hand out to survive because they have lost their job
we are not even a one nation we are not even good neighbors or good citizens that are concerned about the welfare of everyone in the country we a  million whinners but i said that before the covid disaster many of us have some strange ideas about what is freedom we think we have been brainwashed into believing that we are all privileged that whatever we want we should have we must have and it must be provided from the rich scumbags to the politicians to the police to anyone with a job and anyone without a job and welfare every single one wants something just for being the rich believe they should have all the money and the poor can go eat dirt but the poor dont even recognize and believe that money grows on trees we all claim we are the richest country in the world and then realize that we are trillions in debt so we talk about cutting socialsecurity eliminating medicaid cutting pensions healthcare benefits and veterans benefits but never about cutting the profits and outrageous pay they our owners have we have been so programmed that we fail to recognize our own miserable conditions
give the page a like you may not like me you may not even like what i say but you will leran something something you dont want to or like to hear the truth about what we have truly become and what is bound to happen if we do not wake up

"we want a smart restart
open letter
the coronavirus set us off track our everyday life kindergartens schools planned trips carefree daily meetings shopping and queues at the checkout the coronavirus has robbed many of us of our jobs orders clients contracts performances he cut off our children from schools and relationships with their peers blaming us for their learning many families lost their only source of income for a long time the coronavirus has upset the current order carrying the specter of a crisis on an unprecedented and unpredictable scale the pandemic in which we involuntarily found ourselves forced us to change our goals strategies and planned career paths it is impossible not to notice it it is impossible not to wonder what will happen next
how to find and organize in this new unknown world in the new poland
in fact in which the mask and the disinfectant liquid are symbols of social responsibility but also an expression of our fear for survival survival for which our individual actions are no longer enough today we know for sure that in order to deal with the effects of a pandemic permanent changes and a wise restart of public policy are needed action is needed that will allow us not only to keep jobs but also reduce climate change
the climate crisis has not been completed
the coronavirus is just a dress code for what climate change can bring
all it took was a tiny pathogen to stop the world economy in a short time it does not take a vivid imagination to predict what will happen to us when irreversible climate change accelerates today we observe with concern their foretaste all over poland which is affected by drought
there is no escaping the catastrophic effects of climate change and there is no place to hide from the virus today this is the last moment to act effectively in the fight for survival we must emerge wisely from the collapse that has hit us building a new collaborative economy one of the priorities of which will be genuine concern for the climate
let is restart the economy wise

let is restart the polish economy wisely both for us and for future generations
let is build jobs companies cities and the economy that are friendly to both people and the climate when creating support programs we should not lose sight of the environment we choose solutions and technologies that are innovative and will serve us for many years
for municipal and national investment plans let us choose initiatives that limit climate change improve air quality and support health care municipal services and education protecting us from drought and torrential downpours
let us act within european structures and values the direction of climate neutrality developed and chosen by the european union has not changed despite the crisis the european green deal is an opportunity to transform polish cities villages and companies we cannot afford to remain on the sidelines
when planning a restart of the economy and investments both nationwide and locally

support investments that increase efficiency
energy and develop renewable energy

the coronavirus set us off track and stopped us let us use this warning well treating it as a lesson and an impulse for a wise restart of the economy as well as our thinking
who we are
the appeal for a wise restart of the economy was initiated by people and organizations who were united by care for society and the natural environment the immediate impetus for writing the letter was the outbreak of the covid pandemic in march ",1

"the virus of sovereignty of interpretation
the mass media is bitter struggle against the facts
the mass media are firing on all cylinders hardly any other topic before has been able to unmask the ideologically colored and extremely framed reporting in such an obvious way this is not surprising since the establishment is concerned with nothing less than averting a complete loss of trust in published opinion this is becoming increasingly difficult in view of the clear facts regarding the corona fake similar to an animal driven into a corner the representatives of the old parties and their willing helpers in print and television act with an unprecedented level of aggressiveness against everything and everyone who dares to question the obvious inconsistencies in view of the threatening fight for the sovereignty of interpretation the established media landscape obviously feels compelled to publish discrediting and abusive articles against all those who are critical of the government is corona measures at an unprecedented frequency the aggressive tonality in such hate speech which has appeared almost inflationary in the past few days is no coincidence under no circumstances should those who have previously held the comfortable position of being able to establish the published opinion as public opinion engage in an objective debate in view of the clear facts regarding the corona fraud this would be associated with a loss of trust on an unprecedented scale instead the decision was made to celebrate the credo of divide et impera ie rule by division in the familiar manner
from ard and zdf to the major daily newspapers and spiegel there is no balanced reporting whatsoever in the reporting on the recent increase in demonstrations against the government is corona measures of course the responsible editorsinchief are aware that accepting the arguments of the critics would be tantamount to capitulating the previously propagated lack of alternatives to the measures for the politicomedia cartel the only tried and tested remedy against the protests of the most diverse population groups which are loudly visible at those rallies seems to be a merciless discrediting of the participants the now absolutely inflationary use of the old battle terms and manslaughter arguments such as conspiracy theorists and aluminium hat wearers illustrate the beacon into which the corona fraud has forced the established media system
on the basis of this narrative of course established politics does not shy away from regurgitating such brute propagandistic approaches for example federal president steinmeier recently announced in this context that wearing a face mask is more advisable than wearing an aluminum hat  this unfunny disparagement of critics of government measures by a head of state is of course not an attempt at unsuccessful irony but the logical consequence of an interpretational sovereignty that cannot be regained on the basis of facts the exceptional situation brought about by the old ruling clique itself makes it absolutely necessary in view of the increasing protests from the broadest sections of society to split this resistance after all who likes to get involved with something that is supposedly only supported by crazy people extremists and other weirdos
the systematic denigration of the critics is therefore not a bizarre side effect but quite the opposite the actual core of the corona issue for the established structures it is a matter of averting a loss of trust on an unprecedented scale grotesquely this only works because of the clear facts by means of argumentum ad hominem ie with pseudoarguments that aim to attack the personal circumstances or characteristics of the critics in order to be able to avoid a substantive debate or to put it another way those who have taken the trouble to understand the facts of the corona fraud are already lost to the mainstream anyway so it is about convincing those who still believe in the story of a virus that is endangering the world is population that people with different views are crazy cranks and it is not worth dealing with their arguments interestingly until february  the government and the media were still playing down the coronavirus and calling warner nuts and scaremongers this approach is not new in the struggle for sovereignty of interpretation george orwell already outlined in his dystopian novel  a continuous change in assessments of the situation by those in power this was intended to give the population the impression that the state had always been an advocate of this view the stigmatization of views that are contrary to published opinion works in this way even with a  degree turn on the other hand people employed in relevant positions in the state apparatus who point out the abuses and express dissenting opinions are dismissed without further ado a consultant at the bmi who came to the conclusion in an page analysis that it was a global false alarm that went undetected for a long time was removed from his job and banned from the building 
a karl lauterbach who has groundbreaking tips such as converting vacuum cleaner bags into respiratory protection masks has been granted  appearances on major german talk shows since the beginning of march   on the other hand serious critics are still studiously refrained from being invited fortunately this is playing a less and less role because those who still think they are informed from multiple perspectives through political talk shows seem unwilling or unable to leave their ideological cocoon anyway the others on the other hand will succeed in penetrating propagandistic representations in other areas as well and thus increasingly evade the interpretive sovereignty of the established system if you want to gain something positive from the systematic attempt to curtail our freedom rights and destroy our economy you can be sure that those people who are now being discredited by the hundreds of thousands by the systemic press will take a closer look at the abuse of other groups in the future because once you have recognized that the emperor is sitting naked on his throne you can no longer be convinced that he actually died of corona

"councilman roquel requests the authorities to strictly control isolate and assist santacrucenos who return from the north and from punta arenas
the request is forceful energetic uniting and evidencing the vigilance and concern of thousands of residents of our capital city who are deeply concerned about this dynamic scenario that the pandemic necessarily imposes as is the necessary fair and unavoidable return of those who are stranded due to different circumstances in the north of the country andor in chile which is why professor leonardo roquel formally raises it through a draft resolution that demands and implores the accompaniment of the entire deliberative council of rio gallegos
specifically the initiative of the mayor president of the ucr unidos block proposes to request the municipal mayor that through the decisions and resources that are within his reach or arbitrating why not all the necessary measures before the provincial government to have its support and collaboration as the highest authority of the city urgently manage the accommodation for a period of  fourteen days of all the people who will be repatriated to the city of rio gallegos soon also guaranteeing the safety and hygiene measures of each one of them in the places where they will remain isolated as well as food and other usual conditions of daily life
in this sense professor roquel stated that it is in the public domain that on may  the last registered covid patient was discharged and admitted to the regional hospital a fact that generated peace of mind regarding the control of the situation of the pandemic in rio gallegos but also that it is imminent in these days the arrival in our city of more santa cruz residents who for different reasons are still outside the province in the north of the country and mainly in the town of punta arenas chile where we know the unfortunate figures of infections and deaths that are being generated is that we strongly request and demand that this control isolation monitoring and assistance operation be applied and developed for our fellow citizens who will return home for the quarantine period recommended by medical professionals and that allows us to detect whether or not they present the symptoms of the disease illness
the measure of repatriating these people continued the councilman allowing them to return to their usual place of residence is correct logical and with which the population i have no doubts the majority fully agrees but in the face of this scenario that we have to go through the authorities must take responsibility and make immediate decisions mainly for the tranquility integrity and protection of the health of the entire community in general that is why i request he underlined that the necessary means be arbitrated to be able to accommodate these people in hotels in the city guaranteeing as i said the safety and hygiene measures and the medical supervision of each one of them and fundamentally food an issue that will bring a collateral benefit since in this way the state will also be able to generate a flow of activity to sectors of the economy that today are totally or partially paralyzed such is the case of restaurants to cite just one example",1

giving thanks in the time of impeachmentrecipes thanksgiving is a day for remembering a day for healing but also a day for celebrating thanksgiving isnt just a day for cooks because it involves moving food into and out of the oven thanksgiving is a day for cooks because it both radiates and needs all the kindness and compassion that are at the heart of cooking two years from now will be the th anniversary of that first truly american thanksgiving that european sett  lers ever experienced but it was by no means the first american thanksgiving we all need to be very careful when generalizing anything about our native american community its a very real possibility that there is more diversity within the native american community than in all the other cultures here in this country combined still a theme that runs through so much of what was here before europeans ever arrived was this notion of giving thanks and not just for one day a year but constantly that we get to participate in the continuation of this tradition is honestly pretty awesome but this awesomeness needs to be tempered with the reality of the horrors the arrival of the europeans set in motion with so little attention and even less honesty given to the atrocities that were committed against americas native community theres no way this one day where we actually pay attention to their story cant also demand protest and sadness for ordinary people this combination of polar opposite emotions while also trying to place far more good food on the table than any other day of the year can be overwhelming but for cooks this is where we shine some day my hope is that thanksgiving will be a day all americans come together in the knowledge that what actually makes america great is not to be found in what the europeans brought with them but instead in what was flourishing here already when they arrived its time we all understand that america was not born on july   that was simply us declaring our independence from britain instead the idea of america was born at least in the minds of europeans over the summer of  in the kindness of tisquantum and the wampanoag people theirs was a humanity for the ages but before we get on to the better thanksgivings of the future we must first take on the racism towards native americans that has never ended for me i think the place to start is with stopping the association of native american imagery with sports theres no way around the horrors that started with a plague ultimately turned into a holocaust holocausts cant be committed behind closed doors they have to be committed in the open and because of this with every holocaust there needs to be a lie crafted and then continually repeated to claim justification for the atrocity for the holocaust against our native community the lie was that they were too wild too savage too uncivilized to live at peace with others this lie has never been honestly addressed and still continues on to this day with sports naming that places native americans alongside the lions and tigers and bears that are meant to invoke the image of fear and uncontrolled violence this lie has to end it hurts children all children no matter what their background please do what you can to speak out on this to those that will listen and even more importantly to those that wont as a cook you not only have the skills to promote humanity you have the strength to speak out against inhumanity your strength is something everyone you know is thankful for whether they have the strength to admit that or not you matter to those around you you are admired by those around you  years ago a meal happened that was so good and so right that we have relived it every year since lets all do what we can to make a day worthy of that spirit love people cook them tasty food its not that difficult thanks for having the spirit of a cook bill billpenzeyscom and as promised here are some recipes satisfying seasoned nuts,1

every one of the democratic candidates remaining would make a better president than donald trump but the race for the democratic nomination is a fractured one it is not a straightforward narrative captured by glancing at a map and the process will not be decided by the simple horse race numbers in clickbait headlines that is never been our focus  our focus is on building a broad coalition to win delegates everywhere for months elizabeth has been near or at the top of the li  st of candidates that voters are considering for president according to the latest economistyougov poll  of voters across all age groups are considering voting for warren including  of selfdescribed liberals and  of selfdescribed moderates elizabeth is best positioned to unite the party and lead the democratic ticket to defeat donald trump our campaign is no stranger to being written off or counted out early but here is what we do know elizabeth has proven the doubters wrong before elizabeth is progressive effective and has lived a life that has prepared her for this fight with a strong organization of more than  staff on the ground in  states bolstered by a movement of more than  grassroots donors we are confident that as americans continue to get to know elizabeth they will see what we see every day elizabeth is the only candidate who can unite the party and defeat donald trump in november but the only way we will win this nomination is if everyone reading this digs deep and funds our  grassrootsfunded campaign can you help us keep moving forward chip in   or whatever you can to power this movement through the critical races to come,1

"pandemic action risks
as we plod on through the third month of the covid pandemic it seems prudent to assess the risks inherent with various courses of action aside from what our benevolent government is telling us to do what should our reaction be that is to say if we are thinking independently about our own wellbeing including the wellbeing of others around us what should we do about the mess in which we find ourselves should we stay at home all day should we wear a mask should we wear rubber gloves should we wash our hands every hour should we wait for instructions from the government or god forbid from the news media should we do nothing and just hope for the best if we are even thinking about doing something to help ourselves we ought to assess as best we can the risks and potential benefits of our actions preferably before we leap to the fore
in any effort to assess risks and rewards we must realize that we do not know everything i recognize that the aforementioned thought may come as a surprise to some especially to our politicians but it is a reality we do know some things and we think we know some other things and we can speculate that we might know even more things but the reality is that we do not know everything so let us go with reality if we are going to assess risks and rewards let us also agree that there is just a smidgen of possibility that we might be wrong and that we might indeed be recommending actions that could hurt us in other words assessing risks may be risky chew on that a minute if you will having said all that let us try to assess things based on our current state of knowledge belief and supposition
what are the chances that we will die from covid let us start there well there are about  million people in the united states the statistics published through may   say that  of our countrymen have been diagnosed with the virus we have to recognize that there may be more people who are infected with the virus than have been tested and found infected so let us err on the cautious side and guess that is what we are doing you know guessing that the number infected is  not just  going with our cautious guess that means that the statistical odds of becoming infected with covid are  in  million or about  that does not seem too scary does it to put this number in perspective the chances that you would be struck by lightning are  in  or about  and the odds of being in an automobile accident are  in  or about  to go further with this line of thinking published statistics as of may   also show that the number of people in the united states who have died from the covid virus is about  that means that the chances of dying from the virus is about  in  of those who become infected with it or about  and that the likelihood of becoming infected and dying from covid are about  in  million or  to put this number in perspective the number of us citizens who died last year from heart disease was  the number who died from cancer was  and the number who died from accidents of all types was  i was forced to take academic courses in statistics both at georgia tech as part of my undergrad education and at the university of south florida during my mba program and i despised them but i am now persuaded that those detestable courses may have left some remnant of understanding in my brain which tells me that a  chance of dying from covid in the united states is not repeat not a big risk this is the science that everyone keeps talking about
so if the odds of dying from covid are so small as to be an acceptable risk why are so many of us so fearful that we are afraid to leave our homes again i can only guess because there are not any statistics i know about which describe the reasons our citizens do things i will have to rely on personal observation anecdotal information and by gosh and by golly thinking also known as kentucky windage to posit an answer to this question of fear and inaction warning here these thoughts are not scientifically grounded they are the product of what i hope to be independent reasoning a generally foreign concept to many of our citizens here are some possible reasons for the fears
 the everpresent media continues to drum up the idea that we are all doomed
if we do not stay indoors with masks and gloves on it is as if they want us all to be
afraid
 nobody seems to be able to say exactly when the virus will be eradicated if at all
i note that nobody seems to be able to predict when heart disease or cancer will
be eradicated either but somehow folks seem to be paralyzed until
the all clear signal of complete eradication has been sounded for covid i
think this has to do with the newness of covid heart disease and cancer have
been around and talked about for a long time and we have become used to them
even if we still see them as a threat
 the unknown is the greatest of all fears
 it is easier to hunker down in front of the tv or the computer than it is to try a
different and maybe risky approach
 this is an election year there is a possibility that some folks are using the fear of
covid infection to influence voters to elect their candidates
 it has been said that the average intellectual capability of our citizens hovers around the sixthgrade level in my observation few sixthgraders see the big picture of life
 some of the actions of our government have made it more financially beneficial to
accept government handouts than working can provide
 schools have suspended inperson classes and parents have to stay home to
look after their children
 it is easier for those who have a means of financial support without going to work
to agree with the stayhome policies than it is for those who struggle to buy food
because they cannot work
 there are many in my observation who find it hard to trust anything or anyone
other than their own feelings to them there are no absolutes no truths no
standards and consequently for them there is no lasting peace about anything
what then if anything should we do should we stay the course and accept its consequences or should we undertake some level of risk in order to change our circumstances if you agree with the analysis above you will want to make some changes if then we want changes what changes
to be sure this is what i am not saying
ignore the orders from your government
throw caution to the wind and do exactly as you please
it does not matter what we do
look out for number one and let the fates of others fall where they may
science is wrong
there is no truth so we will have to fend entirely for ourselves
but here is what i am saying or at least trying to say
there is a risk in everything we do danged if we do danged if we do not
taking prudent risks is part of the human experience we venture to cross the street
at a busy intersection but we try to look both ways before we step off the curb
if we want to emerge from the mess we are in we will have to change something
the status quo is not an acceptable solution
neither the government nor the media are  correct we will have to decide for
ourselves who to believe and who to trust for what god gave us brains so we could
think and reason
people need to work to produce to earn a living if they are able it is unhealthy to be idle permanently if those who work and produce are unable to do so everybody suffers
there are very few nonessential jobs what may seem nonessential to you may
be essential to someone who earns their living that way
people need genuine human interaction not just virtual images
when threats to our health exist take actions to reduce the odds of being a victim if
we want to minimize our odds of getting cancer or heart disease there are protocols
we can employ to do that even so there is no guarantee that we will be safe
there really is no human sanctuary in which we can be assured of complete safety
all people over  are not hanging on the edge of life some children are at risk too
folks who live in rural areas where the infection rate is extraordinarily low should
not be restricted the same way people who live in new york city are treated it is
unwise to set identical protocols for everyone when their real risks are different
we need to recognize that our health is our own personal responsibility not the
responsibility of government government can advise but they do not have all the
answers we need besides many in government are grinding their own axes if you
are sick stay home or go to your doctor if you are not sick venture out while using
good sense about masks gloves and social distancing recognize that there is a
very low risk of contracting the virus if you are alone in open spaces or using the
protocols
if our country is economic health is suppressed much longer all of us whether we
are working or retired young or old democrat or republican will be harmed and it
will take a long time for us to recover if we are ever able to return to the quality of
life we have come to enjoy and expect if you are afraid to leave home do not
criticize those who must leave home to provide the economic activity that allows
you to remain at home
we would be welladvised to seek out the things that are permanent and lasting to
guide our actions turning away from the transient and imperfect attractions of this
life in my experience the bible is the preeminent instruction book i commend it
to you
so that is my thinking on pandemic risks i do not claim to have all the answers
and im not about to tell you that consider my comments for what they are worth
and use the brain that god gave you to decide the truth
good night mrs calabash wherever you are

consider buying used or resting what you already have instead of buying new
about carbon calculator
at carbon calculator we believe knowledge is power knowing approximately how much carbon is released in the manufacture shipping and selling of items will help make us more conscious consumers picking to buy used where possible reusing more of what we already have and recycling the things we can no longer use
about carbon calculator is estimates
carbon calculator looks at a product listing and attempts to match the product category to a north american industry classification system naics category if a match is made carbon calculator can use publicly available estimates of the carbon intensity of the naics category to make a fairly precise estimate of the carbon footprint of the item if carbon calculator is unable to find the naics category we will still make an estimate but it will be less accurate
what is coe
coe or carbon dioxide equivalent is a standard unit for measuring a carbon footprint this metric takes into account greenhouse gases ghg such as carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide and more while co is the most common green house gas other ghgs are far more harmful for the environment coe describes the different greenhouse gases as a single unit with each green house gas converted to its co equivalent ex kg of methane kg of carbon dioxide
carbon calculator uses coe to give you the most accurate measure of how much of an impact a given product has on the environment

since then we have gone through many difficult situations and everything was possible through the direct involvement of romanians either by participating in the vote or by the way they understood to respect in an exemplary way the recommendations and restrictions imposed in the context of the pandemic
first president klaus iohannis the pnl candidate won the presidential election and we bravely took over the government then together we managed a very difficult situation unprecedented the health crisis generated by the new coronavirus and we managed to get through this major challenge much better than many other european countries
a year has passed and today is psd did not understand the message sent by romanians in may  it still pursues politics against romanians through the toxic majority it holds in parliament it is an antieuropean antidemocratic antieuropean party independent justice a party that expelled millions of romanians from the country and endangered the future of other generations of young people and children
but the pnl government is doing its job we will soon implement the reconstruction and economic recovery after a very difficult period and we will continue to govern exclusively in the interest of romanians as we have done so far

today gold star father khizr khan was in town when the united states supreme court ruled with the addition of neil gorsuch to uphold president trumps muslim ban our nation was founded on the principles of religious freedom and tolerance yet todays ruling has lent legitimacy to the islamophobia and scapegoating that was a hallmark of this presidents campaign and which remains a central focus of his administration the united states has always been a nation of immigra  nts  a beacon for those seeking refuge from war tyranny oppression and instability weve aspired to govern in the spirit of the words so many have read at the bottom of the statue of liberty give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free and weve all been made better for it immigrants of all backgrounds make invaluable contributions to our communities every day many have given their lives to defend this country just as captain humayun khan did todays decision falls far below those ideals it is unjust and it will be remembered as a mark of shame on our nations history but until then its never been more important for us to fight for an america that respects the humanity we all share we must continue to find power in our democracy and the upcoming elections are our opportunity to do it this is why im running for attorney general  to protect and defend the rights of all minnesotans  but i cant do it without you help us build this movement so we can protect our fundamental values of generosity equality and inclusion join us at keithellisonorgjoin,1

recently president trump nominated thomas farr to a lifetime seat as a federal judge this attorney represented the republican majority in their unsuccessful efforts to create racially gerrymandered legislative districts and in litigation to require voter ids and other measures that would limit access to the ballot box farr also defended the  campaign of senator jesse helms a lifelong opponent of civil rights laws amid accusations of intimidating black voters this no  mination can be quite dangerous since there is a concern that farr would not be able to be impartial in cases relating to voting rights and civil rights the most significant issue of concern is that farrs highly partisan and conservative track record is wellestablished and that he will bring the same intrinsic values to our federal courts as a lifetime judge this could have a chilling and profound impact on cases which come before him httpwwwnewsobservercomopiopedarticlehtml,1

new town administration centre debate one of the most contentious issues this election season is without a doubt the proposed  new town administration centre i believe it is important that you know the facts heading into this election and for that reason i feel that i need to point out a few things for clarity and for contrast when council voted to purchase the old alliston union public school for million i supported the purchase because i believed t  hen as i believe now that at that price this property was a steal and one we could not pass up as we had first right of refusal before that property could go on the open market candidates that are telling you it could have been bid on or bought by a developer are flat out wrong  again we had first right of refusal we purchased the property for the m which was in a reserve and we moved forward with scoping out what we could do with the property and yes one of the options was to build a new admin centre what followed after the purchase was sobering we were presented with specs demolition costs and project costs totalling  and i was shocked at that price tag even more sobering in order to pay for it the plan was to raid a m reserve down to a balance of  conduct a fire sale of townowned properties some of which went for peanuts in my opinion and the most sobering  add  in long term debt not one nickel of this million dollar expenditure can be serviced by development charges  that means straightup taxation on you during the  budget deliberations i made a proposal which was voted down we realized an additional  in  from the benefits of growth i moved a motion to take that  and apply it against the  levy increase  which would have reduced this years tax increase to  i was met with fierce opposition saying that what i was proposing was irresponsible and that that money should and must go into reserves reserves that are dangerously low my motion was defeated  it was defeated by the same people who are now voting to raid a reserve to  believe me the irony is not lost on me and it shouldnt be lost on you for clarity there are only two incumbents seeking reelection that voted against this disaster in the making  and that was councillor richard norcross and councillor michael beattie along with councillor chris ross and councillor marc biss who are not seeking reelection we were also the  members of council that wanted to lower this years tax levy increase do not let people tell you that these were council decisions these were majority of council decisions i have opposed this project from day one and my mind has not and will not change there are no loaded questions when youre running for office questions are questions and some of them are tough ones as they should be but i believe that even the toughest questions are easily answered as long as your position is clear and consistent my position has not changed and will not change some people will do and say anything to get elected  and im not one of them only a vote for me is a vote against this project only a vote for me is a vote against raiding reserves and saddling you with millions of dollars in long term debt that can only be repaid by raising your taxes only a vote for me is a vote against allowing the development community and those loyal to them to run roughshod over new tecumseth only a vote for me is a vote for consistency accountability transparency integrity and honesty and only a vote for me is a vote to move new tecumseth  forward   moreyears,1

there is a reason i left the conservative party a couple years ago there is a reason i have been trying to start a new conservative thinking party here in ontario for the last couple of years the reason is a clear lack of leadership in the party and a clear lack of leadership qualities in the leaders of the ontario conservative party a few months ago this party was in a position to take back ontario with a majority they had a well worked out platform to run on and the  n mr brown had to be removed until the allegations against him could be dealt with along comes a quickly organized leadership campaign and we now have doug ford but instead of just picking up the party platform and running on that mr ford starts to free lance and make up his own platform and a bunch of promises that have not been in any way presented to voters as a properly financed budget the result is obvious from the results in polls as those polls clearly stand right now this conservative party will once again completely fail to meet their goals as i see it we will most likely see an ndpliberal minority government and we will never have the chance to investigate gas hydro plant shutdowns and improper contracts signed for green energy by this liberal corrupt government the only green thing about these green energy contracts is how much green theses companies take out of taxpayers pockets every year so seeing this lack of leadership i started trying to establish a new conservative thinking party that would once again put hard working canadian taxpayers first for a few of you who have been following this page you would have seen a number of requests for the help of people with similar beliefs to establish this party that request basically fell on deaf ears and i can understand why most of you that have traditionally supported the ontario conservative party are loyal people and i have to respect that that loyalty is now a liability for conservative thinking people because for far too long now this party just keeps failing i will again try and get a new party started but will probably rename the party to the canadian taxpayers alliance i hope after we once again go through the disappointment of this upcoming election that some of you read this post again and help form a party that will once again represent your interests with quality leadership candidates i live in the windsor ontario area and would like to hear back from you this is something that is badly needed,1

a genuine disciple february   a highschool friend was torn between his familys religious beliefs his dad had been an avowed atheist since college yet his mom lived a devoted christian life he settled on calling himself an agnostic this classmate became a respected medical doctor even though he still professed he was an agnostic he told me he decided to attend church because it was good for his public image sad but jesus encountered those with this dishonest  way of life nineteen times he called people hypocrites describing nonbelievers pretending they were righteous and holy to be seen by men but they do all their deeds to be noticed by men matt  in particular he condemned the pharisees and scribes for being hypocrites they blew trumpets in the synagogues and streets to call attention to their acts of generosity they prayed in public places so that people could see them and put on gloomy faces when they fasted so others would notice almost none of them accepted jesus as the messiah the barna group conducted an extensive research project asking nonchristians why they rejected christianity  responded that it was because the church was full of hypocrites several issues exist with this as an excuse first people who use this pretext dont know the biblical meaning of the term hypocrite they dont understand what the church is about or comprehend the distinction between a hypocrite and a genuine disciple the contemporary definition of a hypocrite and the biblical meaning arent the same skeptics try to impose twentyfirst century definitions on words in the bible the simplest biblical interpretation of hypocrisy is a religious performance to impress people it is a nonbeliever pretending to live a virtuous and moral life in public without a change of their heart becoming a genuine disciple begins in the heart these people honor me with their lips but their hearts are far from me mat  niv when we accept christ as our savior we are born again and he gives us a new spiritual heart if anyone is in christ he is a new creature the old things passed away behold new things have come  co  jesus enrolls us in his school of discipleship which means we become learners and will learn for the rest of lives graduation takes place in the final phase of salvation we call glorification then our perfecting will be complete the dead will be raised imperishable and we will be changed co  my students in bible college sought to make perfect grades but often failed to reach their goal that didnt disqualify them as students they kept trying bornagain believers are disciples striving for perfection we dont consistently reach that goal john gave the process to follow after we fail if we confess our sins he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness jn  it doesnt say confess our sins then chastise ourselves for several weeks attempting to add to jesus finished work no after we confess our sin and he forgives us we are to get up and continue striving for christlikeness that does not make the individual a hypocrite when he or she accepts gods forgiveness and keeps going a hypocrite is not a person who commits sin on occasions but they practice sins on a routine basis and continue pretending they are perfect a hypocrite has a terminal heart condition that requires a heart transplant a genuine disciple who has a new heart may have a hour bug but takes his medicine ie repentance and will try again tomorrow the church is supposed to be a hospital for spiritually sick people not a gallery of perfect men and women those that use the excuse the church is filled with hypocrites must never go to the doctor or hospital because it is full of sick people the church is a gathering of imperfect disciples seeking to become more perfect in their walk with christ by learning encouraging each other and worshipping god who has accepted them those who accuse true disciples with hypocrisy are the real hypocrites they try to deflect attention from their own brokenness by pointing out a genuine disciples failure not understanding god has forgiven the disciples failure note other characteristics a hypocrite is more concerned with correcting others than themselves they are judgmental jesus is referring to hypocrites when teaching about judging others why do you look at the speck that is in your brother is eye but do not notice the log that is in your own eye you hypocrite first take the log out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother is eye mat   a hypocrite overlooks all the righteous acts the person they are condemning has done they should consider peter who failed by cursing and vowing three times he did not know jesus yet fifty days later god anointed him to preach and  came to christ are there hypocrites in the church yes but the majority are genuine disciples most hypocrites are outside looking in sustaining word for the week have you received christ and become a genuine disciple if you have been accused of being a hypocrite rest in christs finished work and keep going,1

from the moment i met gary i knew he was the type of person i wanted in my corner he and i were community and union organizers in philadelphia gary has always had a heart of service during our organizing days gary was an amazing resource of knowledge and perspective he consistently operated with integrity i have no doubt it is because that is simply who he is as a person he sees the bigger picture and can translate that into long and short term goals and is passionate  enough to persist he does not back down in the face of fear because he knows what is at stake and is brave enough to stand up and fight for everyone garys thoughtful and measured leadership is a characteristic we sorely need in our elected officials today our children are suffering greatly and i am so elated that gary has chosen a path that will undoubtedly shift the landscape of those he selflessly serves when we think of those we want representing us in elected office it is a natural fit to elect those who are already doing the work regardless of title this has been gary since i met him over a decade ago i am beyond proud to endorse him our communities need people who genuinely care and are holding office for the right reasons that is why im supporting gary broderick for school board it is time for change  jamie hamod join jamie and support our campaign by becoming a contributor httpbitlybroderickschoolboard,1

"yesterday you might not have noticed the house of representatives just passed at  defense bill hr
i put defense in quotation marks on purpose
we could get more than adequate defense for half of this price tag who is about to attack us exactly who and what army
this bill is so colossally overblown and gigantic because it is graft it is greasing palms it is payback
it is using public funds to buy political support from those who the money is being spent on
thus it is theft you should be angry
i remind you that the democratic party has majority control of the house of representatives at this time
as a jobs program funding the military industrial complex is the worst jobs program we could have studies show the cost per job is astronomical
what we should have is a green new deal jobs program putting people to work greening our energy transportation and infrastructure instead of putting them to work making weapons we dont need
again this is raiding the public coffers to curry favor and buy political support this is theft
this is corruption out in the open about  or more is spent every year on defense lobbying of congress  million dollars a year
and yes representative delauro voted for it
we all deserve better",1

halloween and the end of the world on halloween weekend after listening to a terrifying and soontobefamous radio show starring orson welles many of the staff members and children at the home for the friendless were scared silly in the middle of the broadcast mr welles announced that aliens were invading our planet he sounded so afraid that the staff believed it was really happening some of the kids were afraid but at eight years of age i wasnt i didnt even pon  der the safety of my little brother and sister in their dormitory rooms on the other side of the building i was curious though what if aliens did invade cedar rapids would they hurt us would the world be a big mess however none of that deep thinking kept me from sleeping soundly that night the next day at school it was hard to do our lessons because the only thing the kids could talk about was that radio show and orson welles the man who wrote the script titled the war of the worlds the teacher even set aside our palmer method penmanship lesson so we could talk about what we had experienced my third grade classroom at polk elementary school became a solid mass of arms in the air with hands wiggling each kid begging to tell his or her story i didnt dare say anything what would they think if i said that i hadnt even been worried about my little brother and sister i wish i had been frightened so i would have something to say arthur said i was scared to death and i hid under the bed for a long time violet said not me i knew it was a joke phillip said it was not a joke just a misunderstanding phillip was very grown up a boy whose father worked at the police station said someone phoned and asked what time is this going to happen a girl whose father was a fireman said a lady called the fire department and asked when it happens shall i close my windows another student said when her mother checked on an elderly neighbor the woman said i dont have time to talk right now the end of the world is coming and ive got a lot to do we all laughed about those stories even the teacher then she told us another story turning it into a lesson while i pull down the map be ready to raise your hand if you know the answer to my question i was not good at geography so i didnt budge there is a college in brevard north carolina where the entire student body panicked during last nights radio show who can tell me what the word panic means phillips arm shot into the air its the button my mother pushes when she loses her marbles phillip explain for the class what you mean by pushing a button and losing her marbles well when our new puppy went potty in my mothers lap she screamed and tossed the pup to my dad my dad said that she had lost her marbles and hit her panic button so phillip do you know what your dad meant by that i sure dont boys and girls the word panic means being so frightened you lose control and do things you wouldnt ordinarily do you mean like my mom throwing our puppy in the air phillip asked thats right now who would like to locate the state of north carolina up jumped bernard mr map himself to point with pride at the state of north carolina our teacher said this is the location of the college where the students panicked during the broadcast then she read from a newspaper clipping five students at brevard college in north carolina fainted and panic gripped the campus for a half hour with many students fighting for telephones to ask their parents to come and get them if a pin had dropped in my classroom we wouldve heard it because all of the kids sat wideeyed and speechless we listened to every word as our teacher went on a radio broadcast is usually heard by the whole country so try to imagine how many other people were afraid last night and how many of them probably panicked every kid nodded in agreement while she continued when large groups of people become frightened by something they cant see they sometimes do strange things to get away from the fear its called mass hysteria and it means that fear is sometimes contagious like the measles that night after supper all of the kids and staff at the home gathered close to the big zenith console to listen to the news a lot of people were really mad about the show being broadcast especially on halloween i felt sorry for orson welles because he probably had no idea what a ruckus he would cause when a reporter asked himbut but what he thought about the commotion he said i apologize to the producers of the cbs mercury theater for this getting out of control the show was only a story and not real thats why we announced a warning at the beginning but mr welles anyone who tuned in late didnt know that the interviewer said the broadcast seemed so real that everyone was confused i am so sorry i dont think we will ever broadcast that program again while listening to the show i had been a little bit confused too but i didnt think it was real maybe growing up with such hullabaloo in my family had taught me to take things in stride when bad things happened in the adult world like kidnapping and bank robberies i felt certain the grownups would take care of it after listening to the war of the worlds the nervous grownups at the home must have caught fear from each other but i was glad the world hadnt ended on halloween it would have wrecked our costume party and i was really looking forward to stuffing my face with candy from the home for the friendless by betty auchard,1

"hello
my name is pat ledbetter and i am running for texas house district  i would love the opportunity to introduce myself to you or reintroduce as i pick my campaign up from where it left off at the beginning of this terrible crisis
i am not a politician as a lifelong educator i had never wanted to hold public office but the current state of affairs compels me to enter the fray i am now campaigning for texas house of representatives because i believe our state legislature is not responding to all texans and that it has left our state too vulnerable to such crises as the one we are currently facing
i begin this campaign with a firm belief that more unites us than divides us however the political process that should bring us together drives us apart even when we face a common and nonpolitical enemy like a deadly virus i believe i can help repair the damage done and create a more positive environment looking forward
the covid crisis has elevated to the top of everyone is concern the four issues that i originally identified to drive my campaign platform in fall  these issues are
 health care texans are literally dying for want of access to health care and even those with insurance cannot afford the premiums and the deductibles especially hard hit is rural texas where hospitals face economic ruin when patients cannot pay their bills covid has brought public attention to just how severe this crisis is
 college affordability as college tuition and fees have escalated out of control students struggle to balance fulltime work with college studies and still barely manage to get by because a college degree is deemed more necessary than ever before students feel compelled to take out huge loans that end up limiting their options and slowing their progress after graduation in the wake of this crisis our community colleges and universities will be the best hope for bringing the economy back but only if people can actually afford the tuition and fees
 public education texas children are not getting the education they need and teachers are getting neither the salary nor the respect they deserve meanwhile efforts to privatize our public schools have undermined one of democracy is promises equal opportunity for all after this crisis many of our children will need extra attention to catch up and succeed for that to happen schools must be better funded
 broadband internet access in this informationdriven age rural areas like house district  are held back by slow or nonexistent internet connections farmers and businesses are excluded from opportunities that should be available to all and young people cannot access the educational benefits that better connectivity can deliver when everything went online with this crisis huge swaths of the country were left behind this should never happen again
i believe this community can make democracy work in the way that our founding fathers envisioned a campaign with wideranging debates can allow us to consider all perspectives on these and other problems and thus find solutions democracy works best when all voices are heard and representatives are responsive to the will of the people if candidates are unable to campaign facetoface i hope we can find ways to enliven debate online and through social media",1

i was flying from dubai to melbourne and i got on the plane and one of the air crew came up and said would you like to take a shower mr proctor i thought she was putting me on i said theres a shower on the plane she said yes but were booking times to use it now so if you want to take one on this flight you have to put in your name i jumped at the chance when my turn came i got in there and it was a big big room on that plane with beautiful heated tile floors it was amazing i just wanted to be able to say id had a shower at  feet now ive done this multiple times but you know if somebody had suggested youre going to fly from dubai to melbourne and you can have a shower a hot meal watch a movie or lay down and go to sleep that would have sounded absolutely outrageous not too long ago how did the wright brothers ever even imagine they could make human beings fly people must have thought they were crazy to try to make something like that happen but they did it now we all take it for granted whats worse is we usually reserve that kind of incredible invention and innovation for other people but let me tell you something theres absolutely no difference between the wright brothers and you and me or anybody else the only difference is the wright brothers allowed themselves to dream they tuned into that special frequency where human beings can literally bring something thats never existed before into reality all throughout history there have been men and women from ordinary backgrounds who set out with nothing but a dream in their minds and were able to accomplish something extraordinary it would seem these people were special or fortunate or blessed in some way that most people are not but thats not the case because what makes the difference when it comes to achieving the impossible is not fortune or favor its decisions and commitments i talk to a lot of people who just dont believe they have that something special the great people of the world must have had to do the great things they did that makes me very upset because i know its not true the ability to do something great to achieve independence and freedom to shape the futurethats within every single one of us but most people theyve lost the ability to dream and thats where it all begins so i want to invite you today to dream again dream up a future where your finances are no longer a source of stress dream up a future where youre no longer fighting to make ends meet dream up a future where you can hop on a plane from dubai to melbourne and take a shower on the way while youre  feet up ive done it you can too all of that is well within your reach and more all you have to do is make a decision to do what it takes to experience those things and make a commitment that youre not going to give up hope until you do if you dream of owning your own business working from home and having financial freedom theres one small decision im going to ask you to make today right now my good friend adrian morrison is an absolute expert at helping people from all over the world achieve extraordinary income results with ecommerce hes putting on a free workshop this week where hes going to show everyone who attends how to setup their own online store how to advertise for it and even what products to sell in it maybe youve heard of people having success in ecommerce today and thought well those people must be lucky but thats not me stop thats no way to think thats no way to dream can you imagine what might be possible for you you dont have to start without a map for where youre going because adrian created this training specifically to give that to you hes even going to show you the exact products hes sold in his own ecommerce stores that have helped him make millions hes no different no more special than you and me hes just allowed himself to dream and hes committed to making his dream a reality are you ready to dream again click the link below to sign up for adrians free training httpinviteesaworkshopcombob youll be glad you did thank you,1

"senator juan dalmau reaffirms his call to ban dangerous glyphosate
bayer company faces  lawsuits for cases d
e cancer in the united states from the use of the herbicide
capitolio puerto rico may   the senator of the puerto rican independence party pip juan dalmau ramirez called on the house of representatives to approve a project of his authorship to prohibit the public use of the dangerous glyphosate in moments where the bayer company announced that it reached agreements that cover between  to  lawsuits for cancer cases in the united states for the use of the herbicide
a year ago the senate approved ps  which prohibits the use of glyphosate in the weeding of highways highways avenues streets and state or municipal roads irrigation canals and any public property to which they were added as co authors senators of all political parties and the independent however the house of representatives did not take action on it
for the pip senator this is the right time for the house to approve the project
at this time that we are fighting to protect the health of the people in the face of the covid pandemic it is necessary that we also defend it from other dangerous elements such as glyphosate the bayer company is facing  lawsuits in the united states over the cancer caused by this product in thousands of people and they have proposed spending  billion to end a costly legal battle the company inherited when it acquired monsanto in  this should send us a message clear message of the need to ban glyphosate in puerto rico explained dalmau
for dalmau ramirez who is also a gubernatorial candidate for the pip baxter is multimillion dollar spending is due to a strategy to prevent more negative information about glyphosate from coming to light
the company wants to show that these agreements are part of a purely economic and corporate strategy aimed at shareholders the reality is that after losing three important cases in court they want to avoid further public discussion of the negative effects that glyphosate has under its round up brand on people is health just as we want to prevent residents of the country from becoming infected with the coronavirus the house of representatives and the government of puerto rico have to take action to protect the health of our people he said
in the chamber the representative of the pip denis marquez lebron also submitted a project similar to that of dalmau but it was not considered either and was shelved in the committee on agriculture natural resources and environmental affairs chaired by representative joel franqui atiles",1

 more users visited the policy pages of the website over the last three months than in the previous three months
engagement with reporters is up and your work and priorities are being represented in their reporting
email fundraising is bringing in  percent more in april  than in february before the coronavirus lockdowns
social media impressions and engagement are up across the board and facebook impressions were up an incredible  over the previous quarter we are reaching new people in the organization is target audience
and these solid numbers are just the beginning every client we work with now has a plan to keep strengthening their online presence for continued success

i saw something genuinely wild and heartbreaking this weekend it was a number of black folk cultural figure types saying that people should not trust my coronavirus fundraiser because it is likely fraudulent they were bold and clear about it white folk loved it and shared it all over the internet it was shared tens of thousands of times  sometimes by people i thought of as friends media figures people with verified accounts folk all over the internet chimed in but i do not have a coronavirus fundraiser none never have never did never happened an outlet called the daily dot  which has millions of followers  then did a whole story on the fraudulent fundraiser i was running where they literally quoted people saying they should not trust it but they literally never even checked to see if i actually have a fundraiser i do not my organizations do not my companies and businesses do not what i have done is build an effort with over  volunteers from all  states we now have communities of volunteers in over  american cities we have helped thousands of people all over the country by matching donors directly with people in need they have paid rent they have paid bills they have bought medicine they have bought rental cars and ubers they have delivered groceries they have run errands they have checked on the sick and elderly and did it all for the love and we have done it all quietly so as to not seem like we wanted credit for the work but we have staff working literally  hours a day  days a week in our operation it is beautiful it is one of the most important things ive ever been a part of and people are literally lying and saying it is a fundraising scam when we are not even raising money here is what i know  and it is a painful fact of being a leader  when you step in the arena when you step up and lead when you refuse to sit idly by but jump in to help people who are hurting and oppressed  you will always be maligned we have read quotes from famous leaders saying as much for our whole lives but i promise you it is true when dr king died on the day he was assassinated he was one of the least liked people in the entire country the majority of both white amp black folk did not like him several polls had his approval ratings at an alltime low now i get it i truly do this nation chews its leaders up spits them out jails them demeans them even murders them  then later tells you how great they were and how much we should all love them,1

"what will a postcovid government look like will we become a nation of men rather than a nation of laws will we be subject to rule by a few or will we retain our heritage of a constitutional republic of by and for the people
we need to ask ourselves what is civil government is purpose the purpose of civil government is to protect our godgiven rights according to the declaration of independence what are your godgiven rights among these unalienable rights are life liberty and property or pursuit of happiness
what if civil government does not accede to the idea that there is a god and our rights come from him then the purpose of that government will be different than the republic our founding fathers gave us
a tyrannical and godless government that has control of your body money and property might look like this
forced vaccinations power over your life
forced business closures and subsequent job losses power over your liberty and right to work
state worship
potential loan payment acceleration possibly resulting in state ownership power over your money and property
surveillance of citizenry control over your life liberty and pursuit of happiness
a government that is a constitutional republic might look like this
personal freedom to pursue your health wealth vocation right to work
personal freedom to worship peaceably assemble speak out and a free press
personal freedom to pursue your happiness ie private property ownership
personal freedom to defend yourself and your family
the kind of government we have when this crisis subsides depends on your stand for liberty freedom is our birthright there has always been and will always be a faction of people on earth who want to control you they are looking for those who will trade personal freedom over life liberty and pursuit of happiness for some false promise of security do not be fooled they do not know what you or your loved ones need you do

my wife rwj and i talked about this very thing at breakfast this morning the emory university hospital statement confirmed what i have know for several weeks hopefully it will clear things up for those of you that dont understand what the fuss and worry is all about we have been fortunate here in anderson south carolina but things are going to get much worse here and if we dont get serious and change our thoughts and actions in a big way we are going to be at a very v  ery very bad place i think we all need to do the right things for the right reasons at the right time everyday and especially now and into the future continue social distancing because it does slow the spread of covid   right thingsthink of yourself as a covid  carrier and act in the best interest of yourself and others think of everyone you come in contact with as a covid  carrier to protect yourself and others treat every surface that you touch as being infected by the coronavirus so as to protect yourself and others help others in need because it is always the right thing to do right reasons take care of yourself and others because we all need to be responsible in any emergency especially this deadly pandemic covid  has no vaccine nor cure and it is highly contagious and spreads exponentially this disease is a train wreck waiting to happen if we all dont do our part to stop the progression now we will be heartbroken and that is a stark reality right time we cannot worry about what we and others did not do in the past we have to look to right now and into the future now is the right time to do what we are told to do by the scientist physicians amp our leaders another thing that we need to do right now is to pray for the whole world my main street program anderson sc  facebook friends be safe for yourself and for all others that you come in contact with because it is the most important thing in the world for the health and safety of us all from an emory epidemiologist who shared the following as an infectious disease epidemiologist at this point i feel morally obligated to provide some information on what we are seeing from a transmission dynamic perspective and how they apply to the social distancing measures specifically i want to make two aspects of these measures very clear and unambiguous first we are in the very infancy of this epidemics trajectory that means even with these measures we will see cases and deaths continue to rise globally nationally and in our own communities in the coming weeks our hospitals will be overwhelmed and people will die that didnt have to this may lead some people to think that the social distancing measures are not working they are they may feel futile they arent you will feel discouraged you should this is normal in chaos this enemy that we are facing is very good at what it does we are not failing we need everyone to hold the line as the epidemic inevitably gets worse this is not my opinion this is the unforgiving math of epidemics for which i and my colleagues have dedicated our lives to understanding with great nuance and this disease is no exception we know what will happen i want to help the community brace for this impact stay strong and with solidarity knowing with absolute certainty that what you are doing is saving lives even as people begin getting sick and dying around you you may feel like giving in dont second although social distancing measures have been at least temporarily wellreceived there is an obviousbutoverlooked phenomenon when considering groups ie families in transmission dynamics while social distancing decreases contact with members of society it of course increases your contacts with group ie family members this small and obvious fact has surprisingly profound implications on disease transmission dynamics study after study demonstrates that even if there is only a little bit of connection between groups ie social dinners playdatesplaygrounds etc the epidemic trajectory isnt much different than if there was no measure in place the same underlying fundamentals of disease transmission apply and the result is that the community is left with all of the social and economic disruption but very little public health benefit you should perceive your entire family to function as a single individual unit if one person puts themselves at risk everyone in the unit is at risk seemingly small social chains get large and complex with alarming speed if your son visits his girlfriend and you later sneak over for coffee with a neighbor your neighbor is now connected to the infected office worker that your sons girlfriends mother shook hands with this sounds silly its not this is not a joke or a hypothetical we as epidemiologists see it borne out in the data time and time again and no one listens conversely any break in that chain breaks disease transmission along that chain in contrast to handwashing and other personal measures social distancing measures are not about individuals they are about societies working in unison these measures also take a long time to see the results it is hard even for me to conceptualize how one quick little get together can undermine the entire framework of a public health intervention but it does i promise you it does i promise i promise i promise you cant cheat it people are already itching to cheat on the social distancing precautions just a little a playdate a haircut or picking up a needless item at the store etc from a transmission dynamics standpoint this very quickly recreates a highly connected social network that undermines all of the work the community has done so far until we get a viable vaccine this unprecedented outbreak will not be overcome in grand sweeping gesture rather only by the collection of individual choices our community makes in the coming months this virus is unforgiving to unwise choices my goal in writing this is to prevent communities from getting suckerpunched by what the epidemiological community knows will happen in the coming weeks it will be easy to be drawn to the idea that what we are doing isnt working and become paralyzed by fear or to cheat a little bit in the coming weeks by knowing what to expect and knowing the importance of maintaining these measures my hope is to encourage continued community spirit strategizing and action to persevere in this time of uncertainty  holdtheline  community  flattenthecurve   thanks for sharing augusta dunse emory university healthcare,1

"i leave the link to my opinion article
the crude reality
silently and slowly almost invisibly the small business of gandia the local one is extinguished without anyone remedying it it is not just about them but about the families that also depend on these businesses for this reason we cannot forget their workers at the limit of their possibilities since march included in ertes and as of today is date many of them still they havent received a penny
it is clear that we had not even imagined that something like this could happen but what worries me is that the government of gandia has reacted late it does not even remotely perceive everything that is coming at us as a consequence of the lack of measures support from the government both selfemployed and workers
the wild break caused by covid and the economic slowdown which we had already been experiencing have turned gandia that commercial benchmark in the region into a bleak panorama streets dotted with closed premises which overshadow that vision of streets full of life as in a bad dream
society is in shock and it seems that it is not aware of the reality towards which it is heading because right now it only has in its head the desire for freedom but we have to be very clear about the consequences that a new outbreak of this damned virus so you have to have common sense and appeal to people is responsibility
from the popular party of gandia we have not stopped working on proposals to help deal with this exceptional situation and proof of this is that many of them have been included in the institutional declaration that we have signed all the political parties with representation in gandia city council to combat covid
those who have been able to reopen their doors with great difficulty despite the uncertainty and fear have seen the harsh reality with concern they open without being able to remove the ertes employees because consumption has dropped dramatically and as a consequence they drop also their income but expenses continue to increase and the lack of liquidity puts most businesses at serious risk of closing
from the popular party of gandia we want to raise awareness of the need to support our local businesses shops hotels services now more than ever since by buying in the businesses of our city we make it possible for the local economy to continue to function and with it our citizenship prospers
we insist to the government of the psoe and compromismes gandia that yes these are moments in which we must support but that does not mean that we continue to claim the need to facilitate access not to block the few entrance roads to the city center promote the commerce of all the neighborhoods with special attention to grau and playa which are in a delicate situation since their campaigns are increasingly shorter and with the restrictive measures taken by the central government and the inactivity of the local little influx they are going to have
for all these reasons we must favor or strengthen all those mechanisms that facilitate liquidity and help all businesses adapt to current circumstances and new purchasing habits but without losing that essence that characterizes traditional commerce and its specialization because that added value they offer is what makes the difference

news from the ripon society walden discusses agenda for the th congress amp the need to resolve the current shutdown debate jan   washington dc  us rep greg walden or appeared before a meeting of the ripon society yesterday morning delivering remarks about the upcoming agenda of the th congress and some of his key accomplishments as chairman of the energy amp commerce committee over the past two years we had a very productive two years the oregon lawmaker stated we passed over  measures more than  of them achieved bipartisan support on the house floor and probably half of them passed unanimously we reauthorized agencies and programs that had not gone through that process sometimes in decades most importantly we tackled the opioid epidemic in america where more people die from opioid overdose than in traffic accidents we approved more than  individual pieces of legislation through the committee and on the house floor that we eventually bundled up into one bill which became law last fall seldom in this job do you have the opportunity to say your work will literally save lives this legislation will do that it will help save lives  walden took the reins of the energy amp commerce committee in january of  as chairman he noted that he was able to establish a good working relationship with the panels ranking democrat us rep frank pallone nj and expressed hope that the good relationship will continue with pallone taking the gavel of the committee this year frank and i have worked pretty well together and our staffs do as well walden said we fought on the things where we disagreed  we fought hard at times but we also worked together to empower our members and pass legislation to solve america is problems the proof is in the product  again with over  of those bills achieving bipartisan support in the house  walden said he fully expects some on the left to focus more on investigating the president than legislating and finding solutions to the problems that the american people face i fully anticipate the democrats will devote enormous resources to investigating anything and everything trump he declared in this case they now have the subpoena authority to back up their efforts but these investigations can drag on for years and the administrations of both parties know how to batten down the hatches and slowwalk responses to requests demands and subpoenas  meanwhile the american people will want results if the democrats yield too much to their progressive activists then how will their grand plans ever make it through the republican senate or across the president is desk you need to legislate and enact laws to succeed at legislating one does have to do more than satisfy the most extreme in the crowd to read more and watch a video of walden is remarks please click wwwriponsocietyorgtosucceedatlegislatingonedoes,1

"of course we must do everything to bring the waiting lists
the closure of our community as a result of corona has also resulted in larger waiting lists in hospitals of course we must have these brought down again as soon as possible no doubt about it
for this there are basically two ways to go
one is to increase activity in the public health system through additional activity the other is to use private hospitals the challenge with using private hospitals is simply that for the most part they want to get their workforce doctors and nurses from the public health service thereby undermining the public health service
on april  the government negotiated the opening of the health service where the bourgeois parties left the negotiations fortunately the government acted quickly and made an agreement with danish regions which ensured that it could be opened as soon as possible but without gilding the private hospitals
it is otherwise an old bourgeois dream to gild the private hospitals all the way back to lars lkke is time when you wanted the private hospitals to fill much more
the agreement made between the danish regions and the government contained two key points
one should avoid undermining the public health service by not pulling too many staff from the public health service to the private one
a ceiling was agreed which meant that one did not want private hospitals to fill more than before covid
now we are in the situation here in the region of southern denmark that a majority incl the social democrats do not want to support the agreement that the danish regions and the government have entered into in sf of course we find this somewhat strange for many reasons but above all we do not think that the current situation which has arisen as a result of covid should be abused to gild the private hospitals and we assume that it is exactly the same considerations that underpinned the government when they made the agreement between the danish regions and the government
we also believe that we here in the region have good experiences that if we ease the ceiling for extra activity in the public health service as we have done during this period within for example the hearing aid area then experience shows that we can settle bumps in a very high pace and for much cheaper money for society",1

"people ask me why would you want to go back and serve on the city council again when things are so uncertain now
i tell them it is easier to serve your community when things are going well decisions are easier planning for the future with your council colleagues is less complicated and funding crucial services and essential agencies is much less difficult
it would be easy to simply sit on the sidelines and let someone else deal with it all but then you hold your first grandchild and you wonder what the future holds for her or for all of us for that matter
so without hesitation im running for th district city council to try and once again help make a positive and lasting impact in this terrific community for my family for your family for the greatest city anywhere that we all love lexington is our collective home and we truly are all in this together
lexington is extremely resilient and i am confident that with solid experienced independent leaders down at city hall we will emerge from the covid pandemic better than ever and eventually regain any momentum we may have temporarily lost in recent months
there is much work to be done by the next city council looking ahead and i am ready to hit the ground running on day one should th district residents see fit to send me back to serve once again on the council
i humbly ask for your vote on tuesday june rd thank you for your support",1

your customers than right now a week ago the president tweeted what was nike thinking its hard to say for certain and certainly the th anniversary of their just do it campaign was in the works for far longer than two months but im guessing what they were think  ing was a whole lot like our th of july emailfb post and maybe a week ago they were more hoping than believing that just doing the right thing was the right thing to do but this week with their sales taking off and their stock more than recovered im guessing they are now believing the same way we do below is a little shorter version of that emailpost if you know of anyone in marketing or running a business or just looking for some hope for the future of our world please forward this to them it matters july rd when i wrote this im sure not every business leader was ready to give these ideas serious thought now a little more than two months later thanks to the courage of those at nike this is the new reality everyone that sells a product or service to people must do their best to understand once drivethru windows were a novelty then almost overnight no one in that industry could survive without them standing in support of your customers values in these times of unlimited political spending may be that same game changer to wait idly by while your competitors figure this out is no longer an option i think the words below can help you to understand how this works and to all at nike who made this happen my hat is off to you for us the risks are small for you huge when the penzey family gets out to visit our beaverton store i would like to buy you all a beer you are heroes there is no more important struggle right now than the shift from profits through destroying our humanity to profits through defending our humanity if we all succeed at this all the rest of our problems will fall into place last week you moved the ball way down field to just where it needs to be i thank you for your bravery july   please share this with those you know in business marketing and with other humans as well  we think weve discovered something what weve discovered is that standing up against everything the republican party has become is really really really  more reallys really good for business i understand how this can seem at odds with the image so popular right now that america is an evenly divided nation but as weve learned this image does not reflect reality and as much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control possibly worse than racist presidency thats just the tip of the iceberg the real issue is the unlimited political spending that brought this president and so many other republicans to power watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like republicans actually have popular support but these days ads and comments are simply part of the many things unlimited political spending can buy yet from our experience what weve found political spending cant buy is popularity this chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of april st it mostly is the tale of just two offers the first was calling out the president for claiming that he was above the law he isnt this is america where no one is above the law no one can pardon themselves the second came with us pointing out that the russia probe has to happen because our president chose a campaign chairman who had accepted  million from a prorussia political party this chairman personally picked the vice president who in turn went on to pick a literal russian agent as our countrys top national security advisor despite being clearly warned by our intelligence community about his past the first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a saturday and sunday but that second offer that big pyramid there just ran for eighteen hours over a thursday night with that offer we received an eightyfold increase in sales over the same time period last year along with the avalanche of orders we also got comments like dont mix business and politics bill its bad for the bottom line i was taught years ago you dont mix politics or religion with your business yet look at the chart this is not  growth this is  times as much in sales in our experience weve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers your customers support you looking at how we evolved humanity really is the gift of cooks and for people who cook to simply watch as republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education attack the environment take health insurance from the poor dehumanize those deemed not white enough and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum these can be heartbreaking times speaking out now really matters if you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the republican attacks on human decency there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now your country needs you to step up and if you are a marketer please be aware that the times are changing maybe its time to stop saying young people cant be reached and instead try to get your clients to look to the values young people hold dear at some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of colin kaepernick by having him taking a knee on the cover of their box in that moment they will lose a third of their customers over  for what i imagine might be another year or two in that moment they will also win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives theres talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences at penzeys we sell spices the very things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence i believe a big part of why spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences each spice every seasoning connects us to a place a time an event that has at its heart our humanity  how we take care of each other make your product an experience make your experience in some way radiate decency compassion and kindness and get ready to be busy right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the republican party has become are being rewarded and thats a good thing unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good its time for americans to vote with our spending my advice is to be a company worth voting for i believe what weve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive this is not the time to be left behind spend every day like its november th bill penzey billpenzeyscom i do regret the impact of this line in that moment they will lose a third of their customers over  for what i imagine might be another year or two i was trying to reach marketers and people responsible for making the numbers work for business and in that world the  yearolds are the coveted group and there is a reality to this with wisdom the desire to spend money to impress strangers fades dramatically that desire is pretty valuable to the marketing world yet as much as the  crowd does not spend like sailors on shore leave they are the ones who marched us out of vietnamnixon are responsible for so many of our environmental successes and with the  womens march taught us how to march again this age group does have a higher percentage of republican party supporters and i tried not to lump everyone in this age group together by saying a third but many still felt lumped i am sorry at some point i will figure out a way to showcase the heroes in this generation so much of the goodness in our lives comes directly from them  and black lives matter racism is real in america and so much of where that racism is made real is through our justice system to those creating the propaganda that taking a knee to bring awareness to this racism is an attack on veterans and the flagjust stop already as any vietnam veteran can tell you through really painful stories the well of support for those who serve in america is not limitless falsely creating the sense that speaking out against racism disrespects our troops may seem clever to those in charge of the current republican party agenda but its a lie and its damaging the lives and reputations of those very troops it pretends to support falsely equating serving our country with the silent support of racism will have real costs and once again the brunt of these cost wont be born by those doing the damage but by those who have sacrificed so much to serve just stop already black lives really do matter  if you like what we are doing please like us and share this not just with business leaders but with everyone who might find value in it and since we have this belief that cooking is about caring for others it means our posts now fall into the political category your comments go a long way to helping overcome the extra roadblocks to reaching people this category puts in our way and if you dont want to miss a posting please sign up for our

a twopage condensed expose of the exceptional christian history of western civilization and the united states of america by apenniesworth  min read many martyrs gave their lives in the  and s wrestling the bible from the hands of concentrated power kings priests and aristocracy held absolute rule over the common person we were just serfs and peasants there was no autonomy the right to choose how one would live their own life or what they would think and be  lieve in  the morning star of the reformation john wycliffe wrote in the prologue to his translation of the bible the bible is for the government of the people by the people and for the people a very famous phrase adopted by lincoln at the gettysburg address the public gaining access to the bible ended much illiteracy because everybody wanted to read the word of god for themselves in  johann gutenberg a devout christian revolutionized printing with the movable type printing press and delivered the first printed book the bible to the common person fueling the reformation of the s in the early modern era s they found the bible to be rational logical and natural therefore they reasoned if gods word is rational and logical his creation must be rational and logical and we can come to rational and logical conclusions about the world we live in baconian principle these concepts fostered the birth of science and the end of much superstition religious or otherwise this ideal facilitated many great christians at the foundations of our western tradition john locke the father of classic liberalism individual rights property rights religious tolerance and free markets sir isaac newton the father of physics and author of philosophi�� naturalis principia mathematica still thought to be one of the greatest works of all time sir francis bacon the father of the scientific method sir robert boyle the father of modern chemistry the reverend thomas reid the father of the intellectual movement called scottish commonsense realism influential for  years plus in the west the reverend john witherspoon disseminated realism into american thought he was the president at princeton university signer of the declaration of independence and teacher of many of the founders of our nation including james madison all these fountainheads quoted the bible and defended the faith the pilgrims in  a congregation of separatist seeking freedom of religion ventured to the new world they tried communal living and their governor william bradford wisely gave up on the idea before they all starved to death and instituted private ownership their pastor william brewster also produced the mayflower compact one of the first attempts at selfgovernance and democracy in our country the reverend thomas hooker who some historians called the father of american democracy put forth unprecedented democratic principles that inspired ideas of individual rights such as due process of law trial by a jury of peers no taxation without representation and prohibitions against cruel and unusual punishment he was instrumental in the creation of the first constitution the fundamental orders of connecticut in  it later became a model for all other constitutions in the colonies including the united states constitution the reverend john wise also said to be the father of american democracy by some historians of the past wrote a vindication of the government of newengland churches in  and many pamphlets in the early s before and during the struggle for independence his material was reprinted and circulated thomas jefferson included many of the rev wises concepts in the declaration of independence the rev wise demonstrated from the bible that god created all men equal and every man must be acknowledged by the state as equal to every man the end of all good government is to promote the happiness of all and the good of every man in all his rights his life liberty estate honor etc the consent of the governed is the only legitimate basis for government taxation without representation is tyranny many of these are part of what was called natural law selfevident truths and natural and unalienable rights the first great awakening a christian grass roots movement of the mid s solidified the idea of freedom of conscience they reasoned that the government or even the church could not stand before god for you so a persons moral and religious decisions were personal and the government should stay out of it this prevailing belief that there would be a day of reckoning also stifled much corruption in our religious selfregulating culture they added the fact that jesus let people accept or reject his message and never persecuted anyone that disagreed with him to bolster their argument for tolerance and disestablishmentarianism jesus is teachings were thought to be perfect natural law especially the sermon on the mount even by nonbelievers and deists throughout history immanuel kant for instance an influential philosopher during the revolutionary period the black robed regiment preachers preached fiery sermons rebellion to tyrants is obedience to god and no king but king jesus the shot for freedom heard around the world was said to be fired in lexington massachusetts where the towns militia from the local church and their deacon the famous captain parker fought the second great awakening another christian grass roots movement of the s placed greater emphasis on mans ability to change their situation for the better in the belly of humanity contemplating equality liberty and freedom the worldwide practice of institutionalized slavery was questioned for the first time in history by government in  the state of vermont became the first sovereign state to abolish slavery all the northern states abolished slavery within  years of our constitution and fought and won a war that ended it nationwide within  years remarkable compared to the history of the world out of this christian movement came the benevolent empire in which women also became highly active in the cause of social reform and were considered a partner rather than subservient to men the reverend charles finney president of oberlin college and influential in this movement was one of the first to give degrees to minorities and women in the early s and worked in the underground railroad to free the slaves the schoolbooks in america were full of bible truths from the new england primer to mcguffeys readers to websters blueback speller for  years the bestselling law books were also full of biblical references such as blackstone is commentaries on english law and locke is two treatises on the law after the civil war the social gospel movement was born they believed christians should work for the betterment of humankind you will recognize many names of organizations still around from this period like the salvation army and the ymca the birthplace of the christian sports basketball and volleyball they were heavily involved in the progressive movement fought for child labor laws unions and womens rights and were still active into the civil rights era of the s on both sides of the political aisle the supreme court in a unanimous decision declared that the historical record demonstrated that the united states is a christian nation a christian people holy trinity v united states  if the founders were not christian then why did all the states require a profession of christianity to hold office some even until  not that i agree with religious tests post modern academics believe they can reshape our repressed primitive animal natures and create a socialist utopia through the power of education they would free us from slavery to the industrial state to enslave us all to a cookie cutter equality inefficient bureaucracy and big government elitist getting rich on our tax dollars and telling us all what to think believe and how to live cultural marxist believe that they can control thought through controlling language thus political correctness was born and history shapes culture so our heritage must be defamed they hate the bible because it promotes many western norms and morals that are directly opposed to the current intellectual oligarchy is postmodern existentialism neomarxist critical theory dialectical materialism and legal positivism ever since the selfregulating effects of the bible and god have been pushed from the public forum every bad statistic imaginable has gotten extremely worse from record stds to  increases in incarcerations drug abuse overdoses divorce to suicides just to name a few but they still push their godless agenda forward no matter the consequences historically just compare the restraint of the christian lockean american revolution to the bloody secular rousseauian french revolution of the same era which the intellectuals idolize that ended in despotism starvation and death as all the many socialist experiments have these differing philosophies have clashed throughout history you could even say the two world wars and the cold war were fought over these differing concepts of government now we fight this battle of ideas from within read the best seller of all time and year after year the life changing bible start your journey in the gospel of john and the book of romans to get started they will give you an idea what the bible is all about the love of god and the redemption of humanity st corinthians  condenses the whole message faith in this message will open the door to true freedom,1

"how different is our life after coronavirus
every day we hear that our life after the epidemic will be completely different but no one can tell us what she will look like from what we see so far it will not be a better one we see some changes because they are brutal dramatic we dont notice others because they are much more subtle
it is no secret that a major crisis is seen by governments as a wonderful opportunity to put the governed back on their feet to bite their rights and freedoms under the absolutely perfect motivation that it is for their good and health
take a look at what we live in romania behind a simulated noisy war with an invisible enemy the government has seized almost all the levers of power and the president is leading romania in an authoritarian way and people like it i draw the conclusion from the survey that  of romanians are ready to give up their rights and freedoms in the name of medical safety it is sad to be part of a minority again
im very worried about a lot of things from the government is total readiness to take restrictive and punitive measures to its total lack of appetite to thaw the economy from our willingness to look hypnotized in the mouths of rulers who say nothing to the appetite of the media to maintain the exaggerated fear of a situation that is not as serious as they present it
i am concerned that our authorities have focused almost exclusively on antidemocratic measures and nothing profreedom
restricting freedom of movement was perhaps the greatest postdecember sacrifice i have ever made the same goes for banning meetings of any kind from weddings and funerals to political rallies
keeping the group limited to a maximum of three people protects any government that wants to perpetuate its political power if we add to these the total confiscation of public communication we realize what kind of foundation of democracy we are about to reach
and all this is done by a party that is just  days old since its establishment a party whose leaders have clogged up communist prisons just to keep us out of the pit of democracy
so how different will our lives be after as long as we allow it to be we the ",1

hello my name is ami dar i am the founder of idealistorg  and i want to tell you a story i want to share this because i suspect that in your own life you have faced similar situations and if you have i believe that together we can change the world starting right now i was born in jerusalem and raised mostly in peru and in mexico when i was  my family moved back to israel and at  i was drafted into the israeli army for three years of compulsory service a year lat  er my unit was stationed on the syrian border and my job was to spend several hours each day alone on a watchtower looking through a telescope across the barbed wire and the minefields trying to spot any strange movements on the other side one afternooni remember it was a cool beautiful winter dayi suddenly had a thought that made me laugh out loud i laughed because the idea was childish but also true in that way that children have of recognizing the truth a few months earlier getting to know the guys in my unit id realized gratefully that some of them would give me their last pair of dry socks if i ever needed them but there were also a few who might steal mine if i was not careful that image was on my mind that afternoon when through the telescope i saw a group of syrian soldiers playing a game of soccer across the valley that separated us and instantly something about the situationthat moment of play their running around like kidshumanized them in my eyes in a way that was entirely new and fresh and different when you grow up in a conflict zone or in any fragmented society it is natural for each side to dehumanize the other but if that filter shatters you can never go back and the moment their full humanity struck me i had that crazy thought that changed my life wait a minute wait a minute i thought if in my unit and in every other unit i know there are some guys id trust with my life and others id rather stay away from then in that unit this must also be the case and if that is true then this whole border fence is running the wrong way instead of syrians on one side and israelis on the other would not it make more sense for the socksharers on both sides to get together and that is when i laughed i laughed yet this idea stayed with me and still haunts me now since then ive learned that life is more complicated and that the line between good and bad runs within each of us and yet i cannot help noticing that all over the world behind every label and stereotype there are people who share some basic values and i cannot help thinking that if these people could somehow work together the world would be a very different place what are these values treating others the way we would like to be treated is a good start but we can go beyond that for example i believe that in every country and every culture there are many people who would agree with this sentence working with others in a spirit of generosity and mutual respect i want to help build a world where all people can lead free and dignified lives and more i believe that many of these people would be happy to work together on the single biggest challenge we all share closing the gap that exists everywhere between our good intentions and the actions we actually take if you are still with me you know what i mean every day many of us would like to respond in some way to what is happening around us but for a variety of reasons we do not we may feel that we have no time no resources no power or no impact we may not know where to start what to do or who to work with we may be afraid of failure ridicule meetings and committees wasting our time getting depressed this list could go on but the point is that this challengeor opportunityis huge think how many times you have felt this way now multiply that by every person whod recognize this feeling and we are talking about millions of missed opportunities for action and collaboration every day now imagine a different world  imagine if these peoplethe socksharers the practical dreamers the twenty people you would take with you if you had to spend a couple of years on a desert island  imagine if these people could easily connect across all the lines that divide us  imagine usyou me and everyone who wants to join us doing whatever it takes to make it easier for people everywhere to move from intention to action  imagine using every available toolfrom mobile apps to a bulletin board on a village treeto match needs ideas and opportunities with people organizations and resources  imagine reading the news and having an act button that would let us do something about what we would just read  imagine if in addition to hotlines for emergencies we also had a hotline for projects and dreams  imagine wherever you are that once a month on    etc we organized idealist days that made it okay and more than okay to spark and celebrate action and possibility freedom and dignity  imagine in brief that together we could narrow the gap between what is and what could be between what we know in our hearts to be possible and the reality we see around us we can do all this and we can do it now we just need to start but to start we need to know where we are going so here is the whole idea in a few words what do we want to change the world from the ground up how by closing the gap between intention and action yes but how by inviting people everywhere to imagine connect and act  imagine a better world a better community and a better life  connect with others and share ideas skills and resources  act on our good intentions and help others to act on theirs who will make this happen the world is idealists idealists yes practical dreamers who want to help build a world where all people can lead free and dignified lives and they would promote and facilitate action and collaboration using every available means how do we start by seeing our shared humanity and then then we get organized plan the next idealist day and invite everyone around us to imagine connect and act and then day by day month by month we continue building a whole ecosystem of possibilitythat act button that hotline a good mobile app to wake up to in the morningso that no opportunity for action or collaboration is missed or wasted as we do all this we will run into all kinds of challenges some of these will be tougher than others but the thing about us humans is that once we commit to a big goalin this case closing the gap between intention and actionwe are very good at figuring out how to get there wherever you are you can make this happen and together we can push the limits of what seems possible in our lives and in our communities how far let us find out if this invitation speaks to you please join us in this group and let us make this happen,1

"these past few months have emphasized the need to have a plan for anything that may arise but no one could have imagined the financial and emotional impact covid would have on our beloved city as a lifelong lexington resident i have never seen anything quite like it
like you i am concerned for the future and how it will affect our families our neighbors and our lexington businessessmall and large
but as my time previously serving on our city council taught me it is essential to follow best practices especially in times of uncertainty it is my nine years of previous council experience and broadbased community service that i hope to put to good use on the next city council with your support we will make that happen
as we are planning and preparing to reopen our community the current leaders at city hall no doubt fully appreciate our most pressing community issues including continuing to provide adequate public safety and essential basic services such as solid waste pickup paving streets and roads and dealing with the challenges of our overburdened traffic system and related issues such as speeding and distracted driving in our neighborhoods
it has been my experience while serving on the council and on numerous boards in the community the strongest communities are anchored in a spirit of collaboration
fortunately here in lexington we are always willing to come together to respond to any need i want to foster that community spirit as we move lexington forward from one neighborhood to the next
i am thankful that my unique experience has provided me with a deep understanding of the systems and structure that already exist at city hall i will not have the normal learning curve new councilmembers generally face along with that background and as a husband dad and now granddad and someone who has called the th district home for many years now i bring a commonsense balanced viewpoint to the issues
being balanced also means being able to work well with our professional city staff while not automatically deferring to their judgment it takes a minimum of eight votes on council to pass any local legislation fresh ideas are sometimes worth considering but if you cannot collaborate with your council colleagues to pass the proposal it will never happen resolutions considered by the council deserve indepth thought research discussion and debate to ensure you have crafted and passed the best legislation it can and should be
one thing i definitely learned as a councilmember is that you should never think you have all the answers thankfully our council and our community is madeup of many different voices and i will always welcome and seek out the input and feedback of my constituents and from our community that enables me to be a strong independent voice for you
the need for a strong local economy has never been more important and i will work hard as your th district city councilmember to make sure we are achieving that
rest assured i have the knowledge of the position and the workings of local government and grasp of the key issues we face to be an effective councilperson for our th district
i pledge to always represent our district well and with competence compassion and integrity
making this a reality is possible with your support i would appreciate your vote on june rd i humbly ask that you cast your ballot for me willy fogle to be your next council representative down at city hall
please consider a donation to help with my campaign expenses chipin whatever you can today at wwwfogleforcouncilcom any amount is much appreciated
thank you",1

violent white nationalist attacks take place at different times in different places across our country but they share much in common they were intended to create fear they were motivated by hate and bias and they are incompatible with our values and have no place in american life unfortunately the current administration has chosen to ignore the threat posed by white nationalists and affiliated violent extremists donald trump has openly stoked these fires he has cozi  ed up to white nationalists  even hiring some like stephen miller into his white house trump has made one racist remark after another he has put in place racist policies from the muslim ban to his ongoing effort to build a monument to hate on our southern border hate crimes spiked after trumps election and last year violent personal attacks reached a year high donald trump wants to divide us  to pit worker against worker neighbor against neighbor he wants americans to blame their troubles on those who are new to our country or who dont look the same or pray the same or love the same even as his administration robs us dry but america can be better than that we can be a country that prioritizes the safety of all our citizens because when we fail to prosecute hate crimes we send the message that the victims are less valued and when our neighbors are being persecuted or attacked or treated unfairly that impacts all of us to take on hate we all have to stand up against it  together thats why im in this fight and i hope youll join me sign on today,1

please let me set the record straight about my niece is brave comments do not let them silence other women by shaming eva i can guarantee eva is not the only one biden said creepy things to that is why the biden camp is trying to flip this around on eva to deter others from speaking up blind biden supporters will attack eva even if a video recording of the entire exchange came out they would claim it was doctored so why should eva jump through their harassing hoops  further if pictures came out the narrative would switch to whether or not she was wellendowed at  i want to protect my niece from further harassment she told her story you can believe her or not hopefully others will be inspired to speak up too she told her story privately on fb because her fellow liberal friends were blinding praising biden and she wanted them to know what he is really like people supported clinton even though he was a known scoundrel they can do the same with biden eva spoke up so that he would not get a free pass for being such a creeper second biden creeped on her when she was a teenager end of discussion i was right there would it change anything if she got the year wrong would it make it okay for biden a much older man to creep on a teenager if he called her wellendowed in  or  rather than  eva is liberal friends corroborated that over  years ago she told them what biden said to her and that it made her uncomfortable why would she do that  just in case  years later he ran for president and she wanted to have this in her pocket it does not make sense but blind biden followers will not think rationally has biden submitted proof that he was not at the gridiron in  did he take de is support for granted and skip the biggest political event of the year in a reelection year how arrogant after attending every year for decades he skips a reelection year and the year he was running for vp he is confident his followers will just blindly support him again it would not change anything if eva mixed up the years but still if biden was having surgery that day it should be easy enough to produce medical records to show it was on the exact date of the gridiron for years eva was too disturbed by this event to discuss it even in private neither one of us thought to document that she was there because she just wanted to put it behind her and move on again why would she tell her friends about it so many years ago the year proves nothing and lastly i can promise you that eva is not the only young woman biden made creepy remarks to the way eva is treated now will determine whether more people come forward or not this is exactly why the biden camp is attacking her to send a message to anyone else thinking about coming forward please do not let the biden camp silence more women eva told her story people can choose to believe her or not she nor i will take their bait by putting her on the defensive my challenge to all of you  especially the media  is this  show eva respect then see if others come forward god bless you,1

recently there have been comments made concerning issues of the city these comments have been made by individuals that fail to include all the facts these comments are usually made by people who dont care what they say or think they will never be challenged i will do my best not to embarrass anyone and offer the rest of the facts keep in mind that the information i offer can be verified by contacting city hall and requesting the city clerk to provide public informati  on the possibility of an industrial park has been discussed many times during the last three years most likely over the past twenty years i proposed to the city council the idea of adding a  or  increase in the city sales tax that would be dedicated to a land purchase for use as an industrial park some cities do this to fund economic development it has to be sold as an investment by the citizens to encourage them to be stakeholders a technology and business center in alma would cost  plus atu in ozark is interested in seeing this idea come to fruition and located between alma and van buren the big problem is money the city has had an interest in improving access lighting for several years one huge delay has been the many street and highway projects that have been scheduled it has been put off for so long we now have the option for led lighting this is a project that has had the attention of many people not a single individual the wayfinder sign project started with the frontier metropolitan planning organization over  years ago it incorporated crawford and sebastian counties active participants are fort smith van buren and alma there are several other cities in both counties that are included but have decided not to participate at this time for lack of funds completion of i is the dream of everyone there are  other interstate highways that will cross i going east to west from louisiana to the canadian border there are  states that are involved in promoting the completion of this road the i coalition has been organized for  years or more to encourage legislators from all of the  states to keep up the pressure this is an effort by many people that begins each day working towards completion the city leadership of alma happens to be part of that effort any expenditure of the city is available by going to city hall and asking to see the financial records on any city activity this has been an option to the citizens for at least  years they are public records and available under the freedom of information act fire department funds allocated by the sales tax ordinance was left in the general fund for over  years city records clearly show that if the  amount for the fire department was and the total expense was  then the  was left in the general fund to help cash flow in leaner times the city records would continue to show a balance of  for that particular year city records indicate that several discussions took place over the years but no changes were made the money was never unaccounted for due to computer records due to the huge expense of fire fighting equipment the fire department will always be dependent on bond money the cost of equipping the fire department is one of the reasons the city will be in debt through  one of our own was recently voted one of the top three elected officials in the region after serving  years this is a positive note for alma we know how to turn them out in  the citizens approved a bond issue that included close to  for parks a wave machine was promised to the public until costs came in at  that would have left the city  short quickly another feature was chosen for a cost of  i arrived in january  before the month was over financial records indicated a loss in  for the aquatic park of  i shut down the secondary choice and implemented some preventive steps to reverse course any bond money spent for parks was approved in the language of the bond if that was not true the auditors would not allow it again this information can be verified through the freedom of information act the key is the language of the bond it is true that smart people are not always smart through foolishness the city of alma lost over  years of planning experience and four members with  to  years of experience we were already years behind in updating regulations from the s that were confusing and contradicting so now we are back to being behind and trying to catch up in the name of transparency quality of life and beautification goals were set by the citizens of alma through the kickstart initiative this was a program by for and of the citizens they were successful i have been a resident of alma for  years and have witnessed the decline and deterioration of fayetteville avenue up until the bond issue was passed in the late summer of  the municipal government let the citizens down by allowing or assisting in the decline of fayetteville avenue so now the mayor failed to enforce the property management ordinance wow there is no mystery who made this statement but who were these instructions given to surely there has to be a name who could this mystery person be that is a question for the author of the statement i would think generally when there is a public disturbance a call to the police is made if a water interruption has occurred a call to the water dept is made if there is reason to believe that there is a public nuisance present then a call to the planning amp parks dept should be made each one of these city departments have a department head that is responsible for these complaints if a citizens complaint is unmet then a call to the mayor should be made these kind of irresponsible remarks indicate a clear misunderstanding that political leaders with very little

one of the things i hear the most when talking to fremont residents is theres nothing to do in fremont i agree that fremont would be a much better place to live if we had walkable attractive retail areas with nice restaurants shops upscale bars and other forms of entertainment sadly our city decided to invest a lot of resources in pacific commons an autooriented giant mall full of chain stores meanwhile our small businesses in our historic commercial districts  are struggling when i first graduated from law school i got a job at a nonprofit community development organization that nonprofit understood that a healthy small business sector provides a huge amount of benefits to the local community so they secured funding for programs like fa��ade improvement grants safety patrols sidewalk cleaning streetscape beautification free business assistance consulting etc my job was to oversee all of these programs i believe strongly that these kinds of investments in small business are essential for a thriving city fremont has so many great assets already but instead of supporting and investing in those the city puts its efforts into attracting more big box retail chain stores one of my top priorities as a councilmember will be revitalizing our neighborhood commercial districts and bringing more thriving retail and entertainment opportunities to our city,1

the us supreme court has ruled in the wisconsin and maryland gerrymandering cases in both cases the court unanimously decided to send the cases back down to a lower court for procedural reasons not great but not terrible in wisconsin the court held that the plaintiffs needed to prove that individual districts were gerrymandered and constitutional harm occurred rather than base their jurisdictional argument on a claim of statewide gerrymandering in other words a plaintiff asserting a partisan gerrymandering claim based on a theory of vote dilution must prove that she lives in a packed or cracked district in order to establish standing the court also holds that none of the plaintiffs here have yet made that required showing in maryland the court sent the case back down for reasons relating to the preliminary injunction issued in that case the court did not rule on the north carolina case however that case has plaintiffs in each of the state is  congressional districts that may address the court is jurisdictional concerns notably in the wisconsin case justice kagan wrote a concurring opinion cosigned by ginsburg breyer and sotomayor in which she gave a roadmap to future plaintiffs for proving constitutional harm from partisan gerrymandering under the st and th amendments and she states that courts have a critical role to play in curbing partisan gerrymandering which is a clear and encouraging statement what now the plaintiffs in wisconsin and maryland will recalibrate their arguments and new hearings will be held at the lower court level presumably any outcome will be appealed back to the supreme court,1

daily operations are gradually reopened
opportunity to save escort time
lss packages will be carried out this summer but with certain restrictions
i am aware that the closure of daily activities has put great strain on many participants and their families we now see that it is possible to start opening daily operations again on a smaller scale from  june
it also feels very fun to announce today that our lss package business will be open during the summer but with some restrictions participants who belong to the risk group will not be able to participate but they will instead be offered other initiatives such as shortterm stay extension of personal assistance housing allowance or escort
finally we have also decided on the possibility of saving granted escort hours for up to six months so that the escort hours do not burn inside when activities have to be postponed due to corona
in stockholm there are a number of important organizations such as funktionsratt sverige riksforbundet fub and the national association of the visually impaired which do an incredibly important job for people with disabilities not least during the corona pandemic for you and for people who are affected by the new decisions more information is here

"still black smoke for the call for contributions to culture
press release of the progressive groups cagliari pd cagliari group sinistra per cagliari municipality project of the cagliari city council
due to the increasingly evident frictions within the centerright majority even this afternoon the city council will not be able to approve the document that would have allowed the offices to finally publish the announcement for contributions for cultural and entertainment activities
we are at the end of may and still the thousands of cultural and entertainment operators who work in the city have no indications from the municipality of cagliari previously the problem was the urgency of changes to the regulation wanted by the majority then came the coronavirus emergency which brought many activities to their knees including those of the creative business culture and entertainment sectors for which the answers are still insufficient both at national and regional level
mayor and council hastily proposed an extraordinary call with some exceptions to the municipal regulation for contributions approved by the majority in the culture commission on  april the vote was then canceled because the method of transmission of the document was not correct
on monday  may the commission examined a new text presented with the same protocol number and the same date but with some changes such as the inclusion of evaluation criteria and the reference to a subsequent call for proposals on this we have proposed some reflections useful above all to make the text clearer and more transparent even in the moment of emergency we are experiencing reflections also welcomed by the president of the commission enrica anedda
today yet another clash in the majority that has led to postpone the publication of a call for cultural activities in cagliari again therefore as of may  cagliari cultural operators cannot access contributions to culture either with the ordinary or with an extraordinary call
we hope that the proposed derogation from the regulation will be approved as soon as possible by the city council and that the call for the  contributions is finally published the operators in difficulty today as never before need clear and quick answers
although we do not fully agree with the proposed resolution at this point we believe it is more urgent that the notice be published rather than anchoring ourselves to formal issues on which we would certainly not postpone in different situations we hope that the majority will finally find an agreement and move on summer is almost upon us and the uncertainties of the health situation cannot allow the nonresponses of the municipality of cagliari to overlap due to political clashes of the centerright majority terribly harmful to the cultural fabric of our city",1

"with the governor planning to reopen the schools september th and with the crisis situations in our country we need do everything possible to provide a safe and secure environment for students teachers staff and families in jefferson county there are four steps that should be considered to increase safety and security in our schools the goal is to decrease a situation where the likelihood of a shooting and the number of children who will be harmed the steps are really four interconnected pillars preemptive response access control hardening classrooms and onsite incident response
 responding preemptively
in order to preemptively stop school violence it is vital to establish an environment that provides solid psychological security a promising track is to develop relevant and uptodate forms and modes of psychological first aid
psychological first aid should be a national strategy used as a preventative measure for dealing with more serious psychological trauma currently the development of psychological first aid can be highly effective in smaller sample populations such as schools a workplace or a religious or social association and can be put into practice in everyday life
as it pertains to schools and schoolage kids the initial action is to involve the students using them as an informational resource can make all subsequent actions more effective survey their experiences and then use the information openly but anonymously so they can see the followthrough
additionally put students in as many leadership positions in the process as possible this grows them and will provide a wealth of insights that the adults might have missed
all of this will build trust and inclusion that will empower the other preemptive actions the students will be your best source of information this generation of young people lives in nearconstant communication but it is not always transparent to the staff and faculty given that there were warning signs before almost all of the recent school shootings many of which were stopped making the students a part of this process is a key
that said these warning signs must provoke immediate action the majority of the shooters have had some mental health or social interaction issues and people noticed the parkland shooter was flagged multiple times yet no one took action
this was egregious but not that abnormal police and school officials have to respond to red flags on social media or in overheard conversations this response must be immediate and highly public that way we can stop what we know about and deter what we do not
teachers must follow due process but fear of overstepping one is bounds must not be allowed to obstruct intervention worries about giving a student a black mark must be swept aside troubled individualsand all those around themare much better served by stopping them from doing something potentially drastic and deadly action must be taken before shots are fired if at all possible
 control access to the school
the second pillar is firmly controlling access to school facilities if a person does not belong in the school or is attempting to bring in prohibited items such as weapons they must be denied access schools must have limited points of entry one or at most two each of which should be monitored and controlled by personnel that can turn people away when needed
school personnel and students must not be able to cheat by opening doors for friends or for parents worse yet is opening doors for a stranger just to be nice convenience must not be a factor if a shooter is blocked from entering a school they are unlikely to do much harm or at least a lot less
controlling access to a school is particularly critical at the beginning and end of the day but also applies during the remainder of the day the question how did the shooter get in is always a pivotal one
how people enter the building and who monitors the access process are a key set of decisions they must be tailored to each specific school too much security or too heavyhanded a footprint can add psychological insecurity to the student body which can do harm even if a shooting never takes place
a balance must be found and maintained this decision
cannot be driven from outside the school it must be seen as part of the school is central culture if students see it that waywhich will require research education as to the reasoning and a deft touch with both students and parentsthey will be far more likely to buy into the practice
 hardening the classroom
next we must do a better job of securing or hardening classrooms as potential targets inside the school classrooms are often chosen to shelterinplace particularly for the youngest kids who are very difficult to move quickly
all classroom doors have windows to allow observation and protection for the children but in an active shooter situation this becomes a liability there needs to be a lowcost fast way of blocking the outside view through the window likewise the doors must be lockable from the inside by the door is lock and with some sort of very simple quickly applied additional blocking mechanism
within the classroom teachers must be able to provide their students both cover protection from gunfire and concealment a place to hide the courageous teacher who hid her young pupils in storage cabinets and then faced the gunman in sandyhook gave her life but her quick thinking saved the children
there are now bulletproof sanctuaries that can be put inside classrooms and can double as story corners while these may be beyond the budgets of most schools it is a good model to provoke the imagination we must devise the best cover and concealment we can find
as a last resort teachers and older kids should also make a determination as to how they might actually fight an attacker with improvised weapons available in the class
the best mode of attack must be specified for each individual classroom grade level and teacher teachers should first be briefed or taught by an expert what is expected of them then the teachers should devise a specific plan of action for their own classroom this should be reviewed and if need be adjusted so that it provides the maximum protection and the minimum of psychological insecurity
once the plan is approved and set it should be published in writing so it is not just in the teacher is head any substitute teacher should be required to review these plans
lastly drills should be conducted first with the teacher alone then with adults roleplaying as the kids and finally with the actual students older kids high schooler is can be told what the drills are really for though teachers should characterize them for younger students as something like stranger drills to avoid any unneeded worry
 onsite incident response
that leads to pillar no  schools must have an onsite response capability that can confront and stop an active shooter
law enforcement will do their best to respond in a timely manner but they will quite often fail most active shooter scenarios are done within  minutes few if any police or sheriff departments can promise to respond quickly especially in nonurban areas how schools achieve this capability is again a delicate decision
every school district or individual school should come to this decision themselves a highly centralized solution is not recommended the how of achieving an adequate onsite response must once again factor in the school culture this is clearly the most contentious aspect of school security
there are four main options  a school can have dedicated police assets on campus which we do in washington and jefferson high schools along with deputies engaged in other schools via direct patrols  they can hire private security personnel  or they can seek volunteer security personnel from the community such as veterans or retired law enforcement
there are numerous options for schools to attain this onsite capability and communities must choose what they can support both budgetwise and within their collective moral structures remember too much security can be almost as big a problem as too little so the right solution for each school is critical
this is about more than just handing out pistols or asking those with concealed carry permits to bring their weapons to work this will involve protocols for the storage of weapons vetting psych evaluations for those who volunteer and extensive training regimens the training must include negotiation and deescalation skills nonlethal control techniques team response drills firearms training and extensive traumalevel first aid
this all bears emphasis you must have the correct people as well as the correct training the firearms training in particular must entail far more than shooting a few dozen rounds at a local range shooting in close proximity to nonhostile personnel is the most difficult gun skill to learnit must be trained and drilled until it is ingrained and only attempted in the correct situations this is particularly essential if we are going to depend on a volunteer or staffbased response capability
the fact that certain individuals will actively deter and respond to threats need not lead to culture of fear among the student body local schools and communities will be able to develop their own psychosocial infrastructure that is compatible with each individual is preferred form of security
some students are more attracted to a physical procedure and therefore will be more likely to respond appropriately based on their training likewise those who are attracted to a psychological facilitation can respond positively and rebound more quickly from the trauma of an attack event
both deterring and facilitating through adequately trained response are necessary to maintain psychological strength and resilience this is needed both in the event and immediately afterward
one final note of action no matter how one of these situations plays out the school and community will be severely traumatized if a solid base of psychological security has been laid beforehand along with the physical security measures the school and student body have the best chance of weathering the tragedy with the least damage
strong followup support must begin as soon as the site is secured and it must continue until every need is met if the young people know the counseling department well from preexisting relationships this can go relatively quickly bringing in strangers may be needed but it not optimal school districts are better served if the counseling department is well and professionally staffed long before any event occurs
these four steps and the followup will not guarantee  percent safety in our schools but they will materially increase that security through deterrence strong defense measures and adeptness in ending the situation as quickly as possible and returning to normality as swiftly as possible

the  election was dominated by something completely new to politics fake news the reasons for this phenomenon are multifaceted but such an assault on our institutions has longterm implications for our country that will last far beyond a trump administration president trump used the word fake more than  times during the first year of his presidency the media were told cannot be trusted cnn nbc cbs abc the washington post and the new york times along w  ith others are fake news after president trumps summit with north koreas kim jongun when members of the media as well as lawmakers from both parties started asking specific questions regarding particular details of the denuclearization process that had discussed and agreed to by the two leaders the president lashed out at cnn and nbc in particular and said once again that fake news is the enemy of the country but since his postsummit comments contained numerous inaccurate facts and false statements what exactly then is fake news in its most common usage it would appear fake news is anything that challenges the president the presidents supporters have taken up his mantra that the mainstream media is nothing but fake news a monmouth university poll released in april  found three out of every four americans think traditional media publishes fake news but constant attacks on our government by the leaders of the government only causes further distrust and cynicism and damages our nations longterm interests the media plays a critical role in insuring that government does not overstep its bounds so that freedom and democracy can thrive however the administration seems determined to diminish the medias influence by denigrating it at every chance and even calling it the enemy of the people white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders refused to back away yesterday from president trumps assertions that the media is the enemy of the american people in a heated exchange with reporters during a white house briefing sanders repeatedly declined to state categorically that she did not agree that the press is the enemy instead sanders blamed the media for inflaming tensions in the country earlier that day experts warned that trumps constant denunciations of the press were putting journalists at risk while ivanka trump said that she does not view the news media as the enemy of the people the president tried to minimize the divide in a tweet later thursday saying ivanka was correct to say the media was not the enemy of the people clarifying it is the fake news which is a large percentage of the media that is the enemy of the people last night at a campaignstyle rally the president ramped up his attacks criticizing the press as fake fake disgusting news and describing journalists in attendance as horrible horrendous people prompting wild applause from the crowd and hours after the administrations director of national intelligence dan coats director of the fbi christopher wray secretary of homeland security kirstjen nielsen nsa director paul nakasone and the presidents national security advisor john bolton firmly and unanimously warned of russias continuing attempt to attack our elections the president told the crowd it was all a hoax last week cnn reporter kaitlin collins was chastised by the white house and barred from a rose garden ceremony for asking inappropriate questions an action that stunned the entire press including fox news fox anchor shep smith said as follows cnn maintains the correspondents association agrees and we at fox news observed that collins was civil that she asked relevant and timely questions of a president who often answers questions under identical circumstances and in the same setting one of our journalists might have done exactly the same for those of you at home if i may journalists are not the enemies of the people its quite the opposite our profession is enshrined in the constitution and the fourth estate holds the essential job of being your eyes and often ears and when appropriate your voice its a cornerstone of our republic the assault on our institutions unfortunately has been extended far beyond the media federal court judges previously nominated by other presidents and confirmed by the senate became socalled judges the intelligence community comprised of  agencies was likened to nazi germany the congressional budget office cbo the independent nonpartisan highly respected agency that analyzes the impact of legislative proposals cant be trusted the president said the department of justice and fbi cant be trusted and of course anything to do with the russia probe is fake news many years before he became president abraham lincoln gave a speech to the young men is lyceum in springfield illinois on january   titled the perpetuation of our political institutions although portions of the speech were about the dangers of american slavery the macrolens of lincolns warning was that mobs or people who disrespected american institutions and courts could destroy the united states put another way the biggest threat to the united states would not come from without but from within shall we expect some transatlantic military giant to step the ocean and crush us at a blow neverat what point then is the approach of danger to be expected i answer if it ever reach us it must spring up amongst us it cannot come from abroad if destruction be our lot we must ourselves be its author and finisher lincoln understood that our nation is built upon the institutions that our forefathers built and that we must at all costs prevent destruction of those institutions from within for over two centuries our society has been built on these institutions including the press the judiciary law enforcement and others the constant assault on them will have longlasting repercussions,1

"the carousel of bans restrictions and paternalism continues
in germany motorcyclists are now being restricted bit by bit people is opportunities to spend their free time the way they like are being curtailed
of course any restriction is always explained in such a way that it is about protecting people but it is not asked whether these people want the restrictions on themselves and others at all
it is no longer just about the cases where the existing and already very restrictive law is violated and punishing this violation it is about restricting entire groups through the misconduct of individuals and thereby completely losing sight of proportionality
after all we are allowed to work and more than  of our wages including direct and indirect taxes are taken from each of us for most top performers it is even  that is deducted and  that remains after the effort of the entire job
we swallow this to help others who have far more than we do very few people know that and you only have to look at european net worth to see that germany is by far the most battered nation in europe
we live from what little is left to us and lo and behold some even find hobbies to escape their professional stress for a few hours
one keeps his house in order mows the welltrimmed lawn with a noisy lawn mower the next grills and fills the area with music still others meet in the evenings on balconies and in gardens party loudly and the next the permanent doityourselfers so to speak among us tirelessly tinker with their houses and properties on weekends drilling hammering sawing
no problem we accept that as individualism after all we are not mice and are surrounded by silence all day long
we usually also have road traffic nearby put up with this normal noise experience trucks hammering over poorly patched streets and sometimes i may allow it sometimes there are even drivers who race with tuned cars and wedding parades that in drive past a neverending queue honking wildly
with all the noise that surrounds us it is the motorcyclists who are supposed to be a burden for people
nobody denies that such a problem for local residents exists on popular routes when the weather is nice
nobody denies that nobody wants that and nobody like me would like to live almost directly on access roads or motorways
not everyone can choose this either after all we are a densely populated country and not everyone has the opportunity to afford a wonderful house in the countryside
consideration is therefore a natural part of our lives and yes we all notice that more and more egoism is spreading and some people think they can do whatever they want
these people must be called to order by the legislature or they must be punished if they break the law
curtailing whole groups with sprawling laws and not deciding regionally and individually how to act leads us to a state of complete control that decides what to spend the last few euros that you have hard earned
apparently the corona virus has developed the urge among some politicians as a side effect to put everything and everyone in their place because it is working so well and is keeping the population politely silent
we have already gone through many groups that are supposed to be patronized in this way and it is currently hitting the motorcyclists who are simply peaceful in nature and even strengthen germany as a business location to a considerable extent
from the purchase of the motorcycle to spare parts and tourism billions flow through motorcyclists in industry gastronomy and trade
motorcyclists have already experienced a lot of restrictions especially in terms of noise protection
what is somehow not enough for the ladies and gentlemen of some parties the motorcyclist itself should be a thorn in their flesh after all the motorcyclist is one of the last symbols of freedom in our country
so a clear statement
hands off us motorcyclists the laws have been changed sufficiently there is no need for politicians who only want to distinguish themselves at the expense of our freedom

ive taken a break from posting but this is something i cant stay silent on  to be completely honest and completely blunt im disgusted  im disgusted watching the video of george floyd being murdered by a disgusting person and im disgusted that this continues to happen in the country i call home  we are all humans we all want the best for ourselves and our family we are all just living our lives the best way that we know how  why does racism still exist in this country why do people of color constantly have to endure these seemingly neverending acts of racism why does the color of your skin make white people specifically look at you like you are a criminal or lesser of a person  it hurts me to no end it irks me to no end it makes me question the country where i live and love  but in the end i get it i really get it  because america has always been this way  ill say it again  america has always been this way  ive been lucky im white  i havent had to deal with someone looking at me receiving that feeling back that they think i am lesser than them like i am worse than them like im about to do something bad because of the color of my skin  but black people have had to deal with this black americans indian americans asian americans spanish americans and all people of color in america  anyone who isnt white deals with racism in america and they have to deal with this every single day  how about that the land of the free and the home of the brave  where all people of color have to be braver than white people to survive and where only white people are truly free  with every racist act in this country it becomes more clear we are a divided nation we are not the best nation in the world we as a whole are a racist nation  not every single one of us not all white people not all americans but enough of us  enough to keep this incredible immorality alive day after day month after month year after year and decade after decade  when does it stop when do we start treating humans like humans when do we stop looking at a person of color and associating a negative connotation immediately before we could even start the process of trying to get to know our fellow human being  the protests make me hopeful the riots make me feel like some awareness is felt but im  years old and ive seen protests and ive seen riots and ive seen them for this exact cause  people realize the injustice they act they believe and after enough time that belief tends to dissipate its there when the moment of outrage is there people believe in it and people forget about it slowly after  its cyclical and it has been  so how do we fix it and to be completely honest i dont have the answer i dont claim to have the answer but i do know its wrong i do know it keeps happening and i do know nothing has changed nothing has changed  in my  years of existence people who are not white in america are looked at as lesser people are looked at as worser people and are looked as criminals and all of those connotations could not be further from the truth  the reason america was supposed to be a great nation was specifically because of its diversity the reason america should be a great nation is because we are an army of people who are here for one reason we are here as a people who immigrated to this land from all around this world to make a better life  to make a better life for ourselves to make a better life for our family and to make a better life for everyone who had that same passion  thats what america was built on thats the sentiment america was built on  and the more we stray away from that belief the more we treat other human beings in our country like they dont have that same belief just because of the color of their skin  the more we hurt others because of the color of their skin the more we discriminate others because of the color of their skin the more we kill others because of the color of their skin  the more i question what this country stands for the more i question what i wish this country still stood for and the more i question how much this country has disgraced its roots  all for one and one for all thats how it was supposed to be all for one and one for all thats how it needs to be gm,1

i am very proud of the positive campaign ive run and will continue to do so all of my messaging is factual and direct it does not intend to mislead nor will it a mailer was sent to lake county residents this week paid for by the lake county democratic committee using pretty persuasive stock photography of an outraged couple purportedly looking at their county tax bill the mailer reads the lake county board has increased taxes every year since the  recession  when you could least afford it they kept taking this is true in fact the lake county board has increased taxes for a  home in cedar crossing a total of  in the time period they referenced an average of  per year in  that home in cedar crossing paid  to the county for its operations in  that home paid  that is right an increase of  mostly to cover rising health care costs a new courthouse and putting money into reserves to build a mental health facility and children is center that same home had an increase of  in school taxes over the same period it seems to me that this ad would be more effective if they were running for school board or if they were running against state representatives who fund the schools so poorly that property tax payers are forced to pay outrageous sums to cover the state is shortfalls if the implication of this ad is that the democrat candidates would not have raised county taxes  over  years i am curious which services they would have cut had they been in power the attached graph highlights the property taxes paid to both the county and the school districts for the above example home in cedar crossing that said i will continue my campaign as i have run it so far i will talk about the specifics of what i will do to lower taxes which will include working with other taxing bodies to persuade them to share services and purchasing power with the county and lobbying our representatives to make common sense reforms that will alleviate the school funding burden solely on property tax payers,1

so matt dowlings latest act of desperation is to go on face book accusing me of distorting the truth about his record and being unable to state facts and threatening me with legal action its interesting that matts cease and desist letter has nothing to do with the actual facts that im bringing to light but is all about quotation marks i guess that it was all really about matt posting on social media about how he bravely stood up to me and forced me to back dow  n in the face of his threats well guess again matt lets just set that record straight right here and now you want facts ok here are some real facts right from my mailers there was a pending foreclosure on matts home until he began drawing a paycheck from the state courtesy of the taxpayers coincidence that the foreclosure stopped as soon as he had that new found revenue stream let the voters considerand decide matt was nearing bankruptcy with collection agencies at the door of his home as it was near foreclosure untilonce again he was bailed out by a taxpayer funded state salary and what did matt do with this taxpayer funded life preserver unlike most people who had been on the brink of financial and personal disaster he went out and bought a mercedes as for matts life previous to being on the public dole he was the business manager of the disgraced kazmarsky funeral home that defrauded over  families of more than half a million of their hard earned dollars that they had invested in prepaid burial plans those are our neighbors our mothers and fathers our husbands and wives funny how matt continues to refuse to explain his role in that little escapade thats alright matt you may yet get a chance to offer an explanationto the attorney general and lets not forget matts pattern of consistently ignoring rules on no fewer than eight separate occasions matt has had to plead guilty to traffic violations including operating a vehicle without a valid inspection and without insurance nice to know how important the safety of your constituents is to you matt and once he did get into office matt took the courageous stand of voting to cut  million from the disaster relief budget but at least matt claims on his website that hes addressing the problem of flooding im sure that thats of great comfort to his constituents as weve been plagued by tornadoes and flooding this year and lets not forget matts vote against the mon fayette expressway a link that is vital to the welfare and future of our region how anyone who wants to represent the st house district could make such a vote is beyond me matt has been claiming that in the less than two years that hes held office unemployment in the st house district has dropped by an astronomical  percent im not sure how many in our communities would agree with that bold claim but i took notice that matt doesnt offer specifics as to where these jobs are and what he did to create them i will say that the businesses that ive built in our region throughout the years have created hundreds of jobs in comparison ive never been able to find a single employee aside from matt in his company coordinated  finally its a fact matt that in my last year in office as a member of the minority party i brought  million back to our communities how about you in your first year as a member of the majority matt ill stand toe to toe with you on that any day of the week well matt you asked for facts and there they are if you think that your halfhearted threats can scare or intimidate me bring it on im going to keep on exposing your record so just wait and see what comes next im just getting started,1

"is tampa bay times still relevant
what is the purpose of journalism
journalism is a method of inquiry and literary style used in social and cultural representation it serves the purpose of playing the role of public service machinery in the dissemination and analysis of news and information
what is a journalist is oath
the journalist is creed is a personal affirmation of journalism ethics written by walter williams in 
what are the universal principles that guide journalism
five core principles of journalism
 truth and accuracy
 independence
 fairness and impartiality
 humanity
 accountability
what are the ethical responsibilities of a journalist
ethical journalism has to be fair and truthful a journalist must take responsibility for their work provide contextual information update their work to fit with current changes when necessary identify their sources with clarity and ensure that they understand the motives of their sources
why do journalists need professional ethics
one of the major reasons journalists need professional ethics is the fact that these ethics can act as a fantastic guide to help journalists deal with ethical situations that they encounter in the course of performing their duties
i believe that the tampa bay times tbt acts more and more like a social media platform and has been slowly moving away from the five core principles of journalism after tbt is latest round of endorsements in this election cycle the paper took a giant leap further and further away from journalistic objectivity and integrity
i will use three specific political endorsements made by the editorial board of tbt and test the core principles against them keep in mind this is a solo effort i have limited resources to compare with the limitless resource and access that the paper has also when the editorial board of any journalism paper is involved in a decision they have a fiduciary duty to adhere to the the five core principles of journalism
school board district  np
tbt endorsed karl nurse in this district
let us test this endorsement against some of the five core principles of journalism
fairness and impartiality i cannot see how endorsing a wealthy business owner who has no issue taking a political demotion as a prior city council member to run for school board is fair he does not have any experience at the k school level relevant to the position except the adoption of one school in one specific neighborhood
humanity any responsible business should practice social corporate responsibility especially journalism we all have a duty to improve our environment it is not all about dollars and cents as a matter of fact the wiser business executives will tell you that social corporate responsibility and community engagement significantly improves the bottom line having said that by backing karl nurse tbt would like us to believe that a whiteonly school board is appropriate for our diverse public school system and our county
i do not think so we need diversity that can lead to inclusion at all levels of government and the fact that the editorial board failed to deliver this diversity by not choosing a wellqualified teacher and public school advocate is a degradation of the integrity of journalism
school board district  np
here tbt endorsed laura hine
let us test this endorsement against some of the five core principles of journalism
truth and accuracy i happen to be a parent at the school where mrs hine would like to claim credit i can tell you this endorsement is totally wrong did the editorial group of tbt reach out to a representative population of the school to validate her claim
no
i have been at the school for  years where this candidate tries to claim credit here is the truth i was there and tbt was not during my daughters last  years the north shore zone shifted  blocks to the south side to help improve minority students achievement the presence of these kids prompted a bulk of white wealthy parents to leave the school this exodus brought the school grade to a d we stayed and continually supported the school which despite the grade continually has had wonderful teachers and enriching programs over time the achievement gap leveled off and the school was a b when we registered our son jb for kindergarten and has bounced between a b and c ever since including  when laura hine joined my family and her group friends of north shore elementary fnse butted heads often over inclusion as a necessary component of diversity it is not enough to get a token seat at the table we need to be welcomed as equal stakeholders there was a total lack of understanding of the nuances between equality and equity all of mrs hine is programs were equal but not every student had equal access to these programs the group could not understand that the initiatives and programs they championed ignored social cultural opportunity and socioeconomic differences in our population that actually increased the achievement gap in spite of our attempts to inform them mrs hine got white parents to come back to the school in greater numbers but was this reverse migration better or worse for the marginalized students that were doing well before let us look at the available equity data at our disposal
the data reflects that disadvantaged students at north shore elementary are falling behind other students in the state and the achievement gap at the school is increasingly significant
the school is  white  black  hispanic and  other low income students made up  of the school population
the data also reflects that some student groups are not getting the support they need to succeed the suspension rate of white children is only  while all other groups combined suspension rate is  these issues show up in areas of academic rigor as well as there are no black children identified as gifted at north shore
with this endorsement the tbt is rewarding and praising these citizens for finally performing their civic duty to engage with their public school while failing the most vulnerable for the sake of accuracy mrs hine was always running for office from the time i met her this notion that she opted to run to save our public schools against the tyranny of a proprivate school candidate is inaccurate and frankly laughable
accountability if tbt had done due diligence in this endorsement they would have at least requested north shore elementary pta is meeting minutes to verify her claims in this case they would have noticed the many ways in which diversity and inclusion were not deliberate but more of a burden to bear by the fnse members of the pta a recurring line item mentioning teachersstaff pay by the pta would have also raised some concerns
pinellas tax collector is office
here tbt endorsed an employee of the pinellas tax collector is office joyell bobala who quit her job at the office just in time to run
this is the only example where i actually have available performance data on both candidates recorded by the entity in question the critique of this endorsement is strictly data driven after i made a thorough public records request which tbt would have been ethically required to do but clearly did not my conclusion of this endorsement is that it goes against all five core principles of journalism truth and accuracy independence fairness and impartiality humanity and accountability
this endorsement is such a gross dereliction of duty the tbt editorial board took the opinion of the former tax collector diane nelson as the primary motivator for its decision rather than facts and evidence this endorsement is intentionally without journalistic integrity and is based solely on gossip and political favoritism
let us dive into the data available for debate and analysis
it is evident that the current tax collector adopted a modernized and datadriven model to serve the county residents this action insulted the previous tax collector and she is now fully engaged in an effort to replace him with mediocre lowlevel staff loyal to her and the past
we will stick with the available data
according to the endorsement mrs nelson stated that wait times doubled the record showed the following wait time in fact doubled while customer and employee satisfaction are at their highest
why is this
customer and employee satisfaction are the best indicators of performance by any service provider customer satisfaction is not simply based on wait times but in the accuracy of the transaction and the fewest number of visits needed to get the job done it is an overall experience between the customer and the employee the data shows that although wait times were less under mrs nelson customer satisfaction and employee is efficacy were also lower let us see the raw data for customer followed by employee satisfaction rating
customer satisfaction in   in    
overall employee satisfaction of pinellas county tax collector employees from  to  is 
the endorsement of the candidate also included one comment from an employee engagement survey any reasonable individual would agree that it is impossible to please everyone however picking one negative comment when the preponderance of the survey results were very positive is deceptive and selfserving at best
according to the employee engagement data i received the majority of employees were quite satisfied and happy with their working environment
here are some recent positive comments from the same survey regarding the current tax collector
 the leadership is to be commended for their efforts to address last year is survey feedback i have personally seen enhanced effort at building transparency and accessibility the info presented at in service day this year was the most straightforward it has ever been and many decisions were clearly made with the employees best interests in mind
 my answers have changed a lot over the years every year i notice more and more improvement i dont remember the last time i was able to choose strongly agree agree for every question thank you for continuing to make this a great place to work and each time we need you to you show us you care about our health safety wellbeing it is noticed and appreciated
 by far this is my favorite job ever from the training program to the people there isnt anything i would change
if i were to play the same unethical game that tbt is engaged in i would look at employee engagement surveys from when mrs nelson was in charge and pick the following comments
 sometimes i feel like the time waited issue gets in the way of customer service there is such a concern in getting the customers in and out as fast as we can it can lead to rushing through situations where mistakes are made on a registration title or driver is license this then reflects poorly on the employees review i understand and it sure seems the customers do too that waiting for issues at the dmv is a way of life and we do it really well here but rushing through customers albeit can lead to good times but it can also lead to mistakes on the paperwork i dont think we should slow down for slow down sake maybe just put less emphasis on the time issue and more on the  mistake issue
 mean what you say even in the top left corner of the page i am looking at it says world class service anytime anyplace that is not what is preached it is all about getting people out the door and keeping times below the red dont answer questions for people outside of work dont offer services of other county offices
 be fairer and avoid favoritism when promoting an employee be more careful in choosing the right person with the preparation and abilities needed to effectively exercise a supervisory or position we observed several times how unfair is gone when the promote an employee
 stop the favoritism a lot of people get promotions or moved to a different area of the office because they are liked more then sic others or because of who they are related too this has happened for a long time but it is happening more now then sic ever
the data also shows a more diverse executive leadership team something that mrs nelson was not concerned with and i am afraid with this endorsement neither is tbt the agency is website depicts an agile and responsive front line to the rapidly changing needs of the citizens i also see an agency moving towards increasing accessibility specifically online and through kiosks in grocery stores this approach is proactive and forward looking
a significant data point that is often overlooked is the amount of retirees that occur with new leadership the amount of retirees did not significantly change over the past three years usually the dire and ineffective environment portrayed by mrs bobala which is amplified by mrs nelson should have yielded a noticeable increase in the number of retirees yet there was no such an exodus of eligible employees to retire   retirements   retirements   retirements
let us look at joyell bobala as a candidate according to public records the candidate was given a lateral transfer for failure to perform mrs bobala was supervising the tax administration department at that capacity she interviewed hired and trained  new employees from  to  and mrs bobala failed to retain any of her own recruits while the entire tax collector is office turnover rate for new hires was  for the same time period including her  turnover rate given her past statements about the value of standardized training this failure is not a surprise
do we still need journalists
as popular as social media is we still need journalists social media news is constantly clouded with people is opinions so we need journalists to report clarify and fact check everything we see and hear on social media what can we do when our journalists are acting like a biased opinionbased platform that is no different from unchecked social media
i say we need to call them out and hold them accountable to the values and principles of their profession their objectivity is needed in order to sustain our democratic system there is nothing more valuable than a free press to our system of government this is why we should not accept this bought and paid for form of journalism i am annoyed and disappointed that i must fact check my local paper and it brings no joy editorials represent the institutional opinion of the tampa bay times the collective opinions of the chairman and ceo paul tash editor of editorials tim nickens and editorial writers elizabeth djinis john hill and jim verhulst tell us that we should elect a fully white school board that includes an inexperienced parent who became aware of our public schools issues only when it affected her family and lastly tbt would like to tell us that our tax collector is office is better off in the hands of a low level unproductive and bitter ex employee that does not believe in standardized training for all as a means to bring equity in our public service system
is tbt against racial justice equitable schools and fair workplaces
i cannot tell but what i can tell for sure is that tbt has not been a friend in the fight for a better and inclusive community that can work for all
it is not a zero sum game

"here is how we make sure bardstown rd survives covid
bardstown rd is the heart of the highlands and will only reach its maximum potential by burying the power lines allowing us to invest in a world class tree canopy this will be especially critical as we deal with the longterm implications of covid rebuilding our local economy and addressing climate change
without a vibrant bardstown rd the highlands will suffer we were already seeing hints of a decline and now with the challenges facing small businesses moving forward it is critical that we create an environment that gives them the best chance at success this long overdue investment will pay for itself many times over by dramatically improving the quality of the street while increasing property values and thus taxes it will create an even more vibrant street that attracts hundreds of thousands more visitors a year who will increase sales at existing businesses and also incentivize new businesses to move to the corridor
the traffic and lighting study is a much needed move in the right direction but with the changed economic environment these updates are not enough to alter the longterm trajectory of the street or to ensure our neighborhood continues to thrive for the foreseeable future while bardstown road was once the only cool kid on the block we now face competition from many other areas of town in attracting visitors and businesses despite bardstown rd being one of the most valuable corridors in the state generating many millions of dollars in tax revenue yearly and clearly in need of investment many will ask how can we afford this project
phase  would run from taylorsville rd to broadway approximately  miles encompassing  properties assessed at nearly  million hundreds of small businesses occupy those properties including at least  restaurants that avg over a million dollars in sales each those restaurants alone yearly generate over  million in sales taxes hundreds of thousands in occupational taxes and millions in other feestaxes a ten percent increase in property values of just the adjacent properties an amount that understates the potential increase in value that will be provided by this investment in the streetscape alone would generate several hundred thousands more a year in just property taxes additionally with these improvements i estimate at least  additional visits to the street yearly generating  million in additional business sales and hundreds of thousands in additional tax revenue including sales taxes occupational taxes and parking meter revenue all added to louisiville is coffers
how does one even begin to quantify the value of having a world class street to the tens of thousands of people who live adjacent to it and to the hundreds of thousands of people who use it work along it daily and who will have a much better experience be it the reduced temperatures and shade in summer or the esthetic improvement in winter there is no doubt this is a dramatic improvement in the quality of the built environment while that value will not be measured in cash there is no doubt that our community will value it tremendously
louisville gas and electric company has publicly estimated the cost of burying the power lines at roughly  per mile lets conservatively double that cost and add another  million to plant and maintain around one thousand  inch trees the  million invested in this project will be almost doubled in just the increased property values and this investment will generate millions of dollars a year in additional taxes dramatically improve the experience of all those who use the street attract many more visitors and ensure the success of the bardstown rd and the highlands for generations
the most valuable investments we can make as a community are ones that improve the quality of life for existing citizens and support existing businesses keep in mind we spend exponentially more than the cost of this project on convention centers luxury hotels sports stadiums and widening our interstates all without even batting an eye
we have all enjoyed the cleaner air and lack of traffic during the shutdown and now that we understand more clearly the value of curbing vehicle and industrial pollution we can never go back we must recognize the world and city have changed and prioritizing investments that improve public health and create more livable and enjoyable spaces must be our community is priority moving forward
please share so more people can see for themselves the beautiful street we are missing out on thanks dan

it is a sad day in politics when the most important thing to some folks is holding on to a seat by any means including baseless and unsubstantiated attacks not about policies or issues but distortions of reality meant to distract voters from the real needs of the district it is not about me the senate seat or winning by any means it is about listening to sd residents and making sure their needs are the priority my family and their wellbeing is also important to me  which is why i care so much about making sure all oregonians have access to affordable healthcare and oregonians do not have to decide between taking care of a loved one or making rent family comes first since family matters so much my brother curtis wrote and submitted the following letter to a number of pamplin papers recently my name is curtis gallia and id like to set the record straight nearly  years ago my brother charles gallia  currently running for senate district   and i changed our last name from stoudt to gallia charles and i disagree on a lot of things including our political views hes a democrat and im a proud tea party supporter but despite our differences some things we share are honesty and integrity so it burns me that anyone would question charles honesty especially when it comes to our familys good name i was born three months after our father clarence was killed by a drunk driver left to raise us by herself our mom did the best she could and eventually remarried her husband adopted me my sister and charles and we all became stoudts many years later after our mom and stepdad divorced our paternal grandmother elizabeth lay dying in the hospital as charles and i sat by her bedside she held one of each of our hands in hers and squeezing her hands tightly around ours she looked up at us and asked that we change our name back to gallia we both of course agreed and we did fulfill our promise we even went together to the courthouse to file the paperwork so its offensive to me to my family and to the integrity of the gallia name that senator olsens team would assert that my brother would change his name for any other reason than to fulfill the dying wish of our grandmother i stay out of politics but they went too far nothing is more important than family one thing charles and i can agree on curtis gallia and below is a picture of me and my sister charlene on our fire truck for your enjoyment thank you for your support,1

"can i tell you something im proud of when we started this campaign our average donation online was about  lately that number keeps going down and down now it is about  why because millions of americans want to play their part in beating donald trump even if they can only give five or ten bucks that gives me so much hope
but with that average number going down it will take a lot more individual donations to raise even the same amount we did online last month so if you could chip in  now that would be a big help as we try to compete with the bestfunded incumbent of all time and support democrats across the nation",1

"in moving forward with my campaign there are objectives that i will commit to the citizens of this county these are in no certain order and will be considered a work in progress throughout my term as commissioner
the first objective is we have we must move to being a proactive commission versus a reactive commission that becomes cornered into decisions that are not in our best financial interest too many times we have been forced into a decision because of the inaction to provide solutions early on roads and trash are perfect examples
the second objective is becoming truly a transparent commission i support posting video feeds of each public meeting to allow those who are sick and shut in to view in the comfort of their own home the good news here is we have begun to do so with commissioner meetings we just have to perfect it perfect it by having all meetings recorded and having adequate audio so people can hear in addition to video feeds we will quit playing the quorum game when it comes to public meetings what does that mean well many times meeting are carefully set up without a quorum present  or more commissioners to disallow the legal requirement to hold the meeting in public form we will schedule lake authority meetings in the evenings so people who work can attend those meetings we are dealing with a m project largest the county will ever do paid for by the taxpayers so it is only right to provide a convenient time for citizens to attend
the third objective is to formulate a longterm trash solution overall the solution to our trash problem is multiple fold we have aging trash trucks and dumpsters we have folks digging in the trash we do not have a local dump for household trash and we have folks throwing trash out not in the dumpster the first decision that has to be made is is grady county going to stay in the trash business or are we going to source it if we are in we gotta make some capital investments if we are out we gotta get out sooner rather than later because our resources are deteriorated once we decide that we got to put an action plan in place my initial thought is yes we should be in the trash business which would include capital investments such as a landfill garbage truck and dumpsters currently our landfill owned by the city only takes white goods and nonhousehold garbage in a matter of years the landfill will be completely closed imagine the trash problem we will have then when a major storm hits and contractors have nowhere local to dump tree debris and damaged construction materials
the fourth objective is to provide a longterm fix to our aging roads and infrastructure the tsplost proposed will certainly fast track any solution unfortunately i do not like the idea of a new tax but folks our roads and infrastructure has been badly neglected for decades and without a boost from the tsplost we could be decades out providing an adequate solution i like the idea of the tsplost as  it is not solely on the back of the property owner  everyone even those that pass through the county pays something  unlike the splost which can be assigned across several projects the tsplost can only be used for transportation
the fifth objective is to gain nd amendment sanctuary status for grady county there are bills introduced into the georgia legislature frequently that try to infringe upon your right to bear arms some go as far to include semiautomatic guns which would include many sporting shotguns i support grady county to join the  other counties in georgia to become a nd amendment sanctuary
the sixth objective is progress on the tired creek lake project the constant financial drain this project has placed on our county has left us with back to back record property tax increases with diminishing services provided to the citizens the roads are filled with potholes the removal of dumpsites have left many citizens driving miles to dump their trash and our public safety has been impacted not receiving needing resources
these six objectives are just the beginning stages of us making a difference in grady county together we will make a positive impact for generations to come and together we will hit the bullseye
i commit to the citizens to use my experience and education to approach these objectives in a financially responsible way if there has been any time that we needed financial expertise on the commission board it is now due to covid there most certainly will be funding cuts from the state to include less money allocated to grants now is the time to make every dollar count each decision has to be a road map to the end goal of not increasing the mill rate at budget time we all have felt the financial crunch from covid and have adjusted our spending to live within our means it is time our county government does the same
i would welcome your support to be your district  commissioner early voting is going on now at the courthouse vote early so you dont forget on election day votejordan gradynewdirection

strength has been and continues to be the bipartisan foreign policy establishments consensus approach it is evident in donald trumps aggressive trade war against china which has generated losses and hard feelings on both sides that may come to dwarf the costs associated with intellectual property theft by comparison it is also evident in a recent advertisement from the joe biden campaign which portrays trump as having rolled over for the chinese rather than demand at the outset that american scientific and medical personnel be admitted to china to help respond to the coronavirus  as for the treaty rights of the native peoples the united states has violated them ever since john marshalls wrongly decided opinion in cherokee nation v georgia in  marshalls conclusion if the cherokee nation have rights this is not the tribunal in which those rights are to be asserted was in effect a tacit authorization to the advocates of ethnic cleansing to commit their genocide and pressure the native peoples east of the mississippi onto the trail of tears  when trump seeks to wipe a native people off the mapby denying the mashpee wampanoag the territorial basis of their nationalityhe is continuing what the genocidal policy of the s left undone  the equality of all international persons as james wilson made clear in his law lectures in  is what membership in the society of nations is all about this equality of nations is the great and general foundation of national rights in this matter no regard is had to names of the great theater of the world empires kingdoms commonwealths principalities dukedoms free towns are all equally imperial a society which without subordination to any other exercises within itself all the essential powers of society is sovereign and has all the rights of a sovereign and independent state however narrow its territories however small its numbers may be  as early as july  wilson had insisted to the continental congress that we have no right over the indians whether within or without the real or pretended limits of any colony  years before thomas jefferson wilson had written that all men are by nature equal and free  slavery wilson wrote is unauthorized by the common law and is repugnant to the principles of natural law  well aware of the compromises he had made over the existence of slavery in the constitutional convention wilson still looked forward to the future with hope at last however the voice of nature intelligible and persuasive has been heard by nations that are civilized at last it is acknowledged that mankind are all brothers the happy time is we hope approaching when the acknowledgment will be substantiated by a uniform corresponding conduct the american people wilson maintained in chisholm v georgia in  are meant to be sovereigns without subjects  this wasand isa succinct way of stating the most basic ideal of the american revolution and the most basic principle of american social democracy it took the civil war and the civil rights movement to begin to make wilsons vision of the american people as sovereigns without subjects true for african americans it took the suffragists and the womens movement to begin to make this vision true for american women and it took the emergence of trade unions and the labor movement to begin to help keep workers from being made into the subjects of those who employ them if the promissory note of which martin luther king jr spoke was written on the account of the framers of the constitution it was wilsons signature on the check ultimately we must seek to extend the redemption of that promissory note to all the worlds peoples to treat all with justice and to repudiate the arrogance and bullyingsome would say the imperialismthat has all too often marred our policy wilson argued thatas the natural law of sovereignsinternational law was ultimately of divine origin the first and most necessary duty of nations as well as of individuals was to do no harm but they were also commanded to do good to one another sociability was part of the law of nature for nations as well as for individuals  drawing on this vision of a divinely mandated international sociability under the rule of law wilson gave voice to the most radical foundation for american foreign policy that has ever been articulated it may perhaps be uncommon but it is certainly just to say that nations ought to love one another the offices of humanity ought to flow from this pure source when this happily is the case then the principles of affection and friendship prevail among states as among individuals then nations will mutually support and assist each other with zeal and ardour lasting peace will be the result of unshaken confidence and kind and generous principles of a nature far opposite to mean jealously crooked policy or cold prudence will govern and prosper the affairs of men  if the goal of life as senator bernard sanders and others over the years have suggested is to bring us together in love and compassion then we might think about this goalfor each of usas one of cultivating the fullness of our humanity andfor all of usas building a more just and democratic society and a more perfect union not only within the united states but in the wider world as well  there will be a great need after the crisis of the current pandemic has passed for a global green new dealincluding a green marshall plan for the most devastated countries seeking to rebuildand only together through such a program will the world be able to grapple with climate change there is a place in responding to such need for american leadershipbut the leadership of generosity not of bullying a healthy society should know that it rests on the fellow feeling that its nationals have for one another and know that this feelingthis affinityis in its own dim way part of the love out of which the universe is made such a society should seek to avoid acting out of fear and to the extent possible act instead out of a concern for the common goodincluding the global common goodwhose advancement will ultimately best serve its own interests the heart of a social democratic foreign policy is not much more complicated than that a vision of sharing enlightened selfinterest with all nations willing to joinon the basis of juridical equalityin that endeavor the heart of a democratic socialist foreign policy is even more simple if perhaps more militant a visionlike james wilsonsof sharing love  see kermit l hall and mark david hall editors the collected works of james wilson in

"sanction china it is about time our congress acts and pushes back against the chinese communist party they have overstepped and are getting caught in lies promoting propaganda and trying to violate the agreement with the world concerning hong kong in my opinion
per bloomberg the house of representatives is poised to give final passage wednesday to legislation that would sanction chinese officials for human rights abuses against muslim minorities the latest in a series of moves by congress and the white house to put pressure on the beijing government the measure was approved by unanimous consent in the senate earlier this month and it has broad support in the house amid rising criticism of china over trade its handling of the initial coronavirus outbreak and its attempts to put down antigovernment protests in hong kong president donald trump on tuesday declined to say whether he would sign the legislation if it passed the house saying it was being reviewed at the white house china has threatened retaliation over efforts in the us to exert pressure over human rights issues the house vote comes as relations between the world is two biggest economies are at a low point

executive director statement on  december  restinpower and end of the year fundraising i began volunteering as a board member with swopusa in the fall of  i had been doing sex work formally for  years and had been doing social justice organizing for  i was raised as a liberal feminist and considered sex work to be a violation i actually protested a girls gone wild recording at a bar in my college town im ashamed of it but it happened at a certain point i r  an out of money and had to take some time off of school i worked retail and it was grueling and i was constantly harassed by mall customers and employees despite my reservations i started doing sex work expecting to hate it but low and behold is has become my most longlasting and consistent work i came into this new project as many organizers do  naive ambitious and with the firm belief that tremendous change was just around the corner after three years on the board and eventually transitioning to the role of inaugural executive director of swopusa i can rest assured its a much longer journey than i had ever anticipated the fight for sex workers rights is complicated and nuanced best practices of the past arent sufficient we are at a crucial moment in the sex workers rights movement our elders fought long and hard for the safety and dignity that we benefit from today but it is not enough we come into another december th with staggering numbers of sex workers who have lost their lives to violence  was a year that we saw brutal violence committed against women of color domestically abroad and at the border everyone knows and loves someone who is a sex worker and those sex workers intersect with and experience every other system of oppression and institution of violence decriminalization as a public health and harm reduction strategy remains an essential pillar of swopusas mission additionally we must address the larger systems that would make decriminalization only a benefit to those already in positions of power criminalization spans much further than sex workers and it impacts us differently black and brown and trans individuals would continue to face extreme policing and violence even if we achieved decriminalization tomorrow our struggle must be intersectional or it is lost this past october the swopusa board of directors and myself participated in the early stages of our strategic planning one of the processes we engaged with was to imagine what december th events could look like in  years it was a struggle for many of us to look so far into the future and try to imagine something brighter more just a world transitioning away from white supremacy and criminalization one of the most tangible points that came out of this conversation was that up until now we have only honored sex workers who have lost their lives we had previously failed to name many other forms of violence violence that is not always immediately fatal  such as incarceration violence resulting from white supremacy trans erasure stigma poverty drug use and so much more this year and for all the years to come we must center the voices and experiences of those impacted by all forms of criminalization we believe that the work of building power and developing activists skills is essential to moving forward as a movement we need a movement of leaders if we want to win and we believe that sex workers will win we could not do this work without our direct community or our generous donors and funders we did not meet our goals for foundation funding for  as unfortunately few foundations directly support our fight and we are in danger of not being able to move forward with some of our funding we need you to you to help keep moving our grassroots organizing forward we currently are running our end of the year fundraising drive in order to continue to support our chapters and projects any contribution tax deductible would be tremendously appreciated and goes directly to funding sex workerled organizing,1

longer see or hear or feel he couldnt be for some reason he was still aware of himself his past and even his personality the only thing he had forgotten was his name it seemed to him that he had never had one but his memories claimed otherwise he had no idea how much time he had spent in that darkness maybe an hour maybe a day a year or perhaps even an eternity it couldve even been a single moment time didnt exist there gradually something began to change and he felt distinctly alive like a newborn he became suddenly aware of his existence he opened his eyes at least he tried to open them his left eyelid was swollen and it wouldnt move but he managed to open his right one with a lot of effort at first everything was blurry but after a while his vision became a little clearer the man saw endless wide skies spread above him was a clean and calm ocean of blue there wasnt a single cloud only a majestic light his hearing came back right after his vision it happened rather abruptly the man heard a stream gurgling somewhere nearby carrying muffled voices next came the sense of smell  the pungent aroma of sewage and feces hung in the air at the same moment he tasted something bitter that reminded him of metal there was blood in his mouth the last to recover was the sense of touch the man finally felt his own body hands legs torso head it all seemed so unusual after his soul had spent some time in the darkness a forgotten feeling he didnt want to move and even if he had tried the pain wouldve impaled him on the spot even lying motionless the man felt his hands burning with pain and blood oozing from the wound on his leg water mixed with blood was touching his skin making it sting and itch his breathing was weak and irregular and his chest hurt the man had no desire to do anything looking at the endless skies with one halfopen eye he reflected he was thinking about why he was here why had life given him another chance what for pain his soul couldnt find peace even after death how sad then his memories started coming back someone elses memories began to merge with his  memories of the previous owner of the body he had found himself in he too had recently died allowing him to be reborn his story was also a tragic one he was only fourteen when he was mutilated killed and thrown into a ditch because of a petty theft he had committed so as not to die of hunger his family had moved to this city not long before that event occurred an epidemic broke out the nature and origins of which remained unknown annihilating almost a tenth of the local population his parents had died a year earlier and left him a small shack and some money he wouldve continued to live on but he was unfortunate enough to have come across a member of one of the citys ruling families broken hands and death were an unjust punishment strange how the man wasnt at all bothered by that right now there was no anger or hatred in him only boundless apathy and a drop of incomprehensible joy the man finally remembered a name it wasnt his however no it belonged to the previous owner but it was still a name his name was kai kai arnhard for some reason he was quite pleased with this suddenly kai was filled with a strange sensation and incomprehensible lines of text showed up before his eyes surprising him life and emotional activity discovered canceling uninstall system restoring the structure resuming work the system has been restored and is ready for use test opening of the options menu to check the mind of the carrier stats age  race human status mortal stage none level none characteristics  power   speed   endurance   stamina   mind   energy  abilities none paths unknown whats this a thought flashed through his shocked mind having regained focus he managed to dig out the memories that might hold answers to his questions as it turned out everyone in this world had such a system kai had no doubts that he was now a part of a completely different world and that he was no longer on earth however he wasnt sure how much martial arts masters like him were worth here the system appeared in people at the moment of their birth and remained there until they died apparently having considered kai dead it began uninstalling itself but the presence of another soul stopped it only one thing remained unclear how and why did he enter the corpse and for what reason had the system started functioning again what had stimulated it the past kai knew little about it as he was from a poor and illiterate family but the new kai who had lived on earth for a long time guessed that it was something like a neural interface  a computer placed in a persons brain that millions of people from his world could only dream about the little knowledge that the past kai did have he had gained from the general information window of the system and rumors that he had heard from his parents as the present kai understood it the system scanned the characteristics of the body at birth and displayed them in the brain in the form of numbers it performed the same action whenever any stat changed the system was constantly monitoring them they were calculated in relation to the average value of the physical abilities of a twentyyearold human with a score of one being equivalent to that value kais stats were extremely low right now even for his age the reason behind it was his crippled and beatenup body present kai reread the information window not wanting to rely only on past kais memories power was responsible for all manifestations of physical strength and speed for the speed of muscle contraction transmission of neural signals throughout the body and even thinking endurance was selfexplanatory and the system information only confirmed the present kais assumptions the next characteristic  stamina  determined ones resistance to various injuries and the ability to recover from them that is to regenerate weirdly though the mind which by logic shouldve been pretty low  he had never considered himself smart  was almost doubled mind reflected all intellectual and mental abilities kai assumed that this characteristic had such a high value due to social reasons since there were no official educational institutions in this world there werent as many literate people here as there were on earth therefore in comparison to the local majority he was highly developed in this regard despite being in the body of a fourteenyearold boy at least he wasnt a complete loser the last characteristic displayed the amount of energy that could be used to perform various techniques in this world techniques were special abilities that allowed a person to use magic called martial arts it could be said that in this case the word technique was a synonym for the word spell kai suddenly felt weak he shouldnt have survived but since he had he shouldnt have remained conscious the mysterious force that remained with him after his soul had moved into the new body kept him alert only for ten minutes consciousness was slipping away from him and kai found himself floating in the darkness once more  in the meantime in one of the alleys where people were rarely seen about  feet away from a wounded man stood two figures a pretty girl of about eighteen was marching down the alley her thick brown hair was pulled back into a tight ponytail and her warm amber eyes were sparkling despite her graceful form her dress was rather plain she was holding the wrinkled hand of a grayhaired old man in spite of his age he kept his back straight and didnt lag behind his granddaughter time seemed to have had no power over him dressed in a long robe that only healers were allowed to wear he calmly walked forward grandpa i swear the girl said with concern you have to see it the resemblance is uncanny so what he asked in a deep voice you must understand julie that the past cant be changed i beg you just take a look she cried the old man only sighed after a couple of minutes they reached the illfated alley with a gutter what the old man saw made him freeze bitter sorrow filled his heart right there among the garbage and sewage lay a boy who was the spitting image of a person close to him of his grandson a grandson who had disappeared more than a year ago it cant be the old man whispered not believing his eyes i told you julie said unable to hold back tears could it be that he managed to return the old man was silent it was difficult for him a wise old man to believe in miracles the old man was silent it was difficult for him a wise old man to believe in miracles thats the old man fell silent having gotten closer julie was finally able to examine the boy her heart sank when she saw his wounds and broken hands sobbing she fell to her knees grandpa julie had no doubt that this was her younger brother she refused to believe that the heavens couldnt hear her and that she wouldnt be rewarded for months of suffering she wanted to believe that her missing brother had been saved having noticed the change in his granddaughter the old man quickly leaned forward and assessed the boys injuries a doctors temperament as well as the hope that this truly was his grandson didnt allow him to just stand by idly and watch grab his shoulders careful he began to instruct julie we need to get him to our clinic as soon as possible i dont know who has done this to him but if we dont act quickly he wont survive julie who had been helping her grandfather all her life quickly did as she was told with no hesitation she grabbed the boy under the armpits as carefully as possible the old man took the boys legs and they lifted him together having quickly and carefully brought him to the clinic which was a part of their house they laid him on the bed removing and throwing away his dirty clothes having washed the boy the old man began treating him check out this novel on amazon httpwwwamazoncomdpbscs,1

"choose prahova
prahova tourism needs our help and we need holidays and relaxation safe close to home
that is why today we had an important meeting with the representatives of the tourism industry in prahova one of the most affected sectors of activity in our county since the beginning of the coronavirus epidemic
the discussions with the representatives of the economic agents in the profile coming from several areas of our county but also with the local authorities and last but not least with the prahova chamber of commerce and industry highlighted the lack of clear measures from the government romania for the reopening of this sector severely affected by the establishment of states of emergency and alert
i perceived the voices of the economic operators who participated in today is meeting as cries for help because the jobs of over  employees in prahova tourism will be in danger if no concrete solutions are found and as soon as possible
although it announced the reopening of tourism activities the pnl government has not yet come up with a clear plan for the horeca industry or specific economic measures to support this sector representatives of prahova tourism fear for the future of companies and their employees and expect a mouthful of oxygen from the government
we can help them locally one of the viable proposals made today by economic agents a proposal they support is to cancel the payment of taxes on buildings and land for tourism companies to cover the period related to the state of emergency and the state of alert
the promotion of prahova tourism is also a necessary objective to be fulfilled there are extraordinary areas in our county apart from the wellknown prahova valley teleajen valley and slanic valley and it is our duty to bring them to the attention of all romanians because prahova has a history that deserves to be known in the smallest details
together with the prahova chamber of commerce and industry the prahova association for the promotion and development of tourism the tourism operators and the local authorities we will structure a new promotion strategy for our county to which i invite you to contribute
i would also like to thank all the participants in today is discussions a first step in the direction of saving tourism one of the representative industries of prahova

"we have become a human chain so that no one is left on the sidelines
denise coordinates public health centers
nicosia cyprus
the ministry of health of cyprus immediately took effective measures to address the pandemic of covid public health centers have been set up in all cities for the clinical examination and control of those who show symptoms of the disease as well as for the sampling of close contacts of confirmed cases and for the monitoring of confirmed cases these centers also conducted a nationwide survey to assess the extent of the virus spreading to the community
according to deniz alexandrou coordinator of the public health centers our feelings are unprecedented signs of physical fatigue are evident nobody counts the endless working hours we do not have time to think about such a thing there is no alternative we understand that this is a lifeanddeath struggle and we want to guarantee that this invisible enemy will not separate us from our loved ones
the success of the whole effort is based on the leadership of the ministry of health the doctors and nurses who are on the front line and the epidemiological surveillance and control unit of infectious diseases but there are still many who play an important role in the effort volunteer teachers in public health centers who work with all those referred to them by hospitals the ambulance service the it specialists of the university of cyprus and the officials of various ministries and other organizations
we will continue together for as long as it takes says denise participation in this rare human chain has only one goal to emerge victorious with as few victims as possible people are not numbers when all this is over we do not want anyone to be left out

running ads of a political nature in america right now lets you see the pain and frustration people are feeling the comments we read are filled with emotions from hope to all out rage it is easy to understand why for over a decade we have had a power struggle between congress and the white house and emotions have been reaching a boiling point for some time now metaphorically were in a big relationship fight weve escalated to the point of if you dont agree with me then  im out of here it seems like were in that point of the fight where were so dug in that were ready to break up or get divorced now ask ourselves these questions what will happen if we do not resolve this fight what if it did lead to divided nations do you really think america would be better off if we broke up do you think that we would have the same military might if we were smaller separate economies if our adversaries wanted to destroy us what would we do if we were attacked while were in the middle of fighting with ourselves what would we do if we were attacked after becoming bitterly separated nations would we realistically form some coalition like the european union after just declaring that we hate each other so much that we separated we would certainly be more vulnerable and would lose the strength we have today in the world is that the outcome we really want for those who dont think dividing ourselves further is the right directionhow can we start to come back together without compromising on our beliefs there is certainly plenty of blame to go around and we know many people will focus on that in the comments but in our personal lives has anyone ever resolved a bitter fight by forcing the other person to give up their beliefs has anyone ever resolved a fight by reinforcing that its the other persons fault resolving a fight starts with small steps that usually dont focus on the things that caused the fight lets be honest were not going to start by coming together on the hot button issues our nerves are too raw right now and it is understandable because there really are some issues where we have strong differences of opinion its hard for us to see right now how wed work together without compromising on our own sense of right and wrong so let us not start there instead there are some issues where were not so different if we start working together on those issues we can start to cut the tension and division we feel and just like in the moments after we resolve a fight we could start to see the other person as a someone we care about again even if we cannot imagine that right now at that time we might be in a better emotional state to find solutions we can agree on for today is hot button issues that do not require us to compromise on our values if we the people are encouraging our elected officials to fight with each other then that is exactly what they are going to do but if we the people are united in our support of what we want no one would stay in office long without getting in line over  conservative moderate and liberal americans have already committed to working together on the issues where we agreeand we are growing we are going to voice our support together on those issues to our representatives in washington check out our site to learn more about how we are doing it,1

stephen j mccarthy after returning from lincoln nh after labor day weekend september  called patrics mother and said the mccarthy family are planning to go danny smiths condo to celebrate patrics th birthday which would be the columbus day weekend the th of october  deanne is not in favor of this that weekend of patrics birthday is columbus day weekend which she is to have patric per the custody agreement you can bet margaret mccarthy was aware of this   stephen mccarthy continues to push and deanne agrees but only after stephen j mccarthy agrees to never let patric alone with gabe and noah do to gabes verbal physical and recent sexual advances on patric in may  stephen j mccarthy also convinced deanne not report the abuse to the bourne police so patrics th birthday was held with his mother and friends the weekend prior to his leaving for new hampshire at our house with cake ice cream games fight with silly string with some of his friends from the neighborhood he received his bourne hockey jacket and other gifts at the party stephen j mccarthys plea to for her to deanne change her weekend was for patrics birthday in new hampshire mysteriously there was nothing planed for patrics th birthday in new hampshire there is not one eye witness that ever saw patric wearing a white fleece bomber jacket ball cap or playing with his game boy all of which stephen states he was given for his birthday while in new hampshire and tells the nhsp that he was wearing these items when he disappeared not one eye witness describes patric wearing and white fleece bomber jacket ball cap or having his game boy with him on monday it would be out of place to be wearing a white fleece bomber jacket in  degree temperatures on  october  we have asked stephen j mccarthy if we could view the pictures he took of patric while in new hampshire no pictures of any cake no pictures of any white fleece bomber jacket by the way monday  october  the temperature was  degrees and the gifts he described patric had received there are no pictures of patric that weekend in new hampshire except the one of patric covered with a tarp it defies logic that someone would die of hypothermia without shedding his clothes nearby before they would curl up in the fetal position go to sleep and die none of what you just read is also ever investigated we do know that many items that were in the ford suv were transferred to another vehicle and returned to bourne ma by nickie rouix and tracy langley at the request of margaret mccarthy on the  october  i believe some of those packages contained patrics missing articlesclothing and all of his toys that were in his back pack i also believe stephen mccarthy knew this also we also know that mccarthy family member margaret mccarthy donated patrics back pack that contained all his toys that he brought to new hampshire this is also documented the backpack was completely empty when she donated it and when discovered by the salvation army the backpack contained his name address and phone number the salvation army brought the backpack to the nhsp at the command center that also is documented it defies all logic that not one item of patrics was ever found in new hampshire no coat no hat no gameboy no toys the only toy that is accounted for is the toy gabe and noah stole from his backpack on monday and thought it would be funny to rip it apart and throw it into clearbrook that also is known to the nhsp on wednesday  october  never investigated all evidence clearly points to the mccarthy family knowing on monday that patric was never coming home again scarinza interview cape code times   scarinza said he made the decision to bring patric down after consulting with fish and game wardens who routinely handle searchandrescue efforts nhsp lt scarinza makes this asinine statement that defies all common sense lt scarinza fish and game wardens routinely handle unattended deaths of minor children the nhsp and the medical examiners office are not involved in securing the crime scene or handling the unattended death nhsp no investigation is necessary no medical examiner is required for unattended deaths nhsp must not be qualified to investigate unattended deaths and solely rely on game wardens when it comes to unattended deaths lt john scarinza has got to be the most arrogant untrained state police officer in new hampshire i believe based on his comment is one reason sgt charles m west and lt scarinza were assigned to f troop the new hampshire law enforcement and new hampshire fish amp game knew from the beginning that they were searching for patric on federal property ahj agency having jurisdiction when patric mccarthys body was found on federal property the fbi was present on scene they are the agency having jurisdiction that should have been obvious to all once patrics body was found that would have prompted fbi as the lead agency to investigate patrics mysterious disappearance from the onset why did the fbi agents turn a blind eye and never take control to this day why has the fbi backed off this murder case i will begin to go through and post their investigative reports and post comments that were written as notes but when transcribed were left out of the official investigative report keep in mind some very heavily redacted,1

dust storms or haboobs are more common during the early part of the monsoon but can occur at any time during the season depending on rainfall patterns be prepared for blowing dust and reduced visibilities any time thunderstorms are nearby
remember pull aside stay alive
if you encounter a dust storm and cannot avoid driving into it
pull off the road as far as you can safely do so
turn off your headlights and taillights
put your vehicle in park andor engage your parking brake and take your foot off the brake so your brake lights are not illuminated other motorists may tend to follow tail lights in an attempt to get through the dust storm and may strike your vehicle from behind
dust storms usually last a few minutes and up to an hour at most stay where you are until the dust storm passes",1

"the zero to defend
this morning the daily update of the gores gave the best possible news for all of us from the marche region
zero new infections from covid in the last  hours
that is something that has never happened since  february when the epidemic touched our region
it is over maybe
in the coming days we will still have some positive cases caution remains necessary
but it is certainly the first zero of a long series as is also happening with the number of deaths
net of the many prophets of doom the improvement is clear and irrefutable
many predicted a new boom in patients after may  even more those who saw italy again in the abyss after reopening on may 
fortunately the numbers are telling another story
that zero tells us not to let our guard down but it also encourages us to live go out go back to sharing moments with others
carefully of course but also leaving fear at home
but it is also a zero to defend
today for example i listened to the words of the mayor of milan beppe sala angry at some southern regions who hypothesized to request a sort of certificate of negativity to the virus as a condition for welcoming tourists from areas where the contagion is still high
when i decide where to go on vacation i will remember it said the milanese mayor
but then we havent learned anything
do we remind you of the accusations of racism against those who at the beginning of this tragedy asked for the blocking of arrivals from china
containing this pandemic reducing the number of infections was difficult painful required sacrifices devastated the economy
nobody wants to ghettoize the lombards or anyone else
but we cannot even pretend that we are all in the same conditions if in a single region there are two thirds of the infections in all of italy

"i support grady county gaining nd amendment sanctuary status there are bills introduced into the georgia legislature frequently that try to infringe upon your right to bear arms some go as far to include semiautomatic guns which would include many sporting shotguns
yes it is true that state law would supersede any local ordinance or law so some might ask then if the state passed a gun law and it would supersede any local ordinance or resolution then why become nd amendment sanctuary it sends a symbolic message to atlanta that grady county will not enforce any new gun law that infringes on our nd amendment rights
additionally when our law makers in atlanta sit down and think about that new gun law banning semiautomatics magazines of  rounds banning certain firearm platforms or other additional new gun restrictions they will have in their minds we have all these nd amendment sanctuary counties passing new gun law does little good if these counties are refusing to enforce
more importantly it is having our voices heard it is about sending a message that we will not support more gun laws it is about expressing our desire to keep as it stands our constitutional right to bear arms
i personally appeared before the broad of commissioners at the feb th meeting and presented a formal resolution declaring grady county a nd amendment sanctuary county honestly my guess was this would have zero problems becoming a county resolution our board is comprised of a majority of nd amendment supporters right our board certainly would discuss and possibility get feedback from their constituents right our board would vote on it and move forward right wrong upon discussion prior to the meeting with chairman moye he expressed the concern about the possibility of losing state funding should grady county sign the resolution in that regard he would not bring the resolution up for discussion or vote but rather table it   
so we are going to accept an infringement on our nd amendment right we have that gets restricted in a new state law over some state funding sorry folks i cant reason with that and i dont believe any resolution we pass here will change how we transact with atlanta we will always have a cordial working relationship with the good folks up north and it is not a bad thing for them to hear their constituent is voice here in grady county
in closing the number of georgia counties that have nd amendment sanctuary resolutions in place at the moment is  that is  of georgia counties folks i can tell you that number would be much higher had not covid slowed the momentum i can also tell you that once things settle down in this pandemic this number will increase and with your help grady county will be

"siegfried muresan pnl mep and ppe vicepresident the european parliament is working committee will debate the situation of seasonal workers in europe today it is a very important topic for us because romania is one of the countries where most seasonal workers in europe come from
what will this debate be about and what is our aim the european parliament
first of all we want to make sure that workers rights are respected in all corners of europe we want to respect the freedom of movement of citizens the freedom to work but also to ensure good working conditions workers to have access to social and health services and to prevent measures in the context of the covid pandemic
therefore we expect the host countries which receive seasonal workers to ensure that these conditions are met
governments in their home countries have taken steps to protect their citizens but once our citizens arrive in the countries where they want to work we expect the governments of these countries to ensure that employers respect the rights of employees
i will keep you informed of the conclusions of the debate",1

"do you know the most common thread between millionaires
they invest
not in the stock market
not in ecommerce
not in franchises

real estate is the most timetested income strategy in the world but the thing is that before a few years ago
only the wealthy had access to the best real estate deals
these days technology has completely leveled the playing field for anyone to get started with  down
with the same time and effort it takes to buy and flip junk at a garage sale
you could be flipping houses and making way more
most people think you need to use your own money to flip homes
you dont
ive flipped  properties without using my own cash
the best thing about getting started in real estate today
 you dont have to risk any of your own money
 you dont need a real estate license
 there is no need to rehab or repair the home
if youve ever bought and sold something before
you could do this i created a video where i show you stepbystep how this is done
check it out here
see you there
cody sperber
aka the clever investor
ps im getting a lot of direct messages saying something similar to the following
if youre so successful in real estatewhy do you teach others shouldnt you focus on flipping more houses
it is a valid question these days it is so easy to say youre a real estate expert on the internet
a few reasons
 my first love was teaching i wanted to be a high school history teacher
 i truly believe the world is a better place with more real estate investorswith more people working for themselves and following their dreams ive been fortunate to help many people successfully follow in my footsteps

it is with incredible sadness and devastated hearts that hab has to report another bear missing a limb this poor bear looks to be in very dire need of help the new total of bears missing limbs reported to hab is now  the photos of this amazing and precious bear were captured by becca lynn of rebecca perry photography while at a park in northeastern north carolina we thank this amazing and caring follower who wants to see what did this stopped and these bears he  lped for taking the time to document this amazing bear this bear needs urgent help if everyone had the heart of becca we would not be seeing these images thankfully there are enough people with caring hearts like you and her to fight for these now  bears missing limbs against this great evil that befell them for the purpose of harvesting their parts to sell hab is working very hard on establishing a bear rehabilitation and sanctuary near asheville nc to help bears like this bear and any bears that need helpeven if it means giving them longterm care for the remainder of their life their life has already been a sad struggle because of evil people who trap them for their parts the ones that get away before being killed by the trapper are left with a lifetime of suffering like this amazing bear as the  confirmed bears missing limbs get older a new suffering will come when the other limb front or back depending on which limb is missing with the pressure of the bears weight gives out and the bears will walk on their elbows or hind legs or drag themselves like in cases hab has researched in asia and posted previously there must be a sanctuary for this bear and any injured bears or bears missing limbs to help them as they get older hab realizes many are mothers currently with cubs or newly weaned cubs and we dont want to take having babies away from these amazing mothers however we want to help them as they get older and their struggle becomes harder the only time a bear should be tranquilized is to get the bear help hab also knows that these bears are easy targets for hunters who see them limp around the hab page has been flooded by cowards who want to kill and eat the threelegged bears these trappers are mad we gained ground in our fight against amazon their prime cheap source for instruments of suffering and cruelty therefore they attacked hab over the past week threatening to kill and cook the bears missing limbs to alleviate the bears suffering caused by other lazy trappers the only things that are going to be eliminated are these traps and the losers that use them to hurt these bears when they are sitting in jail for animal cruelty tomorrow hab will be posting more about a mission we must achieve and not give up on before hunting season we must save the bears missing limbs from people who want them to go away including the third ncwrc investigator assigned as lead investigator for the bears who said in the interview with the informant and members that he thought there were too many bears in general they never cared and still dont care about these bears or bears in general colonel morgan warned members of this but we did not heed this warning not to trust ncwrc hab made the mistake of trusting ncwrc to do whats right after all the wrong they had done from the beginning of our movement to help these bears because the governor would not respond to this crisis and assign the sbi only he has the authority to assign the sbi to investigate what happened to the bears and ncwrcs reactions ncwrc is an agency full of trappers and hunters who believe in managing wildlife by killing ncwrc killed one bear who was missing a limb  years ago for being too friendly hab members believe that if ncwrc or these hunters threatening the bears are not stopped these people will do anything to make the efforts of hab and the people that want to help the bears vanish because many of them are trappers themselves and therefore support the cruel practice hab will demand that the governor who has not even reacted to this historic tragedy and all state officials immediately place a felony ban on killing a bear missing a limb in nc these bears have suffered enough because of trappers who did this to them and the trappers within ncwrc who did nothing to help them or stop the poachers bears missing limbs do become friendly and they need our help thankfully they have people who have helped them and  friends and growing who are followers of hab that will make sure they are helped and not further harmed your love and passion for these bears has done so much good already you can save these bears and stop this hab will join you and spend all the private money we can necessary to make sure all of these things happen for the bears quickly these pictures make us cry and the reactions of those paid by taxpayers to protect and conserve them makes us sick and angry watching bears and wildlife is our life and passion this has been the most heartbreaking experience for us as well as you together we are going to channel all of our heartbreak and emotions to stop these traps protect these bears expose all the poachers we can and create the rehabilitation and sanctuary that these amazing bears deserve and need hab never wanted your money and never will we want your fight and heart for these bears and all animals to stop foot hold traps forever and to hunt down people who hurt animals your money is needed in rehabilitations and sanctuaries here and around the world where they save animals the people who operate and work at these facilities are heroes who need your support hab is privately funded and support for this cause is quickly growing hab will never stop until we have achieved these goals for the bears and animals that give us so much joy and never hurt us please today tell anyone you can that there are  bears in the blue ridgesmoky mountains missing limbs from trap escapes and  new confirmation in eastern nc bring the total to  ask them all to follow this page to make these bears voice so loud that the whole world knows their tragedy share to any media and celebrities you can and ask them to share to the world what has happened in and near nc it has never happened anywhere in the world where there are this many bears or any animals missing limbs it is past time for the governor do his job and help these bears mr bezos your unbound approach to business had a real world impact on wildlife here and around the world the wet markets supplied by the trappers and poachers you sell to have also created an effect on humans worldwide with the viruses that can come from the markets you are a very rich man who made one of the poorest decisions in history you will soon be known worldwide for the devastation left by being the prime trap supplier in the world for over a decade hurting animals brings really bad karma mr bezos and you must face these pictures of injuries and injured animals caused by the traps and supplies you profited from for so long hab will not let you hide from this cruelty you tried to be a silent accomplice to  please like and follow hab email amazon share the reward and sign

good news the national trust for canada has announced this morning that the minchau blacksmith shop in old strathcona has officially made it onto the top  endangered places list in canada this will bring much needed attention to its historical relevance and to a wider public and political platform but much work is still needed to save the minchau blacksmith shop as it still does not have an official registered designation bad news the minchau blacksmith shop has made  it onto the top  endangered places list in canada its fate is hanging in the balance right now as are so many historical buildings across canada the fact that it has gotten this far and so close to possible demolition is loudly indicative of the rights of developers everywhere and the acquiescence of our governments note that weak legislation and inadequate financial incentives in alberta are a main threat to historic structural buildings giving developers far too much reach fortunately there is a groundswell movement happening right now which is being felt and recognized as we spread the word farther to stop the demolition of our historical buildings and more people become aware and write letters to our municipal and provincial governments and federal it gets more difficult for the government elect to ignore the issue at hand and the people who voted them into office we can only hope that some developers have a similar sense of community and will also step up to the plate and help preserve our historical heritage buildings please join us and please continue to write the provincial government who has the power to designate the minchau blacksmith shop an official historic heritage site and the municipal government at city hall who can take a bigger stand in dialogue with the developer and aid in stopping the demolition share our page with friends and family like our page to receive ongoing posts encourage others to send an email to government and write again and again if you want our numbers need to go up please see below for email address to send letters to ironically blacksmiths were the cornerstone of growth and development for their communities in every part of the world and throughout history in our short canadian farming and industrial history blacksmiths were the critical component in advancing our country and our society to an equivalent status as that of europe and other countries particularly in the early part of the twentieth century homes buildings vehicles and industrial equipment were no longer held together by tongue and groove boarding and wooden pegs homes and buildings incorporated nails and other metal and steel implements in their construction and became more solid wagons gave way to carriages and then automobiles the walking plow gave way to better farm tools equipment and tractors and all because of a blacksmith is knowledge of metals forging and welding and his required skills we all share in the benefits of modernization and we all share in the history that precedes it this should not be so difficult for our governments to recognize the value of the two that they can in fact coexist together side by side each with their own intrinsic beauty and thoughtfully forged together with the precision like that of a blacksmith to build a bigger better stronger and healthier society we as a nation recognize our historical buildings as important to the value of our heritage we as a nation and as edmontonians and albertans recognize our heritage as important to the value of being a canadian citizen if developers and our governments continue to neglect and demolish our historical buildings there will be no heritage left there will be no tangible connection to our past to developers and our elected government body of officials we are not against the fair and reasonable development of new buildings or new ideas we all share in the benefits of modernization but we stand against the demolition of our historical buildings please designate the minchau blacksmith shop an official registered historical heritage site and stop the demolition we thank the national trust for canada in recognizing the historical and heritage value of the a minchau blacksmith shop in the historical and cultural district of old strathcona and for placing it on the top  endangered places list in canada we know our work is not done and we value our relationship with your people in ottawa if you are new to our page take a moment to read through the previously written posts and please take a moment to send an email to the provincial government and to city hall help us to stop the demolition of the a minchau blacksmith shop in old strathcona and to have it designated a historical heritage site via the provincial government please send emails to culturetourismministergovabca ricardo miranda  minister of culture and tourism premiergovabca premier rachel notley in subject header write designate the minchau blacksmith shop official heritage status cityclerkedmontonca edmonton city council includes mayor don iveson in subject header write forward to city council  halt the demolition of the minchau blacksmith shop when writing to the province or to city hall use as many or as few words as you would like indicating your opposition to demolition and why you believe this  year old historic building should be designated an official registered historical heritage site please help us stop the demolition of the minchau blacksmith shop,1

fear emotion of segregation
it may be but fear is also the emotion of thoughtfulness caution and group fighting on behalf of a true enemy
together we are stronger but this together needs to be together we must empathize with our role as we retreat to our homes together is not visiting your grandparents together is isolating your children from living with their friends together it is taking care of every situation that poses a risk to the other it is sneezing covering your face it is entering each place and before anything wash your hands together is keeping distance
for the first time together it is separate
to use the emotion of fear is to see all the risks involved in this circumstance and to be careful with each place we touch to sanitize every evil thought about the other to wash away any prejudice we have with the different and together to be more equal in favor of a common good
together you there and us here but together in the certainty that for the first time we will take care of each other separately
we are together stayhome together",1

an advertisement paid for by my political action committee on the topic of female genital mutilationcutting fgmc has evoked strong reactions from the local community like many mainers i was horrified to learn that maine has hundreds of little girls at risk of this cultural practice along with many democrats i supported bipartisan legislation that would have helped maine prohibit this form of child abuse to help send a strong message of solidarity with other states  and the global community to end fgm just a few months ago new hampshire became the th state to criminalize female genital mutilation with unanimous support many organizations including unicef the aha foundation and the world health organization support eliminating fgm the united nations also calls for zero tolerance of fgmc while there is a federal law that prohibits cutting there are loop holes that leave thousands of girls across the country at risk and it forces a crime committed against a maine citizen to rely on federal prosecution that is why the maine prosecutors association testified  the eight elected da s make up the executive directors of the maine prosecutors association we are democrats and republicans and we are in support of ld  the prosecutors do not feel confident that they can charge someone with committing female genital mutilation without the passage of this bill why there are two main reasons  while female genital mutilation is a barbaric disfiguration bearing no resemblance to male circumcision there are prosecutors that argue that it is not aggravated assault when the parents and children consent the prosecutors would like clear guidance from this committee as to whether or not you want this mutilation charged as a crime clear statues without guess work are important if you want state prosecutions yes it is already illegal federally but the da offices try by far the most criminal cases in maine  the law court held in state v kargar  ad  me  that a picture of a man with his sons penis in his mouth did not constitute sexual assault there is a debate among prosecutors as to whether a similar analysis could be used by the law court to overturn a female genital mutilation assault conviction again clarity from this committee would be extremely helpful there is speculation on whether the crime is happening in maine or not here is what we know  maine is one of only  states in the country to receive a special federal grant targeting fgmc year  medicaid mainecare billing receipts show fgm has been treated every year since   maine access immigrant networkmain the recipient of the federal grant has issued a report stating sixteen percent of providers most from portland and lewiston reported that between  and  of the patients they saw in the last year had experienced fgmc  the population reference bureau has identified  females at high risk in maine   other states have criminalized fgmc antfgm legislation is about protecting young girls with a clear law that serves as a deterrent and if a crime occurs as justice for the victim fgm is a cultural issue and not a racial or religious issue it is practiced by people of many faiths and it predates islam by centuries as a state representative i placed the ad to highlight attention to this issue on behalf of frustrated constituents as the result of submitted letters that have been stymied or repeatedly denied publication after  days of review this paper accepted the ad and they willingly accepted payment interestingly the papers editor wrote a biased rebuttal in the same edition of the paper thus proving knowledge in advance courier publications seems to be holding a personal grudge because of my interview policy after repeatedly being misquoted and grossly misrepresented i am now happy to answer questions in writing purposefully fomenting community anger should never be a goal of any newspaper the purpose of the ad was to bring awareness to this horrid crime and to inform the voters that maine house democrats views on this issue put party politics before protecting vulnerable girls and they are not in alignment with the maine senate other democrats other states the global community the governor the us congress the list goes on i have succeeded to be clear democrat senator dave miramant voted in favor of this bill and that sarah gideon democrat speaker of the house was an original sponsor of the antifgm bill the question people should ask is why would speaker gideon change course and lead the house democrats to oppose legislation that is passed with unanimous support from the maine senate and so many other states i suspect this conversation will be ongoing and my sincere hope is that we will be able to pass meaningful antifgm

im back out of fakebook jail and im going to start back by trying to get put back into fakebook jail with my very first real post since getting suspended a week ago fakebook is actively working against our country and those who have those who do and those who are willing to fight for their freedoms to get filthy rich while highjacking the first amendment ill explain their timing is so conspicuous that there is little room for doubt on october the th i posted a vic  tory for those fighting for our freedoms when i was sent and posted a photo of a dead terrorist it was not a gory photo it was obviously the photo that was used to identity and close the case file of a man that would love nothing more than to have the heads of every single employee at fakebook he was cleaned up there was no blood it was the head shot of a sleeping terrorist with a small brown spot on his forehead that appeared to be the entrance wound left by the bullet that he so very much deserved there were far more and many thousands if not millions of more offensive and gory photos posted of people is halloween costumes just a couple days prior to when they banned me from using fakebook on november the th the timing is conspicuous because fakebook and matt zuckherburger is minions banned me at just about the same time last year and for something else so small and ridiculous that it is impossible to think this is an accident or a coincidence they are doing this to me on purpose why do they ban me just a few days before the biggest event that i host every year the freedom fighters open that directly benefits the families of the people that put such bullets in such terrorists foreheads the freedom fighters open is always the friday before veterans day and fakebook knows it iwe spend hundreds of dollars on fakebook every year to promote the main effort of vfw post  operation santa it is more than apparent that they do not care about our money they do not care that we want to propagate the values that have made this society the most successful ever devised by mankind they do not care because they want impede it they want to mitigate our success because our success mitigates that of the socialists and communists in our country had we posted something about political correctness or socialistcommunist values these people would be putting right in the middle of everybody is timelines i pray often that somebody comes up with a similar medium that will collapse this one and put mike zuckherburg in the soup line where he belongs but where else can we get a message to several thousand like minded people in this day and age we cannot because we cannot im am  behind any politician or group of politicians that want to regulate this utility just as they regulate every other utility i know the road to hell is paved by the good intentions of politicians but their good intentions have to be better than the bad intentions of fakebook ill see you all on the other side of my next ban rangers lead the way,1

"breaking covid relief story  individuals fed in south africa
this is a story worth celebrating but many of our team left feeling even more burdened by the tremendous need with regard to the people affected by the shutdowns nikki our team member in south africa said the majority are more concerned about getting something to eat than a virus that seems very far away
the food distributed in this project was epap an instant porridge made from wholegrain maize and soybeans that contains all the essential nutrients vitamins and energy required for a day the team chose epap because it is nutritious and will enable people to survive extreme hunger during the lockdown plus it does not require any cooking it only needs either cold or warm water to be added to it
most importantly epap is extremely costeffective for only  usd we can buy enough porridge to feed one person for  days this helps us to do much with little and maximize our impact it meant that we got to find the very least of thesethose who might not survive without helpand ensure that they have just enough nutrition to make it through the lockdown period
i hope we can continue to give so much more to so many who need it most when i saw tears falling from their eyes out of gratitude for the food given to them i was deeply humbled said michelle a member of our south africa team like all of lji she is anxious to do more you can enable this relief work by giving today at the link in bio covid hungerrelief

a year ago talking about expanding rent control on a statewide level and repealing costa hawkins was a pipe dream yesterday nearly  million voters showed up in support of prop  to repeal costa hawkins it took nearly  million dollars of deceptive misleading campaign lies from corporate landlords to prevent tenants from expanding rent control but this was just round one for us while the housing crisis is only getting worse our movement is getting bigger and stronger and we have got momentum on our side join us immediately in calling on governorelect gavin newsom to enact a statewide rent freeze and work with us to pass strong statewide renter protections while wall street landlords outspent us nearly  to   momentum for rent control actually keeps growing poll after poll has shown that a majority of california voters support it thats why the oppositions deceptive ads barely mentioned rent control they needed to rely on lies and deception to win they are scared  and they should be this is just the beginning we built an incredible coalition of thousands of renters landlords homeowners and community members across the state who brought widespread attention to the damaging effects of the housing crisis in california we secured the endorsements of the california democratic party the aclu the league of women voters the california teachers association the california nurses association and hundreds of other organizations who we can now count as allies in the housing justice movement we were able to create new academic research and support to push back on some of the corporate landlord lies this will be helpful in upcoming fights for each of you that volunteered with prop  thank you thank you thank you thank you for your tireless work weekend after weekend for dealing with the late nights the stale pizza the countless phone calls your work was not in vain every volunteer we recruited and every voter we moved makes our movement that much stronger and more powerful we shall not be moved,1

making a case for joe biden more than just that he polls well against donald trump and let us start off by saying that those polls should not be ignored joe biden has had a consistent edge over the other democratic candidates in headtohead polling against trump in national surveys going back to last march biden kicks trump is butt additionally biden polls much better against trump than other candidates in swing states but right now let us focus on some things that biden brings to the table in terms of the sheer number of issues biden influenced during his time in the obama administration foreign policy and fiscal issues are among many items in biden is portfolio back in  it was biden is office that primarily orchestrated the handover of iraq to the iraqis it is biden is view of afghanistan that bit by bit came to dominate thinking inside the  withdrawal plan on financial reform it was biden who prodded an indecisive obama to embrace paul volcker is idea of barring banks from risky trading according to austan goolsbee formerly the head of obama is council of economic advisers biden also tilted the discussion in favor of a bailout of the big three auto companies according to jared bernstein biden is former economic adviser i think he made a difference in president is thinking bernstein said he understood the importance of the auto companies to their communities and throughout the country thanks to his decades in the senate biden came to the job of vp with a deep understanding of the way the federal government operates which enabled him to oversee projects that spanned different agencies and different branches most importantly he was in charge of implementing the american recovery and reinvestment act recovery act which was one of the administrations great unsung successes it involved a huge amount of work and coordination and by every account biden performed exceptionally well at it just the fact that they managed to distribute over threequarters of a trillion dollars without any major scandals of graft or theft was an extraordinary accomplishment biden led the successful administration effort to gain senate approval for the new start treaty strategic arms reduction treaty this is a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the united states and the russian federation with the formal name of measures for the further reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms it was signed on april th  in prague and after ratification entered into force on february th  it is expected to last at least until  biden declared his support for marriage equality on national television in   three days before barack obama did hes been a champion of lgbtq rights and made big waves when he said its going to become a political liability in the near term for an individual to say i oppose gay marriage mark my words in a  interview with the human rights campaigns chad griffin his support for the lgbtq community continued throughout his vice presidency biden officiated a samesex wedding at the vice presidential residence in washington dc marrying two longtime white house staffers buzzfeed reported at the  state of the union address obama announced the establishment of cancer moonshot an initiative led by biden that would accelerate cancer research making more therapies available to more patients while improving our ability to prevent cancer and detect it in early stages according to the national cancer institute moonshot came almost a year after bidens son beau died of brain cancer in may of  at age  biden is  violence against women act was reauthorized in   and  the act led to further related developments in the creation of the white house council on women and girls begun in obama is first term as well as the white house task force to protect students from sexual assault begun in january  with biden as cochair along with valerie jarrett biden has a strong stance on sexual assault for example biden stated to a victim of sexual assault at stanford university you did it  in the hope that your strength might prevent this crime from happening to someone else your bravery is breathtaking he has also taken legality into the situation biden issued federal guidelines while presenting a speech at the university of new hampshire he stated that no means no if you are drunk or you are sober no means no if you are in bed in a dorm or on the street no means no even if you said yes at first and you changed your mind no means no biden was selected to head up a special task force on the issue of gun control after a school shooting at a newtown connecticut elementary school biden delivered solutions for reducing gun violence across the nation to president obama in january  he helped craft  actions that the president could take on the issue using his power of executive order among other recommendations among  presidential candidates biden has the longest legislative record on climate change he pioneered some of the earliest climate change legislation in us history his first climate change bill introduced in  did not pass in the senate but the following year a version of bidens legislation survived as an amendment to a state department funding bill president ronald reagan went on to sign it into law the upshot of bidens global climate protection act was to call on the president to set up a task force to plan how to mitigate global warming the measure also asked him to make climate change a higher priority item on the ussoviet agenda biden supports governmental funding to find new energy sources he cosponsored the sense of the senate resolution calling on the united states to be a part of the united nations climate negotiations and the boxersanders global warming pollution reduction act the most stringent climate bill in the united states senate under obama the recovery act implemented by biden made the largest single investment in clean energy in history providing more than  billion in strategic clean energy investments and tax incentives to promote job creation and the deployment of lowcarbon technologies and leveraging approximately  billion in private and other nonfederal capital for clean energy investments joe is skilled at reaching across the aisle to get things done he can sit down in foreign policy or other issues and find a common interest and drive the ideas forward look at what he did with jesse helms and strom thurmond in passing the chemical weapons treaty and crime bills respectively in the s his former chief of staff and later successor ted kaufman noted back then i mean jesse helms and strom thurmond you do not get more conservative than that let us remember biden is debate performance in  he faced his republican counterpart representative paul ryan in the lone  vice presidential debate on october th in danville kentucky there he made a feisty emotional defense of the obama administration is record and energetically attacked the republican ticket this helped the obama campaign regain momentum after obama is first lackluster debate performance biden is most important role within the obama administration was to question assumptions playing a contrarian role obama said that the best thing about joe is that when we get everybody together he really forces people to think and defend their positions to look at things from every angle and that is very valuable for me another senior obama advisor said biden is always prepared to be the skunk at the family picnic to make sure we are as intellectually honest as possible and on and on and on is joe biden a perfect human being of course not who is but is biden an intelligent man who could bring a lot of important experience and skill to the white house at a time when we desperately need to be rid of donald trump hell yes and let us once again emphasize biden polls very well against trump compared to other democratic candidates who either have far less experience are too ideologically extreme or both i say we need joe biden,1

disclaimer the following blog post includes discussion of social issues it is adapted from a coming book by william thomas harriman tom and is published on this page by david perry both page and blog have been strictly nonpartisan from inception finding our strength we have choices to make they might differ from the choices we are used to thinking about but these are not normal times indeed it appears the challenges before us are likely to worsen before they get  better faced with crises and instability we turn our attention to safety and our local community is where that needs to happen shall we strengthen dependability with our neighbors and build supportive relationships or pretend that every day will be like the last when the world is breaking down and hardship grows we can always find common cause with our neighbors we need people in our lives who have the practical knowledge and skills to help resolve local problems  whatever their politics or religion or the color of their skin this is a choice that calls for wisdom and initiative common sense really but the first step is always ours to take the road to security is built with civility and paved with trust building community can be hard work but it is the only certain protection from calamity conflict is natural in relationships yet differences can only be fully understood and surmounted in and through relationships it is in the work on interpersonal relations that direct and honest communication can take place the means for making this fractious process possible and effective in america is the subject of this blog and my forthcoming book yet it will not succeed unless we believe it is worth the effort some may say its too late i say that americans are courageous resourceful resilient the united states was conceived in controversy and the vision of the founders came with recognition that wisdom and strength are found in diversity indeed it is argued here that diversity is the foundation for strength and that the united states constitution is a visionary assertion of this belief the founders gave us a structure it is our responsibility to make it work we are confronted today by one of the great tests of american history a challenge to the intent embodied in the constitution and the coherence of a vision that has been gradually maturing for more than two hundred years perhaps we have lost our way at times stumbled gotten sloppy but now it is time to pull together it is argued here that we must begin in our local communities  the historic home to democracy and the seat of civilization stability cannot be imposed from above in a free society the kind of strength we seek is grounded in trust and dependability in personal relations this is the nature of genuine community i am not talking about a recovery from crisis in the normal sense rather i submit that we stand at the threshold of an unprecedented turning point  a crossroads that offers a unique window of opportunity for americans to affirm and uphold our exceptional and multifaceted identity as a nation in navigating through an extraordinary confluence of crises we will be forced to renew our values think on our feet and make both pragmatic and ethical adjustments a creative process is now underway that would not be possible otherwise we need to assess our shared values and rethink the generosity of spirit that once made america so attractive to the world if american communities are to emerge into a vibrant matrix of local and regional networks they will depend on citizens with diverse skills and varied perspectives people who are capable of teamwork and practical problemsolving resistance to diversity is often caused by discomfort with those who look or think differently or who come from unfamiliar cultural backgrounds yet in crises it is differences in perspective that allow effective problemsolving we cannot afford to do without this you should feel confidence in your own ideas and values yes but why should we be afraid to hear and understand different ways of thinking the strength in calm composure brings us clear mindedness and the ability to listen well the opportunity to explore the world through the eyes of those different from ourselves is a blessing and a gift and in the event of social collapse it may be the key to survival tom a note to readers you may look for the next post on or about february  new readers can find a project description an introduction to the coming book and drafts of several chapters at the primary blog site wwwfreedomstruthnet new chapters have recently been added including one on freedom and individualism,1

my love for philly runs deep so does my desire to make the lives of its actors equity association members better my thoughts on philadelphia are here and at sidforaeacom  one of the great privileges of being equity is eastern regional vice president is being able to attend the annual membership meetings in each of the region is liaison areas and despite spending most of my first year as vp out on the road with the play that goes wrong i was still able to creatively m  anage my travel schedule and get to some of these very important meetings im happy to say that philadelphia was my very first i have a long history with the city of brotherly love as my dad is side of the family is from the area he grew up in haddonfield i played street hockey with my cousins in cheltenham as a kid i still have aunts and uncles and cousins living in cherry hill and one of my sisters even went to college at bryn mawr my childhood was filled with trips to the franklin institute the art institute franklin court and tours of the us mint we were nerds and there was almost always a stop in chinatown involved needless to say my love for philly runs deep so when i heard there was a meeting scheduled in philadelphia for a monday night i jumped at the chance to go we wrapped up our run at the kennedy center the night before and were starting performances in toronto on tuesday i hopped a train from dc to th street and hauled my bags onto a marketfrankford line train to get to my hotel now at this point two years into my vice presidency ive been to a lot of membership meetings some i remember more broadly with my takeaways centered on certain themes or general concerns that the members seem to have reached consensus around for some meetings though the lingering memories are of very specific interactions i have with individual members and such was the case with that very first meeting in philadelphia i will never forget what one of our members said to me that night she was a woman who was obviously a respected local actorshe knew everyone in the room and her words commanded immediate attention and respect she said i worked on an equity contract during almost every week of the past year and yet i do not qualify for health coverage why is that allowed there were lots of nods of approval from the members in attendance here was a wellknown and constantly employed union worker and yet she had no benefits to show for a year is worth of work it opened a great conversation and exposed an obvious need there are an extraordinary number of full equity employers in the philadelphia areafour theaters using the lort contract just within the city limits more than a dozen spts plus about a half dozen loaswith many of their contracts going to local stage managers and actors but there are also more than two dozen producers using prepaid agreements like special appearancea contract that does not come with required health payments nor the robust provisions of a full equity agreement equity is prepaid agreements were designed as organizing toolsgiving smaller theaters an opportunity to dip their toes into the water of using equity members with the goal of eventually negotiating them onto full agreements in the near future but there was an obvious frustration at this meeting that many longestablished producers has simply set up shop as special appearance users with no seeming intention of ever leveling up this member who spoke up should be credited with planting a seed that has the potential to bear some pretty significant fruit for our members in philadelphia and beyond since that meeting ialong with some fellow councilors and equity staffershave been doing a comprehensive review of our organizing model examining not only how we determine when it is appropriate for a producer to use these prepaid agreements but also formulating and codifying an idea for a better model for independent theaters it is very often a perception of inflexibility of equity contracts that scares potential bargaining partners away from becoming full equity producers im hopeful that this new model being conceived of will empower our business reps to negotiate contracts that are more relevant to the needs of philadelphia members and producers allowing for longlasting mutuallybeneficial relationships moving forward and creating incentive for more producers to partner with us as we all seek to emerge from our current crisis together this will be a key piece of moving towards a muchneeded memberdriven recovery in my next term as eastern regional vice president i will be working hard to see this project through to its fruition and i will always be eternally grateful to this woman who chose to speak up and helped start a process of change for our members and our union  fwoc  sidforaea wwwsidforaeacomphiladelphiahtml,1

sign and share the open letter from young american jews to nancy pelosi and chuck schumer  the election gave us mixed results but in this dark time we saw many rays of light florida voted to reenfranchise  million people over  women  half of whom are women of color  are headed to congress for the first time and for the first time in two years the house will finally provide a check on trump and the gop although our broken electoral system does not reflect thi  s the majority of americans rejected white nationalism and a politics of hate and division the stakes of this election were high for us after the murder of  jews in pittsburghs tree of life synagogue less than two weeks ago we watched republican candidates and elected officials all the way up to the white house double down on antisemitic tropes and racist ads in races across the country the gop cynically fell in line around a message of hate and division to protect their diminishing power and relevance even as incidents of hate crimes against marginalized communities spike so we were surprised and disappointed to hear speaker pelosi begin talking about pursuing a bipartisan marketplace of ideas minutes after democrats took the house just as we were disappointed to watch sen schumer continue to blame both the left and the right after a bomb was sent to george soros address this kind of acquiescence and false equivalency is an absolute failure of leadership as american jews we call on you to fight for us and for our friends in communities across this country who are under attack do not plead for civility do not spend the next two years reaching across the aisle to compromise with a party which welcomes nazi sympathizers into its ranks or appealing to a nonexistent center do not conflate standing up against antisemitism and hate with blind support for netanyahus government we were horrified by cory bookers cynical move to cosponsor antibds legislation in the wake of the pittsburgh shooting to use our grief to repress free speech standing with jews in the moment means standing for the rights and freedoms that every person in this country in israelpalestine and throughout the world deserves our generation wont sit back and watch until  young voters like us turned out in historical numbers and  of us  historic highs  voted against trumps party of hate as young american jews who know that our community is future depends on defeating white nationalism we will continue to protest in the streets challenge elected officials in the halls of power and build solidarity so we can achieve an america that works for all of us this isnt a fight for which party is in power its a fight for the soul of our country and the future of our world our generation is leading pelosi and schumer its not too late to join us,1

"pdn op ed we need a lot more new faces in the legislature
it is apparent gov lou leon guerrero is becoming the perfect example of the old adage power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely
the democrat and republican parties are totally dysfunctional as political entities no longer worthy of support by citizens as the only political parties on guam recognized by the guam election commission they exert so much control it is damned near impossible for an independent candidate or candidates of a new political party to run for office
both political parties have abandoned political ideology and embraced the cult of family politics you would be very hard pressed to find any common thread uniting the candidates in one party other than family and business relationships
another reason the governor has absolute power is the lack of a loyal opposition party i find it odd community advocacy groups are the only opposition
where are the republicans voices they are too busy playing family politics that is why the republican party continues to act as if the highest votegetting republican in the legislature three elections in a row sen mary torres does not exist
the democrats are no better considering the highest votegetting democrat candidate two elections in a row therese terlaje has been passed over for the title of speaker in favor of a politically wellconnected insider tina muna barnes was a low vote getter and appears to be focused on seeing adelup getting everything it needs to harvest the public purse to reward other politically wellconnected insiders with highpaying jobs and sweetheart contracts
with the covid pandemic it is not feasible to go doortodoor collecting signatures or hold public rallies which will put the voter initiative process on hold until further notice but that does not end the process to make sweeping changes to our government to make it more citizen friendly than politically wellconnected insider friendly
until the pandemic is over we citizens are going to have to work very hard to elect  or more new senators willing to put public service over pork barrel politics that is the only way we will increase the number of senators from  back to  go to a parttime legislature to dramatically increase the pool of potential candidates for office and eliminate the primary election which serves primarily as a major barrier for new faces to challenge incumbent politicians
and more importantly in light of the actions we are seeing done with under the pandemic excuse we must have senators willing to introduce and pass the corrupt practices act that will allow citizens to take legal action against government officials and employees who break laws rules and regulations in such a manner as to cost taxpayers money
remember the wise words of albert einstein who said the very definition of insanity is to keep doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results the election is coming and a chance to change that paradigm forever by electing  or more new faces to the legislature and give them a chance to prove if they are going to serve the people or serve politically wellconnected insiders
this coming august we get a chance to send a message to politicians that the pork barrel buffet is closed we do that by electing  fresh new faces to the legislature and vote out ten politicians that have made serving the needs wants and desires of adelup and politically well connected insiders more important that serving the needs of the people

"the eu recovery package a response to the severe consequences of the covid pandemic and the need for a speedy economic recovery
at the epp group meeting we discussed the eu recovery package and the commission is proposals on this package in response to the severe consequences of the covid pandemic and the need for a speedy economic recovery
it is not yet clear what this package will entail number and type of legislation as these will also be determined by the legal basis chosen for the creation of the new eu recovery fund however it looks like the package will be based on the following pillars
 a revision of the commission is proposal on mff 
 a revision of the commission is proposal on the decision on own resources ro
 an act establishing the new eu recovery fund
 a revision of several legislative proposals establishing the eu programs for the period  as foreseen in the recovery package
the commission will present the proposals on the eu recovery package in plenary on the day of their adoption
a resolution on the new mff own resources and recovery plan was adopted by a very large majority  in parliament is plenary session in may setting out the following expectations regarding the main features of the package
full involvement of parliament in the design adoption and implementation of the recovery plan for reasons of democratic legitimacy and parliamentary oversight the european recovery strategy cannot be built outside the community method
the recovery plan should not be funded to the detriment of the mff and its policies the recovery and transformation fund should be calculated above the level of the next mff the longterm priorities of the year mff cannot be jeopardized in order to provide immediate funding for the recovery strategy
parliament is ready not to agree on the mff without an agreement on the eu is own resources and to reject proposals leading to a reduced mff due to recovery and not to guarantee parliament is participation and democratic scrutiny in the new architecture fond
a permanent increase in the own resources ceiling should be agreed in anticipation of a decrease in gni and allow for the financing of the recovery and transformation fund the fund should be financed by longterm recovery bonds guaranteed by the eu budget maximizing the main chamber and subject to a repayment plan
the fund will be a key component of a global package that will provide an investment boost including by attracting  trillion in private investment and will have a duration appropriate to the impact of the current crisis
the package should be settled through loans and in particular grants direct payments for investments and equity the fund will be managed directly by the commission
the fund should not place additional burdens on national treasuries new own resources to cover emission rebates and also cfm funding maintaining the gnibased resource at the current nominal level is specifically mentioned if member states accept the eu is own resources

dear elected representatives of yonkers i am writing to express my opposition to the proposed ups facility at  tuckahoe road in yonkers my motherinlaw raised seven children in this home on bonnie briar road and the activity at that facility if allowed to proceed will destroy the quality of life for her and the entire neighborhood and will also lower property values of the immediate neighborhood why are not our elected representatives preventing this degradation of  yonkers life from happening there will be  semi trailers coming into that property every day beginning at  am and nearly  ups trucks what about the air quality for the neighborhood will ups be providing them with personal protective equipment will the city of yonkers bear the financial cost of additional ailments due to poor air quality i dont believe that gas tanks holding thousands of gallons of gasolineeither above ground or below groundare permitted in the cm zoning where the facility is located i would like to hear from the planning board the definitive answer on that particular question and must ask why our elected representatives are not asking such questions themselves ups has been deceptive on the number of parking spaces they are adding saying at times  but pointing out a space lot and a space lot again i would like to hear from the planning board what they believe the exact number of parking spots that will be created and again must ask why our elected representatives are not asking such questions on behalf of the neighborhood according to the presentation ups actually hopes to eliminate jobs by establishing this facility specifically they hope to eliminate  drivers see page  the evidence suggests that ups hopes to displace older rundown facilities in elmsford and the bronx for example it appears ups would remove all the green space that remains to add parking spaces see page  at a meeting of the yonkers planning commission on july   the facilitys property owners who still own the property confirmed their commitment as a condition to build the hampton inn that they will never develop the remaining green space again i would like to hear from the planning board some of whom were members at that time why they are not requiring the property owner to honor that commitment and again must ask why our elected representatives are not protecting their constituents by blocking this development the plan also calls for a middle turn lane added on tuckahoe road this will especially have an impact on grassy sprain village the additional traffic will cause traffic tieups on tuckahoe road between two street lights that are one city block long apart has the yonkers fire department been asked to look at this plan and if not why have not their advice and consent been sought such an expansion as this would normally require an environmental impact report under the circumstances why is the planning board approving this without requiring an environmental impact report the activity of  tractor trailersday beginning at am and  ups package trucks throughout the day will have a huge impact on traffic safety and the belief that a sound wall will mitigate the noise is downright laughableit will be as effective against sound and pollution as it would be against a virus again why is not an environmental impact report being requested what about the air quality of the neighborhood there are many other reasons i oppose this development and i believe the majority of residents also oppose this development it is a sad state affairs that the government and the board is steamrolling this development through without giving the neighbors the proper opportunity to respond,1

i wasnt sure about writing a book on addiction especially my addiction  but then i read a study that completely changed my mind it shows just how important it is that we all change how we talk about addiction and how we view those struggling with addiction   two researchers leake and king went to three different alcohol recovery centers and started analyzing the files and data on the patients there    at the end of their time they told the staff at these centers which clients they believed were most likely to recover   the researchers then tracked the progress of everyone leaving the center   a year later the individuals they identified were still more likely than the rest to be employed and sober and to have had fewer and shorter relapses   what had the researchers observed that allowed them to so accurately predict success   nothing   leake and king randomly assigned people to be on the list of those with a high chance of recovery   they didnt tell the patients only the staff   what changed is that the staff were more likely to believe that someone could recover when the beliefs of the staff changed so did the outcomes   it doesnt end there   another study showed that just the tone of voice a doctor uses judgmental vs empathetic can change the likelihood of someone recovering   small changes can have an outsized impact   i truly believe that  if we change what we believe about those who are addicted we can curb the tide of the overdose epidemic   so yes i hope you check out the book but most of all i hope you are a part of changing the conversation,1

how not to conduct a trade war president donald trump has taken the united states into an allout trade war with the rest of the world his america first stance has led him to rip up trade agreements and to impose tariffs on just about every other country global trade is a very complicated matter that should not be meddled with lightly there are consequences to just about every action i have assembled here ten donts of trade wars in case he might want to read up on th  e matter  dont put tariffs on material that your country needs president trump has put a  tariff on aluminum coming in from many different countries but most importantly from canada and in particular quebec aluminum requires massive amounts of electricity for the smelting of bauxite into a lightweight metal quebec has this electricity because of their massive power dams the united states requires this metal to make airplanes and other light weight vehicles and a tariff will only increase the cost of these products  dont underestimate your opponents resolve the european union has had a  tariff imposed on all of the steel that they export to the united states the eu president recently said that the duties imposed went against all logic and history and we will do what we have to do to rebalance and safeguard the eu they imposed tariffs on us bourbon motorcycles and orange juice  dont meddle with another countries internal policies canada has a supply management system for controlling the production of milk using a quota system this effectively restricts american milk products from entering canada donald trump is insisting that we scrap this program but he does not understand the local issues and politics behind milk marketing whether we keep a milk quota system is a decision that canadians need to make for ourselves not because of a presidents demands  dont fight more than one battle at a time trump has imposed a  tariff on  million tonnes of steel that is imported into the us which he hopes will spur on increased steel production at home unfortunately there are  countries that export steel to the us suddenly he has declared a trade war on  enemies at once he now has countervailing duties being imposed by canada mexico and the european union with china soon to be imposing tariffs as well  dont impose tariffs on products when you have products that are vulnerable the farm belt in the midwestern united states grows an enormous amount of soybeans of which  million tonnes is exported to other countries particularly china well china has started to cancel their orders for american soybeans worth  billion and has started to place orders in other countries such as canada and brazil  dont screw up supply chains the automobile industry is fully integrated for the large car manufacturers in north america president trump does not understand that  of the parts in the cars that are made in canada come from parts plants in the united states impose tariffs on cars made in canada and you lose car parts jobs in the us  dont put tariffs on products that your congressmen and senators want donald trump wants to punish canada for putting tariffs on american products because he put tariffs on ours he wants to put a  tariff on cars made in canada he doesnt know that canada makes lincolns cadillacs and lexus cars that the cost of buying one of these cars in the us would be  more and that it would cost americans an extra  billion to buy canadian cars  dont presume that companies are loyal to the united states harley davidson motorcycles have become pawns in trump is trade fight with europe in retaliation for trumps steel tariffs they have imposed tariffs on donald trumps favourite american company harley davidson has shown their lack of loyalty to trump and america by stating that they would be moving some of their manufacturing to asia  dont start a trade war with a country that owns your debt donalds trade war with china has escalated with him imposing tariffs on  billion of chinese goods a very serious matter that he should remember is that china owns  of the united states debt in treasury bills dont fight with someone who can bankrupt you  dont make enemies of your friends president trump called prime minister justin trudeau very dishonest and weak well he made a miracle happen in our country he united all parties in passing a unanimous vote stating the house of commons stands united in solidarity on the canadian retaliatory measures to the us and rejects disparaging ad hominem statements by the us administration which do a disservice to bilateral relations and will fail to resolve this trade dispute donald should know that he is going to have to be friends with canada after his trade war is over if you enjoy the countryside view blog please feel free to follow us here or keep an eye out for it at its new home at kingstonist  httpkingstonistcom,1

its time to admit that theres the very real possibility the president is no longer concerned with the support of we the people and has his eyes set on the far more absolute rule that comes through violence and intimidation history shows again and again the incredible cost in human lives when those who choose the pathway of fear anger and hate go unchecked that we still have the ability to do that with votes is why this election is so veryvery important thank you for a  ll your support and interest this election season these days posts here from businesses really are what ads used to be facebook has bills its fair but with your interest clicks likes shares and especially your comments in the lead up to todays election youve made our posts act almost like they were solar powered funding themselves to reach far beyond the places posts like ours ever get to travel thank you greatly for this once this election is over theres a good chance our posts wont likely reach you nearly as often if you like the feeling of hope our reality of cooking brings and the regular reminder that you really are not alone in caring about others theres much to be said for signing up for our voice of cooking emails from our lifetime around cooks weve learned theyre awesome spending more time with cooks is always a good thing to do you can sign up for penzeys voice of cooking here httpspicespenzeyscomcouponhtml and with your support weve come a long way our to cook is to care to care is to vote really worked as a counter to the anger and fearbased voter turnout messages of the republican party it seems the decency of cooks the power of cooking to share the values of compassion and the goodness set in motion when we take care of others has hit all the right notes in this time when those on the right have been marching to a very different tune with all this going on when first discussing what should go in our final  campaign for kindness election offer gift box the kind pin and the embrace hope pin were clear first choices and i thought the heal the world magnet would be a nice addition if possible upon hearing of the synagog shooting in our old squirrel hill neighborhood of pittsburgh the heal the world message became a must for us its so clear cooks really do heal the world their day after day kindness and compassion are pretty much the glue that keeps the human race from falling apart a million years ago we started to cook over tens of thousands of generations cooking taught us true strength is not the ability to drive others away true strength is the ability to welcome others in this ability to gather others around the fire is what ultimately gave humans the responsibility of leadership of the animal world and it was americas willingness to let others in that ultimately brought us leadership in the world since we first introduced our heal the world art ive had many good conversations and emails with people of jewish faith about how healing the world is even more than a core belief in their faith its a call to action that the members of the tree of life synagogue should have become targeted by fear and hate for their kindness and compassion brings such great sadness and leaves us all with so much healing to do i have no doubt in the strength of their community or in their ability to overcome but it is time for us all as americans to admit their community is our community and for us all to rise up to stop the hate at the heart of this its time to admit that the fear and hate is not being generated by some fringe group but instead by the president of our united states how much longer will we go on saying what he is doing makes no sense how much longer will we act like his lack of desire to create support from a majority of voters is somehow him not understanding how america works the time has come to admit that what the president is doing is completely logical if he is no longer concerned with having the support of we the people and has his eyes set instead on the far more absolute rule that comes through the power made possible with violence and intimidation history shows again and again the incredible cost in human lives when those who choose the pathway of fear anger and hate are left unchecked that we still have the ability to do that with votes is why this election is so veryvery important and yes heal the world its time to get back to the humanity at the heart of what actually makes america great lets get back to welcoming in our share of the worlds refugees you might ask why should it be our job to heal the world because as americans weve been given the gift of what until now has been a life free from fascism it is a gift given to the vast majority of us by those who allowed the open immigration that let in our wretched refuse ancestors by the millions ellis island alone took in a couple of these caravans we are now supposed to be so frightened of every single day if you could walk up three flights of stairs congratulations you were a legal american resident with how far theyve already come these caravan people seem more than capable of making it up three flights of stairs which is good because we need them india and china are not standing still with future economies based as much on population as on production if we are to be competitive in the future we need more americans we have  the population density of germany we have the room we have the need the time has come to do the right thing vote today and take everyone you can to vote with you this one matters today is the final day for our free with  purchase  value hope and kindness gift box weve arrived at our last pitch of our choose kindness  election with our embrace hope pin kind heart pin heal the world bumperrefrigerator magnet and halfcup jar of our really tasty roasted garlic all packed into a happy little yellow penzeys box its a nice box that so pleasantly holds all the

an important message for my fellow illinoisans good evening illinois its a shame that abc  chicago decided to exclude  of the candidates running for governor after working diligently for the last two weeks to convince abc to allow all four candidates on the debate stage i have nothing left to say to them but i do have something to say to you the people of illinois it is obvious that a vote for pritzker is a vote to make madigan the de facto governor of our great state it is also equally obvious that a vote for rauner is a vote to allow madigan to continue to be the de facto governor of our state we all know that a pritzker governorship would put the chicago democratic machine in total control of illinois state government which would be the death of our great state as we know it we also know that rauner is a failure and would bring four more years of the same failure to the governors office we simply cannot afford four more years of any elected official that allowed veterans to become sick and even die while deliberately suppressing details of a deadly epidemic at the quincy veterans home for selfdealing political gain the illinois attorney general has appropriately launched an investigation into criminal wrongdoing on the part of rauner and his administration i call on the attorney general to request that the us department of justice and the fbi take the lead on this investigation the last thing we need is a progressive chicago billionaire who as the inspector general of cook county just reported allegedly orchestrated and engaged in a scheme to fraudulently reduce his own property tax burden while the rest of us struggle to keep our heads above water with the everrising onslaught of higher and higher property taxes year after year unlike pritzker i will work to remove madigan from his recordbreaking term as speaker where he keeps a stranglehold on the people of illinois unlike rauner i wont have to ask madigan permission to be in charge as he infamously confessed in chicago on december th  it should go without saying that the governorship of a major state does not come with on the job training  you have to be ready to lead from day one i am the only candidate running for governor that is prepared in every way to lead our state into a stronger and more prosperous tomorrow but i cant do it alone this is where you the people come in you not the media not the parties and definitely not madigan are in control of this election i implore you to be brave enough to vote for the illinois that you want not the illinois that the dueling parties the lobbyists the billionaires and the backroom dealers have convinced us for far too long is the best that we can do we can do better and we will do better i am asking for your vote to be your next governor of illinois lets rebuild illinois together senator sam mccann  october rd,1

trump is message to congress stop being afraid of the nra,0
"today i spoke at the california assembly is committee of the whole on the california state budget this unprecedented hearing allowed my colleagues and i to ask questions about the problems facing our state and discuss potential solutions following are my remarks from the floor
as a family that was struck with covid we know all too well the fear and uncertainty this virus can bring we struggled to find tests and i had to tell my daughter the virus that had ended her school year that was keeping us at home that had stopped the world in its tracks was now a part of our lives
the hardest part of the last couple months was that i could not promise my daughter that her dad would be okay
what i could promise was that no matter what i would love her and take care of her to the best of my experience knowledge and ability
it is also a promise that i made to every californian child the day i was sworn in
it is because of that promise that i rise to speak today
our stay at home restrictions have necessarily but artificially constrained supply
demand is still there
those who can still want to buy you can see it in the lines at grocery stores and in the thousands of delivery trucks running around our cities
people want to buy and we have to make sure businesses can respond to that demand by being able to among other things find trained and qualified employees
the deep severity and rapid onset of this recession has fallen hardest on those who can least afford it
these workers are relying on our social safety net in order to weather this storm
calworks is projected to see caseloads increase to  about a  increase
 of recipients are people of color
these numbers deeply disturb me and underscore the need to create options for calworks participants as we navigate these unchartered waters
i am however encouraged by the governor is decision to continue the flexible eligibility requirements in calworks a change that i have proposed to make permanent in ab 
i am disheartened by the nearly  million cut to the expanded subsidized employment program within calworks
we made similar cuts in our last recession and it greatly deteriorated the infrastructure of those programs
we will need to make sure we are able to teach the skills necessary to strengthen our essential workforce this should be coupled with ways to transition from high physical exposure jobs to working from home
i urge the governor to reconsider the drastic cuts to workforce development programs that can bolster our economic recovery
if we cannot promise our constituents a job right now at the very least we should be able to provide access to training so that when the time comes a living wage is no longer a dream but a reality
as chair of the revenue and taxation committee i am fully aware of the fiscal challenges we face
our general fund revenue relies heavily on personal income tax without safeguarding existing jobs and creating more opportunities for workers to earn a living wage we are making the choice to limit our economic potential and recovery
while i am thankful that the administration has not called for an increase in tax rates we are still being asked to limit the degree to which companies can use previously earned tax credits these are companies engaging in socially useful behavior like union work on environmental projects building homes for the poor and researching new technologies
if we are not in a position to honor those investments in the short term we should at the very least be thinking about how we can lift other burdens on the very businesses we will need to carry us into a more hopeful future
additionally we cannot talk about the importance of workforce development without including our k system
students in my district lack the devices and connectivity to engage in remote learning severely jeopardizing their educational opportunities and highlight the digital divide that exists in lowincome urban areas
i would be remiss if i did not also include the greatest obstacle currently facing the children of california housing insecurity
we cannot fully recover from this pandemic physically or economically until every family and child has a home
now more than ever we are aware of how many individuals and families are one paycheck away from being homeless
working towards a comprehensive solution including prevention emergency shelter and a permanent affordable home is imperative
i want to close by saying thank you to the speaker anthony rendon for having this hearing today
i like my colleagues believe being elected to office is a great responsibility
i value the work and insight of the lao and they are correct the legislature must guard its authority
i believe in this body the very people elected to it and the people that placed their faith in us and i believe our budget and its process should reflect our values
thank you",1

you cant make up stuff this good this past week we all learned that sara james the texasbased campaign operative working for brat has been using powers given to her by brat to drive probrat narratives on his facebook page and deleting constituent comments that did not fit this narrative anyone who cares about democracy and public discourse ought to be dismayed by this but for those who appreciate irony and hypocrisy the whole story would make a great afterschool  special consider the following when faced with a nationwide movement opposing president trump representative brat and others on the far right brat dismissed the movement as nothing more than paid protestors paid activists and people being paid to go around and raise havoc when asked about the fierce opposition he was encountering at his town halls brat deflected the opposition saying that many of the attendees were from out of his district when asked by his constituents for his opinion on white supremacist richard spencers upcoming rally in charlottesville brat responded not by condemning white supremacy but by defending spencers right to free speech sodave thinks its bad if outofstaters are paid to raise havoc and that everybodys right to free speech should be respected if thats so then why was dave paying a woman from texas who spent her time criticizing his constituents and using authority granted to her by him deleted their comments from facebook page call him and ask when does he plan to have a town hall and answer some of these questions httpwwwrichmondcomarticle_abdbfee,1

"campaign promises is the subject of this tuesday is video i know sometimes you are not where you can watch the video so i posted a roughdraft of the message below thanks for listening or reading i appreciate your vote in november
good evening and thanks for watching this short video as we begin to see businesses open back up and people are starting to get out and about more we are looking forward to the day that we can start having some campaign events and meet with the voters of chattooga county in person right now it looks like it will be sometime the middle to the end of june before that happens
i know that a lot of people have a lot of different ideas about the covid pandemic and how we all should be reacting at this time so with that in mind when we do start to do campaign events we will not be doing doortodoor campaigning for now some people do not mind someone coming by but others are still wary of allowing someone into their home or coming into contact with more people than are necessary also we still have a shelter in place order for the elderly and those with compromised immunity so i do not feel it would be right for me at this time to come doortodoor with that in mind we are tentatively making some plans for events that will be held in various parts of the county where you can come by and talk with me we can maintain social distancing and still be able to have a oneonone conversation about the issues affecting chattooga county i will keep you updated on those plans in the upcoming tuesday videos and you can always visit my web site at jimmyforcommissionercom or on facebook plus i always welcome you to call me at 
every week we have had more and more people getting on board with this campaign and the vision for a better chattooga county i continue to have conversations with people from all political persuasions and various backgrounds about issues that they find important in conversations with folks over the past week i have been asked a specific question about a specific road that needs repair in the county and was told i will vote for you if you will fix my road the voter and i had a good conversation about the need for better road maintenance in the county but i also had to tell this person that i will not make any campaign promises simply to get a vote
the fact is if you choose to vote for me in november you are putting your trust in me to do the job of sole commissioner i do not just want that trust to get me into office i want the citizens of this county to be able to trust their commissioner to do what they say if i make promises i do not know if i can keep i cannot expect you to trust me to do the job i know we all get aggravated with politicians and that is why i am running i am not a career politician and i do not need to be commissioner for any other reason than i want to see our county headed in a better direction if i do not care enough about you the voter that i make a promise i do not know if i can keep then how can i expect you to put your trust in me
the biggest problem our county is facing right now is a lack of financial direction it would not be responsible of me or any other candidate to make a bunch of specific promises just to get into office because quite frankly our budgeting needs a lot of work what i can promise everyone is that when i am commissioner i will meet with citizens to discuss road and infrastructure issues i plan to hold a series of public meetings where the residents of the county can come in and speak about these issues then i plan to make a list of priorities and develop a longterm plan for fixing the issues now i know that where you live is rightfully the most important area to you so i plan to hear what people have to say and then begin to systematically address the issues once we develop a list of priorities we will then do a cost analysis on each project and prioritize those areas in the budget then we will publish that list on the internet and on social media and provide the list to local media
you see i believe that i must be accountable to you the voter publically i know that there have been many candidates over the years that have made promises in private and have then denied them in public i would much rather tell you that your road might not be fixed this year but we have it on the list for the next year than i had make you a promise just to get a vote or just to pacify the moment by looking at our list of needed road and infrastructure improvements that are published for everyone to see you the voter will know what your county is doing with your tax dollars and you will have the confidence that i as your commissioner am doing everything i can to address issues across the county aboveboard
what i am talking about is a new way to do county government as your sole commissioner i will be the one that you will approach when you have an issue i also know that the ultimate decision will be with me but i also want to involve as many people as possible in process that leads me to a decision that is why i will hold regular monthly meetings these meetings will be held for inperson comment and also will be held online where internet viewers can comment as well at those monthly meetings we will have people from public works the water district public transit and other county departments who can answer questions and help find solutions for the many issues that our county residents are facing
everything i do as your commissioner will be available for public scrutiny and inspection from our budget to our current and future plans the citizens of this county deserve to know how their county government is operating after all it is our money folks our property and sales tax dollars do not belong to a politician they belong to we the people
i hope to continue this conversation between now and november i am interested in talking with you and hearing from you please contact me on facebook or email me at jimmyforcommissionergmailcom or call me at 
i appreciate you taking the time to watch this video and look forward to speaking with you again next week",1

the total and complete heartbreak of not being able to save them all    on friday sept st at am animal control employees arrived to work at the carsonlos angeles county animal shelter they found two cocker spaniels that had been tied up to the gate of the shelter parking lot both dogs clearly had been outdoor dogs matted dirty  but one dog was emaciated and very weak the municipal animal shelters are not set up to operate as animal hospitals the shelter sent the sickly dog to an outside vet to get a more thorough exam camp cocker rescue had driven more than two hours one way to the carson shelter that same day to meet both dogs and get our name on them so that we could have first chance to get them once their stray hold was up we did not get to meet the sickly cocker because he was already sent out to a private vet later on that day the shelter phoned us to say that the sickly dog had to be euthanized because he was suffering and was in a state of crisis we learned after he had been euthanized that the private vet had said he was flea infested and severely anemic and the only way to save his life would have been a blood transfusion this was crushing news to us because we would have taken him to a specialty hospital to get a blood transfusion and attempted to save his life he was on a stray hold though and legally the shelter was in a grey area if they had released the dog to us that was still on stray hold and we had done major medical treatments on him to save his life the owners could have come forward to claim the dog and we would have been forced to return him that is always a gamble in these situations but we wish that the shelter had thought to call us and give us that option we spoke to one of the supervisors there and asked them to please let all of the staff know that in the future if there is ever a cocker spaniel that they are considering euthanizing due to major medical to please call us asap because we want to have the chance to step in in the shelter is defense they are dealing with situations like this all of the time they are not set up to triage animals like an emergency animal hospital and this shelter is in a more low income area so it is common to see animals turn up at the shelter that are in dire need of medical care the whole thing was heartbreaking absolutely heartbreaking we were able to rescue the other dog and his new name is now pumpkin pumpkin is the dog on the left his friend is the emaciated dog on the right pumpkin is a skittish shy dog and this confirms our hunch that these were someone is backyard dogs that were never socialized or vettted or cared for in any way in honor of pumpkin is friend whom we never met we would like to posthumously honor him by giving him a nice name and including his picture on our calendar for next year we have a rainbow bridge section where he will be featured would you like to make a small donation today in honor of pumpkin is friend and also contribute some name suggestions we will be putting them all in a jar and pulling a name out so he can have the dignity of a name and a place in our calendar to remember him by donations can be made directly here on this special donate link there is a place to enter your name suggestions on that link,1

did you know that a constitution can be written or unwritten i like to use the example of teenage drivers as an illustration theres usually an unwritten constitution in the home about the use of the car the teen is limited to where they can go with the car must put gas in the tank before returning and must put the keys back in the designated spot this makes the shared use of the car amenable to all of the drivers in the family as we continue in our study of the   year leap skousen w cleon the five thousand year leap  ideas that changed the world national center for constitutional studies  we find this th principle of liberty the unalienable rights of the people are most likely to be preserved if the principles of government are set forth in a written constitution note that skousen says our unalienable rights need to be written down it wasnt always that way he informs us that the tradition of written constitutions in modern times is not of english origin but is entirely american both in principle and practice ibid p skousen also gives us a history lesson on the constitution in america he tells us that the founding fathers sought the counsel wisdom and experience of many if youve ever served on a committee you know how it goes the bigger the committee the harder it is to reach a consensus but our founders were against rule by a few they wanted a system of government run by we the people so they worked through a process to have our constitution written down in its entirety we have that document readily available on our phones computers in libraries bookstores and in schools it is not hidden or subject to change on the whim of a few every generation has read it most can tell you that it starts with we the people not readily memorized is the th amendment which is the subject of skousens th principle of liberty he breaks it down like this only limited and carefully defined powers should be delegated to government all others being retained in the people the th amendment says the powers not delegated to the united states by the constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people this principle got a ton of attention at the constitutional convention throughout our study we have seen that limiting the power of the federal government was upmost in the founders minds we are reminded in this chapter of humans love of power the people at the top dont like their power constrained our founders knew the difficulty of restraint in government and the human tendency to be selfish so they wrote governments limitations into our constitution and bill of rights our founders wanted no part of absolute power being given to anyone absolutely thats just how we the people roll and thats common sense civics and citizenship note please refrain from naming blaming or shaming political parties or personalities no additional links let us focus on learning from each other is insights to gain a deeper understanding of what it takes to remain a free people,1

chapter from savage the man across the alley scanned the streets waiting and watching that he was a spy for grundal was common knowledge and not a particularly good one at that but it meant that grundal was looking for her not a good scenario grundal had far more competent and dangerous men working for him shed have to be careful and get him some money soon lifting her hood over her head kyra let her shoulders sink and her head drop towards the ground she slowly  shuffled out onto the street walking straight pass the spy as she stepped towards him she turned and coughed then spoke in a gravely voice spare a coin for a starving grandmother the spys brow furrowed as he looked pass her trying to make sure his intended target wasnt in the busy crowded street get lost you old goat im busy well i never kyra huffed and then shuffled her way around the corner she kept up her old lady guise for the rest of her walk there was no telling who else was out there watching when she finally reached her destination kyra opened the shop door taking a quick look at everyone in the room she didnt see anyone out of place good grundal didnt know to look for her here she lifted her hood and stood up straight once again looking like a vibrant young woman instead of a hunched back granny the pleasant aroma of fresh baked sweets and exotic teas filled her nose her mouth watered reflexively as she identified the scent of cinnamon tarka cake the sweet and savory treat was her favorite and was her second favorite reason to visit the bacco hoggards bacco was a simple affair a few tables spread out to offer maximum privacy and the main counter where his treats were displayed kyra walked up to the counter and grabbed the piece of tarka cake that hoggard had waiting for her the soft and sweet cake melted in her mouth kyra slowly savored the treat before turning her attention to the waiting bacco owner do you have the merchandise asked hoggard kyra glanced down the counter no one was within hearing distance hoggard was confident that none of his patrons were spies or the sort to sell him out but kyra wasnt willing to trust that easily she only trusted a few people and none of them were here she slid a leather pouch across the counter release papers signed by the duke not authentic but only the duke himself would know the difference hoggard slid the pouch under the counter opened it and quickly inspected the forged document you truly have a gift kyra kyra smiled it was true she had a gift anything she saw she remembered and was able to replicate a signature a painting she could even duplicate a statue if necessary but she didnt like working with clay too time consuming and messy besides the real money was in forged documents she hardly ever got requests to do artwork thank you hoggard have you anything else you need im a little light on the cash this month grundal and his goons are looking for me normally this wouldnt be an issue but her last few bets had been fairly large too large considering the outcome and grundal sent the more dangerous goons out when the money got big hoggard shook his head youd be a rich woman if youd simply quit gambling havent i told you grundals races are fixed kyra shrugged i had a cant miss tip i thought id beat grundal at his own game hoggard scoffed grundal likes to do that he has one of his lowlevel grunts make the rounds hinting that the fix is in but for the right price hell cough up the secret sound familiar too familiar okay hoggie i vow to never gamble with grundal again now can you help me or what hoggard wasnt just kyras preferred middle man he was a fatherly figure that treated her with respect and over the years their comfort level with each other had grown to the point where teasing and nicknames were common the age difference was enough to remove any sexual issues she was just into her twenties while hoggard was at least double that kyra didnt have any daddy issues and hoggard had never acted inappropriate towards her not that she entirely trusted him he was after all a man and men by nature were not trust worthy hoggard stared at her for a moment as if he was debating something he then sighed perhaps but im not sure this job is a fit for you i dont think it requires any forging its more a mystery job kyra was intrigued a mystery was right up her alley hoggie my dear dont tease me you know i love a riddle what kind of mystery cant i solve im not saying youre not smart enough im saying you probably want to avoid this job it could be dangerous in a way youve never dealt with before what could be more dangerous than stealing orders from a military camp you had no problem sending me on that job i have faith that you can sneak into any place and i know once you look at something you can replicate it perfectly this isnt about your skills as a thief or your smarts come to the back and ill explain kyra was really curious now rarely did hoggard feel the need to leave the bar to discuss a job normally if he was comfortable with the crowd he simply talked in low tones there must be something special about this job for him to be so secretive thought kyra hoggard sat at his desk and waved at the open chair across from him kyra sat down and waited for an explanation hoggard said nothing are you going to tell me or are we just going to sit here and meditate asked kyra shush child im deciding whether or not to tell you hoggard paused damn it i never shouldve mentioned it i know youll just pester me until i tell you kyra gave a sly grin it was true she could be very persistent or annoying depending on whos point of view one was getting here is the job a client has an enemy who has been sabotaging his business interests and killing his allies hes had no luck finding out who is behind the attacks with the normal methods it is likely that some on the city guard are on the payroll of whoever is behind these attacks he needs to find out who it is kyra frowned her brow furrowed as she pondered the problem this doesnt sound like a job for a thief or a forgery artist nor does it sound incredibly dangerous i mean sure it is dangerous killers and all that but ive dealt with dangerous men before what makes this job any more dangerous than those ones what arent you telling me its more dangerous because of what i havent told you the client is prince valentine astor suddenly she understood prince valentine son of tristan astor ruler of draisha was the future king of draisha if he had an enemy powerful enough to take on the prince whoever was sent to find out the secret would be dealing with a highly motivated killer who would not want someone snooping around it also explained why it was strange that the normal methods hadnt worked prince astor had access to the city guards the royal palace guards and unlimited funds to hire investigators mercenaries or sellswords to find the information he was seeking that prince astor would come to hoggard with the job meant everyone else had failed how many people has the prince hired so far three that i know of admitted hoggard he has put enormous pressure on the city guards as well but they seem incapable of making any progress the city guard was corrupt everyone in draisha knew that however if the prince couldnt get info out of them then no one could his pockets were deep in coin and influence everything a corrupt city official desired how many of the men he hired are still alive hoggard scratched his chin nervously one well possibly one two were found in alleys with their throats cut the third is missing all were exsoldiers very capable warriors with experience in such matters if the sellswords who specialize in such work are getting killed why did the prince come to you you arent the one people come to for thugs or mercenaries you are the one they come to when they need to obtain things i said the same thing to the prince he said he wanted someone with a different approach to tackle his problem he wants someone who thinks outside the box someone with unorthodox methods who can hopefully find out the information he needs without dying first i told the prince i only know one person smart enough and crazy enough to take the job and what did lanister say when you offered him the job asked kyra jokingly ha lanister is certainly crazy enough to do it just show him enough coin and hed do just about anything no kyra you are the only one crazy enough and smart enough to figure this little mystery out but how to do it without getting your throat cut is what concerns me trust me hoggie im too fond of my neck to let it be slit but i will take the job under certain conditions kyra couldnt resist the challenge and the opportunity to establish a working relationship with a prince was a very special opportunity but she was no fool either if she did this job it would have to be done right and that meant bringing in protection protection she could fully trust im listening im going to have to hire some muscle for this job and it wont come cheap i get coin for that upfront i will also require triple my normal fee the prince was rich kyra figured he wouldnt balk at such a price done and done actually i already negotiated a price for you far above what you are asking figure this out for the prince and you can easily wipe out your gambling debts and then some do you want me to arrange the muscle i know a few sellswords who might be up to the task kyra shook her head no the type of men you could hire are not what i need i need someone that isnt from draisha i need someone who scares the type of men you know hoggards brow furrowed as he considered her words suddenly he sat up straight in his chair and pointed his finger at her accusingly kyra no you cant be serious this isnt protecting a caravan or rescuing a hostage from bandits you cant bring that savage into draisha said hoggard in protest kyra grinned shed known what her friend was going to say before the words ever left his mouth however despite his reputation kyra knew enough about the man in question to know he was someone she could trust to never betray her that was something no amount of money could buy from a normal sellsword the question wasnt if he was trust worthy the question was would she be able to convince him to take the job but that wasnt something she would share with hoggard he may be a savage but i trust him maybe a savage is just what we need to get this job done besides he can be civilized when necessary hoggard groaned bazur has destroyed the bar in pera more times than i can count i am tempted to sell that damn place just so i dont have to deal with him kyra laughed you old liar you like having a bar in the badlands it gives you access to all sorts of shifty characters you cant find in draisha besides if you didnt want your bar destroyed why did you put a bounty up in your bar for the first man to beat bazur up because that bounty has made me triple the coin from fools going out there to try their hands at beating up the halforc most of the time the fools just sit around drinking waiting for the opportunity to fight him but most never get the opportunity as he visits so rarely but i spend half my winnings fixing the place after bazur is done destroying it my math says you are still making a healthy profit off of him that is true conceded hoggard i would make a lot more but he barely ever visits pera and when he does he only stays long enough to trade have a few drinks and take on whichever challenger is waiting for him if hed be more reasonable i would make a fortune off him kyra shook her head bazur was rough and tough and enjoyed fighting but he had a particular code of honor he wouldnt become hoggards prize fighter or for anyone else he was too independent for that youll never get him to agree to being your fighter just be happy he likes your bar its the honey mead orcs drink mead orcs and elves love the stuff thank goodness the bartender keeps bees getting the really good stuff in from irri is challenging hoggard pulled a purse out of his desk and threw it to kyra the prince wants you to start right away there is more than enough coin to hire bazur have you taken your cut yet asked kyra as she jiggled the purse it was heavy with coin no im not taking a cut on this job kyra raised an eyebrow that was very unlike hoggard dont give me that look the prince is going to be king one day and he will owe me a favor that is worth far more than ten percent of your earnings kyra smiled she could only imagine what kind of crooked deal hoggard was cooking up that required a favor from a king true enough arrange a meeting with the prince im going to need more details if i am going to sort this out good luck kyra dont get yourself killed and for love of the gods dont let bazur destroy the city kyra shrugged as she lifted her hood over her head and resumed her disguise as an old woman i make no promises she said in her fake granny voice behind her she could hear hoggard groaning and cursing her name as she walked out the door,1

eight years ago our states humanity came under attack vote tuesday  to restore wisconsin to a place where elected leaders have the strength to protect our schools environment and kindness no matter how big of a campaign donation offered to promote sharing until sunday  worth of good spices amp kindness just  all of us who grew up in the state of wisconsin grew up in a place we could be proud of a strong economy based on quality public education a  university system that rivaled the nations best a pro environmental voice heard around the country and around the world and behind all this was the intentional kindness and caring of our states people the wisconsin of our youth was a gift given to us by all those who came before that we were obliged to pass on to all those who came after then came the  election the republican party chose wisconsin to be the test ground for all that unlimited political spending could do the very same forces that paved the way for what happened nationally in  first tested it all out here before the president grabbed the reins it was our governor testing out the attack on education selling out the environment and even testing the staged racism towards native americans we must address what is happening in the white house but just removing the tip of the iceberg changes pretty much nothing for real change we must also address the source and thats up to us the wisconsin voters penzeys is a wisconsin business and a national business too as a yearold just starting penzeys i thought it would have been easier if my grandparents had chosen a city a little more in the spotlight today im convinced if we had been planted anywhere else finding our way to the business weve become would have only been harder human kindness really is universal but growing up in my parents spice store on rd amp galena through our customers i was given the chance to witness a kindness that was also intentional through them i learned when you take the time to care about others the world becomes a better place thats a very milwaukee and very wisconsin idea the fact is wisconsin wasnt randomly chosen out of a hat as the test ground for what unlimited political spending could do we were chosen because of our history wisconsin created the republican party as a force against slavery milwaukee has long embraced compassionate capitalism if unlimited media buys and the anger of the right wing echo machine could unravel a century of wisconsin support for education and the environment here it could be repeated everywhere so they set off to vilify teachers and turn suburban voters against public education for a  property tax cut then they went after our states proud history of environmental protection for nothing more than their own campaign contributions at first our desire to see goodness in everyone had us thinking this was just a brandnew governor in over his head but as time went on and this all only escalated we saw how incredibly organized the money behind all this was in time we came to realize there was no goodness here at all only the stripmining of the public good to give more to those who were already the wealthiest of the wealthy there was the thought in  that our now president with his lack of conscience and willingness to sell out all that is good for his own advancement somehow surprised the republican party we here in wisconsin have learned the hard way these are the very leadership values theyve built their new party model around january   the day after the inauguration the day of the first womans march many nationally were pleasantly surprised that a wisconsin spice business had a symbol that so closely embraced the feelings that had them marching in our kind heart pin and in the words kindness cant sit down simply because anger has stood up testing grounds work both ways while wisconsin was the trial run for what the republicans have now become nationally we were pushing back against their efforts time and again we found when they go after education minority rights the environment healthcare for those in need or even now in their taking of children from parents legally seeking asylum what they are really trying to do is erode our common decency and our shared humanity for them to win they need us to stop caring in studying their blueprints what weve found is that their death star has no defense against human compassion our kindness is our strength please use this knowledge any way you can this tuesday in wisconsin its this message of kindness we must share and continue to share across the nation through november  and onward to november   in wisconsin it is time for someone with the strength and courage to stand up to outside money no matter the size of the check to be voted the opportunity to govern thankfully there are many with this strength and courage on tuesdays ballot if you are in wisconsin and would like to know more about how and where to vote please click this link,1

a new book on hannah arendt will be published in december by cambridge university press read an interview below with the author david arndt cup let us start with a simple question what is your book about da it is on the question what is politics what defines the political sphere how is politics different from economics law morality religion or warfare cup why do these questions matter da they underlie questions of democracy what view of politics is conducive to a strong and just democracy and what views of politics tend to weaken and corrupt democracy cup and your answer is da there are several views that are weakening and corrupting american democracy right now politics is viewed in economic terms in technocratic terms in religious terms etc but the most common view today understands politics as a war for power the rhetoric of politics as warfare permeates american political discourse cup what is wrong with seeing politics as war da when we see political opponents as enemies we tend to make words into weapons our discourse devolves into spin distortions propaganda disinformation and lies this is selfdefeating for a democracy it weakens our ability to act effectively and to move towards justice justice only comes through truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth cup but who possesses the whole truth da no one nobody has a monopoly on truth arendt said this explicitly we are in touch with reality to the extent that we can see it from many points of view and we can do this only by deliberating with others trying to persuade them and being open to their persuasion cup there are many political theorists why turn to arendt da arendt said something striking western philosophers have never had a pure concept of the political the metaphysical assumptions implicit in their basic questions led them astray her aim was to look at politics so to speak with eyes unclouded by philosophy cup how did she do that da i think she approached political theory in a new way her approach had three aims  to critically dismantle the concepts we have inherited from philosophical traditions  to retrieve the authentic insights of people who have experienced political life firsthand  to sense what has been obscured by inherited concepts and to rework those concepts in order to bring to light what has been beyond the reach of conceptual thought cup could you give me a concrete example of her approach da sure her approach is clear in her book on the american revolution arendt thought that the force of circumstances led the american colonists to invent new practices of selfgovernment and that the experience of selfgovernment led them to authentic insights into the realities of political life but their innovations in practice were not matched by innovations in theory they interpreted their experiences in inherited concepts instead of rethinking inherited concepts in light of their own experiences so there is a gap in their discourse between explicit theory and implicit insight in her reading of the declaration of independence arendt tried to show the limits of the concepts inherited from the british tradition but she also tried to locate the authentic insights implicit in the text and to translate those insights into the less direct but more articulate language of political thought she drew on the revolutionaries in her effort to rethink the nature of power authority force violence law contract government and freedom cup is her reading of the declaration of independence still relevant today da yes butsorrythat question is too big to answer in a few words im afraid you will have to read the book cup fair enough any last words da i have worked with many academic presses and cambridge has beenbeyond comparisonthe most responsive astute and professional i am especially grateful to my editor hilary gaskin who helped make the book better in many ways heartfelt thanks to her for everything,1

heres how we make sure bardstown rd survives covid bardstown rd is the heart of the highlands and will only reach its maximum potential by burying the power lines allowing us to invest in a world class tree canopy this will be especially critical as we deal with the longterm implications of covid rebuilding our local economy and addressing climate change without a vibrant bardstown rd the highlands will suffer we were already seeing hints of a decline and now  with the challenges facing small businesses moving forward it is critical that we create an environment that gives them the best chance at success this long overdue investment will pay for itself many times over by dramatically improving the quality of the street while increasing property values and thus taxes it will create an even more vibrant street that attracts hundreds of thousands more visitors a year who will increase sales at existing businesses and also incentivize new businesses to move to the corridor the traffic and lighting study is a much needed move in the right direction but with the changed economic environment these updates are not enough to alter the longterm trajectory of the street or to ensure our neighborhood continues to thrive for the foreseeable future while bardstown road was once the only cool kid on the block we now face competition from many other areas of town in attracting visitors and businesses despite bardstown rd being one of the most valuable corridors in the state generating many millions of dollars in tax revenue yearly and clearly in need of investment many will ask how can we afford this project phase  would run from taylorsville rd to broadway approximately  miles encompassing  properties assessed at nearly  million hundreds of small businesses occupy those properties including at least  restaurants that avg over a million dollars in sales each those restaurants alone yearly generate over  million in sales taxes hundreds of thousands in occupational taxes and millions in other feestaxes a ten percent increase in property values of just the adjacent properties an amount that understates the potential increase in value that will be provided by this investment in the streetscape alone would generate several hundred thousands more a year in just property taxes additionally with these improvements i estimate at least  additional visits to the street yearly generating  million in additional business sales and hundreds of thousands in additional tax revenue including sales taxes occupational taxes and parking meter revenue all added to louisivilles coffers how does one even begin to quantify the value of having a world class street to the tens of thousands of people who live adjacent to it and to the hundreds of thousands of people who use it work along it daily and who will have a much better experience be it the reduced temperatures and shade in summer or the esthetic improvement in winter there is no doubt this is a dramatic improvement in the quality of the built environment while that value will not be measured in cash there is no doubt that our community will value it tremendously louisville gas and electric company has publicly estimated the cost of burying the power lines at roughly  per mile lets conservatively double that cost and add another  million to plant and maintain around one thousand  inch trees the  million invested in this project will be almost doubled in just the increased property values and this investment will generate millions of dollars a year in additional taxes dramatically improve the experience of all those who use the street attract many more visitors and ensure the success of the bardstown rd and the highlands for generations the most valuable investments we can make as a community are ones that improve the quality of life for existing citizens and support existing businesses keep in mind we spend exponentially more than the cost of this project on convention centers luxury hotels sports stadiums and widening our interstates all without even batting an eye we have all enjoyed the cleaner air and lack of traffic during the shutdown and now that we understand more clearly the value of curbing vehicle and industrial pollution we can never go back we must recognize the world and city have changed and prioritizing investments that improve public health and create more livable and enjoyable spaces must be our communitys priority moving forward please share so more people can see for themselves the beautiful street we are missing out on thanks dan democratdancom paid for by daniel borsch for metro council,1

share this article with anyone who says unions were good once but we dont need them any longer how labor unions are addressing automation the first wave of computerized automation caught trade unions flatfooted already reeling from the reaganera attacks on labor union leadership failed completely to come up with a coherent response to the automation of manufacturing industries with a second wave of automation upon us unions representing service workers and truck drivers are floating more nuanced responses to automation calling for worker input into how their jobs are automated it is exemplary of the new labor consciousness of protecting workers interests in an era of technological abundance  ensuring that as work disappears into automated systems workers themselves share in the dividends of that automation unite here is following a similar path mr singh listed the unions goals for marriott contracts we want to talk about how technology can assist the work we perform and ease the rigors of our work how our members are trained what happens to workers who would otherwise be tagged as redundant how our members are repositioned to succeed or hired into other workplaces in june the union managed for the first time to include protections from technological change in its contracts covering workers at the las vegas properties of mgm resorts and caesars entertainment workers will be trained to do jobs created or modified by new technology allowing them to share in the productivity gains the contracts also provide for the company to try to find jobs for displaced workers but the unions key achievement was to get  days warning of technological deployments they have to let us know and show us the prototypes and must negotiate with us mr taylor said at the end of the day they can move forward but this gives us time to understand the effects,1
