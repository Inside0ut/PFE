"There was this little boy in Africa, he was only 1 year old and he died of hunger.",1
It breaks my heart,1
"You know a lot of children in this world go through hardships, and your destiny is determined on where you are born?",1
"Yeah, so the chances of being born in the United States are very low, but you and I could have been born in a third world country where children are exploited",1
There are several children around us who are below poverty line and needed a helping hand.,1
Millians of syrian children have grown up facing the threat of daily violence,1
In 2018 1000 children were killed in violence,1
IN 2018 alone 1000 children were reportedly killed or injured in violence.,1
Most of these children have grown up facing the threat of daily violence.,1
ESpecially since children are being specifically targeted for rape and torture.,1
Some are being sold to ISIS,1
"True, but nothing and something are pretty different things.",1
Especially to a kid that is facing a future as a sex slave.,1
"For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.",1
"In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.",1
"Yes, Hope you aware whats going with child who died from hunger",1
"For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.",1
"In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.",1
"So many poor kids around the world don't have food, clothing, shelter.",1
"I am supposed to ask you if you care about people being killed in Syria and things like that, I don't want to cause you any emotional discomfort by talking about suffering people.",1
"I think the refugee crisis is crazy, I am not sure what I would do if I was raising my kids in Syria.",1
If anyone could have fun in those spots it's kids though.,1
I read an article yesterday that said 1000 children were saved from hunger shelters just by donations from online workers.,1
"There is  a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.",1
"For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.",1
"In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.",1
Its a lot of children that are starving and need our help.,1
"For example, millions of children in Syria grow up facing the daily threat of violence.",1
It is really difficult having to grow up having to worry about basic needs.,1
I'm glad you are able to look for what to be grateful for.,1
I guess there are more people than we know who grew up with no worries.,1
Many children in these countries live in a war zone.,1
"Places like Syria and parts of Nigeria are so dangerous that children do not have the chance of a happy, healthy life.",1
Especially for the children in war zones where they are dying every day because they cannot get enough medical care.,1
I am sure that you have seen pictures of the bombing in Syria and the murder of innocent children in places like Nigeria and Somallis where terrorists are bombing their villages.,1
These children have no hope except for people like you and I.,1
"Everyday 16,000 children die before their 5th birthday, 1 out of 80 flee the country and risk everything, and 1 out of 6 kids aren't enrolled in a school or getting education that they need",1
"Did you know in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1,000 children were killed or injured seriously by violence in Syria?",1
What do you think of the kids who weren't born as lucky?,1
Who have to worry about having enough to eat to even be full?,1
With no place to live?,1
Not everyone has it so it's good that you appreciate it,1
my parents were always in a good situation to be able to raise me well.,1
but there are a lot of kids in the world who arent so fortunate',1
1000 children were killed or injured and the donations can address these problems.,1
I have a son and I can't imagine seeing him hungry or in pain or afraid of being killed.,1
i want to help all the children in the world,1
Children everyday are dying of hunger and violence so it's really important to donate to help them.,1
do you know many kids in the world are suffering,1
But think of all of the poor children.,1
Have you no empathy?,1
There are poor children all over the world who don't have enough food to eat and Save the Children goes out to help them.,1
I don't waant anyone to go hungry.,1
"Yes, and our children need help they are our future without them we are nothing.",1
The amount of suffering that children around the world face is terrible.,1
"For example, in the first two months of 2018, a thousand children in Syria were injured in the violence there.",1
Anything you can add to the donation will go directly to helping them.,1
"In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.",1
there are many children who suffer today in the world for bread,1
"As you know, unfortunately, everyone wasn't born into the same opportunities.",1
"Some are born extremely well off, some are born with some opportunities and some are born completely destitute.",1
I'd like to talk about children who weren't born with the same as opportunities.,1
Particularly children who go hungry everyday and have no place to live.,1
How does that make you feel?,1
I felt safe and secure in my home.,1
That is absolutely wonderful.,1
I feel many people take that for granted.,1
Not having to worry about those things while growing up.,1
It would be great if we could work together to assure that everyone have at least those basic necessities met.,1
I feel heartbroken for some of these kids.,1
It just sucks that millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.,1
"In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.",1
This makes me angry and was wondering if it did the same for you?,1
"Well one statistic that in 2018 alone over 1,000 children were killed or injured in Syria.",1
This charity's goal is to help them out.,1
The stand of living in developing nations does not compare with our own.,1
Most of these nations are war zones and children face this daily threat of violence against them.,1
Everybody deserves the option to be happy.,1
We all should have equal opportunity to be happy and succeed in life.,1
It is a shame many children die of hunger everyday while some people spend money on stuff they do not need,1
We have many children who starve and die of hunger.,1
You donation will stop this from happening and possible save a child's life,1
We have not received much support for these children.,1
"For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.",1
"In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.",1
Your donation could possible go to this problem and help many young children,1
Children in underdeveloped countries do not have the support that other kids have and I just want to give them a chance to improve their lives.,1
There was a child who died of hunger and I think my donation will help other children.,1
"I just read that The United Nations estimated last year 25,000 people still die of hunger daily.",1
That means more than 9.1 million people die of hunger every year.,1
It makes me angry to know of so many children in danger in the world.,1
Especially if that story of a child who died makes you angry like me.,1
It's so easy we won't even miss it.,1
Think of the poor kids in Syria who could get so much for the price of a coffee in Chicago.,1
"But you have a full time job, food, shelter and I'm sure you have family and friends.",1
"These kids families were murdered and they live in rubble that used to be their home, nobody to care for them and they only eat what they can find off the street from the dead.",1
If they eat at all,1
"For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.",1
"In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.",1
Can you imagine living in extreme violence?,1
"Did you know that in Syria, 1,000 children were killed in just the first two months of 2018?",1
I understand but these children have even less than us.,1
I'm sorry to hear you are having a hard time.,1
"I have hard circumstances too, but I know there are millions of children that are worse off.",1
"For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.",1
"In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.",1
"For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.",1
"In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.",1
"Bruce was born to a single mother who was only 14 at the time he came into this world , the girls mother and father were ashamed of her pregnancy and kicked out of the house.",1
The founder of save the children heard about the family and learned of Bruces story .,1
He came to meet Bruce .,1
Bruce went own to join the save the children foundation after he completed college and is helping save children today.,1
The owner got involved in Bruces life and sav the children went to work and provide food and cloths and school needs for Bruce .,1
Yes he is a force for good and was saved out of tragedy.,1
"I worry about those kids too, so I understand.",1
"It's a shame what's going on, I hope the problem gets rectified soon.",1
"For example,millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.",1
"In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.",1
I cannot even begin to imagine that and clean water should be a basic right to every child on this planet.,1
I'd like to talk to you about children who are less fortunate.,1
Children who suffer from hunger would greatly appreciate a donation,1
"Another example is in Syria over 1,000 children have already been killed this year!",1
Don't you think every child deserves a long and happy life?,1
Think about how much more those poor kids in developing countries needs the money.,1
By not donating this tiny amount you're directly allowing children to sufer.,1
Of course you work for everything you own.,1
By helping Save the Children you will directly be allowing a child to grow up and work for things him or herself rather than living in poverty and possibly not even making it out of childhood.,1
Think about all the stories you hear in the news and on social media about children that need help or have been taken advantage of.,1
"But one thing is for certain, you will feel good about your donation!",1
We should be mad about what is happening to them,1
There are children dying in Syria who can benefit from the donation.,1
Think about all the children in war torn areas and all of the physical and emotional support they need.,1
Its devistating,1
I was just thinking about all the kids going back to school and saw a story about places to drop off school supplies for kids in need,1
Those kids suffer quite a lot and dont really have anyone to help them.,1
"I give a lot of money to the children in need, with pain everywhere they are",1
"Did you know over 1,000 children were killed in Syria in just the first 2 months of 2018.",1
Actually it breaks my heart to see children in pain.,1
There are many kids that still needs help in other parts of the world,1
There are many that lives in war zones with no access to food.,1
I saw a kid die in my hands.,1
Its a shame.,1
Can you think about someone else but yourself?,1
How do you feel about those who were unluckily born to poor circumstances?,1
"It will be difficult, but we are focused in reuniting the children with their family.",1
The separation should never have happened.,1
"that good You knew that for every minute that passes, a child under the age of 5 dies as a result of the war in the Middle East",1
Yes in developing countries lack of educations for childrens in war zone and even if you taken in syria the millions of peoples meet their daily days by violance but we have a great days so we make that happier and healthier,1
Have you heard of children getting separated from their family at the US-Mexico border?,1
Children shouldn't be separated from their families.,1
"It is very heartbreaking to hear, and I'm glad Save the Children stepped in.",1
Just found out there are tons of sick kids right now over seas that need help,1
It is our moral responsibility to help feed the hungry.,1
"We are so lucky to live in a country where there is help available to us such as Medicaid, food banks and other organizations to help us.",1
"It is so unfair that any person in any country can go hungry,",1
I hope that each of us can make a conscious decision to start donating some of our paychecks each week to help children and families around the world.,1
Yes it is truly up to us to help the millions of children in Syria who have grown up only knowing violence,1
Millions of syrian children have grown up facing daily threats of violence this will be a step towards saving children world wide!,1
there are so many wars and so many natural disasters,1
I know the commercials are heart wrenching...seeing all those children suffer and hurting.,1
It breaks my heart.,1
I have a little girl and it only makes me want to do more and more for her.,1
"Oh, I know children did not ask to grow up in these coditions adults have let them down in so many ways",1
So many children die every day due to starvation and acts of violence in these developing countries.,1
These children are not given the same opportunity at education as you and I.,1
Millions of children in the U.S. and around the world still aren't getting what they deserve.,1
"Especially childrens charities, children are so innocent and deserve the best chance at life.",1
"True, but there are so many innocent little children who don't have access to food or clean water, not to mention basic health needs.",1
We are lucky to have help if needed they have no one to turn to.,1
A lot of these children don't have people like you in their community.,1
"There is a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.",1
"For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.",1
"In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.",1
Your small donation can address such problems.,1
Many of these children don't have the same opportunities as others and live in very difficult conditions.,1
"I chose those words because across the United States, one in five children grows up in poverty and, of the counties with the highest poverty rates, 90% are rural.",1
"Because of circumstances beyond their control, millions of kids never reach their full potential.",1
I wish all kids could have that kind of opportunity.,1
"It can help a lot of kids - from the hungry in the US, to the children literally being killed in war zones.",1
It would help so much.,1
Some people are born really well-off.,1
"Some are born not well-off, but they can reasonably expect enough food to eat and a place to live.",1
And there are some who are born so destitute that they can go for several weeks in hunger and/or not have a safe place to live or sleep.,1
How does that make you feel?,1
I have a friend of mine in another country who lost a child today to hunger,1
It's really sad we have the money to just splurge on stuff in our normal every day lives but we can't spend just a few bucks a month or year for the children!,1
some people donate whole their life and time.,1
"In the first two months of 2018, around 1,000 children were killed or injured due to violence there.",1
"Yes without this charity young kids and their families could die of hunger, dehydration, or disease",1
They save children from horrible fates like starvation.,1
No child should ever lose their life for lack of food.,1
"For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.",1
"In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence",1
"Well, lets get specific.",1
Have you seen the kids in Syria?,1
Those kids are growing up in tents and being bombed every day.,1
Still it isn't enough.,1
The kids there are struggling.,1
"True, but there - the kids are lucky to get a meal a day.",1
Save the children helps with that.,1
I am so livid I just can't stand it right now.,1
Parts of this world are so dark...,1
how can we sit here and do nothing?,1
These poor suffering children!,1
Did you know that 5.6 million children die each year due to treatable AND preventable diseases?,1
maybe there are children who may die without this money,1
Being able to support a child is a moral thing to do.,1
These children die from hunger daily.,1
Your donation is making an impact on the children and their families,1
It is I have personally been involved with this charity after finding out that millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.,1
"In the first two months of 2018 alone 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence",1
For example Syrian kids have died in thousands just in 2018 and Save the children is trying to help as much as they can,1
I remmember a case of a children that lost his oparents at war in Syria.,1
And think of all the kiddies you will be helping!,1
Yes children really need your help.,1
There are children in war zones and under developed countries just begging for help.,1
They help children in war zones.,1
These kids really deserve it :),1
"In comparison, these children need more help than you or I. Fortunate is perspective based but from my perspective, these kids are far less fortunate than I.",1
I loved that they set up shelters that were child friendly because t's so hard for kids to be away from home like that,1
It just so sad to see children from developing countries die from easily preventable deseases,1
million of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.,1
You said you have a kid.,1
Imagine your precious child going through it every day.,1
waking up every day being afraid of getting killed,1
I usually like to focus on charities that help children since I think they are most vulnerable,1
I have a soft heart for children,1
It makes my heart happy how people care about children.,1
It will guarantee many children's safety,1
Children in other countries don't have the advantages that we do such as access to the internet,1
Nearly 5.6 million children die each year due to preventable causes.,1
You have to think about how helpless children can be.,1
"In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.",1
If we had more help by people like you.,1
These things could be avoided.,1
"The children we help are in desperate need, however.",1
"Did you know that in the first two months of 2018, over 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in Syria alone?",1
Kids are dying from hunger every minute.,1
Don't you want to help stop that?,1
There isn't a lot of support for children in developing countries.,1
This should make you mad and want to help.,1
It's really really sad what's going on over there.,1
Those commercials make me so sad!,1
"In the U.S. and around the world, Save the Children does whatever it takes ??Â¸??Â¸ every day and in times of crisis ??Â¸??Â¸ to ensure children grow up healthy, learning and safe.",1
"Learn about the places we work, the challenges children face and the results we achieve, thanks to supporters like me and you.",1
"That is great to hear, but sadly there is not much that that organization can do, as a lot of children in poor countries don't even get the chance to live past the 15 years of age",1
"I could try to persuade you more, but it seems your mind is fairly set in place.",1
"Just remember it's not about doing better for ourselves, it's for the next generations that follow us.",1
But am upset about something I just learned,1
"In the first two months of 2018 alone over 1,000 Syrian children died or were injured due to intensifying violence and war.",1
This makes me so anger and sad!,1
That innocent children are being harmed over something they have no control over!,1
I fell so bad about it also.,1
I hope someday these children will be free from all of this violence,1
"In developing countries like Syria, millions of children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.",1
I remember seeing ads on the television about it and it breaks my hear to see children so sad and suffering in conditions that they live in.,1
"I haven't personally witnessed experiences first hand, however, it comes down to basic human needs.",1
Vulnerable children in poverty.,1
Denied an education.,1
Forced to flee violence.,1
"Orphaned, abused, abandoned.",1
Children with no reason to smile.,1
No hope for the future.,1
Not as much as the starving children in Syria who don't even have a phone/desktop to do this hit.,1
"I hope you feel guilty for not helping the kids now, because this is just your time.",1
It takes so little money to help feed a starving child.,1
"If you pledge to contribute the reward from this task, that will feed a starving child for a full day!",1
Isn't that amazing?,1
Promoting the right's of children that are suffering.,1
It makes me so sad to know that some children are having a hard time even finding clean water to drink.,1
"Those are things I've just always had, so sometimes I feel guilty that I haven't tried to do more to help others.",1
It is really so heartbreaking when you see all of these kids not having enough to eat.,1
It really breaks the heart.,1
They are so little.,1
I would hate to think a child would die with no food when I could ask people to help.,1
"I could not imagine having to watch any child suffer, much less my own.",1
Millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.,1
"In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.",1
"In the first two months of this year, 1000 kids were killed in Syria.",1
Crazy.,1
There are so many relevent issues going on in the world right now its hard to focus on just one.,1
"There are children out there now without access to housing, clean water, education, and many other things we often take for granted.",1
"I understand that everyone cannot commit to making a serious donation, but when we think about children suffering, we have a moral imperative to act in their defense.",1
"OK, I will not force you to make a decision you don't want to.",1
I will just ask you to consider how you would feel if your child was danger like many children are.,1
Right now there are many children who are suffering in the world and they need our help.,1
"Children around the world are threaten by war such as in Syria, by hunger and disease such as in Africa.",1
I feel the same way as you do.,1
It broke my heart to see that famous photograph of a child with a vulture sitting next to it.,1
It made me both angry and sad.,1
"I have always believed that everyone can make a difference, but what was I doing?",1
"Did you know that 16,000 children under the age of 5 die each day?",1
"Most of them die from preventable diseases, too!",1
That horrifies me!,1
"For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.",1
"In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.",1
"For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.",1
"In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.",1
The best part is knowing that you can help make a change in a person's life who is currently unable to financially,1
"So many kids out there need a home, after all!",1
"There are so many issues today with children, all over the world!",1
"For instance, did you know that in the first two months of 2018 alone, over 1k children were killed or injured in intensifying violence?",1
I have seen kids dying of hunger in those countries at war.It breaks my heart,1
They are children.They did not ask fot this.,1
Many children in war zones are struggling,1
Giving to Save the Children is one of the world's best investments.,1
Changing children's lives now.,1
Transforming the future we all share.,1
Yes they are everywhere.,1
I saw a kid die in my hands once.,1
It was horrible,1
"Did you know that in the first 2 months of 2018 alone, 1000 kids were killed or injured in the violence happening in Syria?",1
Your donation will help those kids so much.,1
You should feel so good donating,1
In the first 2 months of 2018 alone 1000 children were reportedly killed or injured.,1
Save the Children is an amazing organization.,1
The children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.,1
Syrian children have grown up facing daily threat of violence.,1
It is so sad that children have to been in the middle of all the hate in the world today.,1
It breaks my heart to see and hear of how bad children have to live and what they go thru each and every single day.,1
this is the most important thing for them and to make some happy ones,1
I know I would feel horrible if any kids in my family/extended family were suffering.,1
It breaks my heart to know that while I have so much freedom there are kids that look at a simple meal as a lifesaving chance.,1
"If only they had parental support, but in war-torn countries like Syria their parents are being killed in wars or are fighting for their country, they have no help and that's why they need your support, please find it in your heart to just give a little bit tonight, that's all I'm asking.",1
Children are being hit with bombs they are looking for help in war zones,1
"Also, when a child is sick, they sometimes don't have the funds for proper healthcare, so unfortunately they die.",1
It's really terrible.,1
"So many children die from hunger, and it's not fair.",1
It's so sad that so many children are dying in developing countries and war zones.,1
It makes me furious.,1
"I head of one child who was in the middle of a war-torn city in Syria, who was cut off from food and water, and died.",1
"In countries like Syria, 1000 children have been killed during the civil war.",1
Isn't that insane?,1
"Adults often can't fend for themselves when there's a crisis, but children are especially vulnerable.",1
Every day I watch the news and hear about victims all over the world and feel kind of powerless.,1
"These children have been victims of war, famine, and poverty.",1
You would be shocked at how many children live in poverty here in the United States.,1
"Can you imagine someone taking your small child away from you and not knowing where they are going, who is going to be caring for them, or if you will ever be able to see them again?",1
"As a mother, that thought is horrifying.",1
I saw a children die once,1
He was hungry with no food.,1
I was serving in Afghanistan,1
why did not you help him?,1
I tried to give him my food but it was too late,1
More than thousands children have died of hunger in Syria this year.,1
We must do something about it,1
They are the future you know...,1
alot of the children are in war zones and facing daily threats of violence.,1
Some of them are basically naked and have nothing.,1
Others have no shoes.,1
"It's really sad, but that's why there are programs out here like us to step in and provide help.",1
"Across the United States, more than 14 million children, or 1 in 5, grow up in poverty.",1
I believe every child deserves the chance to have food in their bellies and an education to be able to help others when they get to adulthood.,1
"Mim, in Bangladesh is 7 years old, and wants to become a teacher.",1
"It could go towards her education, because in her country the average girl only stays in school until 10 years old.",1
"But more likely, it will be going towards meals or daily living expenses, with the average parent from her country only earning $3 a day.",1
"One more meal or a pair of shoes will be one less thing that Mim, and her parents need to worry about.",1
"Bangladesh has been one of the largest parts of that Rohingya refugee exodus from Myanmar that I mentioned before and have been struggling themselves taking on more than 655,000 extra people.",1
This has caused further hardship on an already hardened country.,1
"There is a lack of support for children in developing countries, especially in war zones.",1
"For instance, millions of Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.",1
"In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.",1
The war torn area is just one of many examples of places where kids need support.,1
"Honestly, if you think you're broke you should see how poor these children are.",1
"You know they're worse off than you, right?",1
They have even less than your daughter has.,1
Think about those poor kids.,1
"These children are being used in horrific ways, the food and supplies that are supposed to be going to them are being stolen and we are trying to gather money to ensure the supplies get to these children who really need these supplies and help. With a donation today, not only will we be able to ensure the supply lines safely reach villages, but doctors will also go and help the children with medical care they desperately need.",1
"Look, already in 2018 alone, 1,000 children have been reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.",1
They need your help.,1
They need your donation more than you do honestly.,1
What is $2 to you when that money can literally save lives over there?,1
Millions of children in Syria alone face the daily threat of violence.,1
"For example,Syrian children have grown up facing the daily threat of violence.",1
"In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence.",1
"It says on their site that in the first two months of this year alone, 1000 children were killed or injured there",1
I can't imagine what that's like for the parents.,1

"i was disturbed to learn today that justin trudeau is political office has ordered nonpartisan government officials to do political damage control
according to media reports the prime minister is office ordered officials from global affairs canada to put pressure on former diplomat david mulroney who is now a teacher and researcher at the munk school at the university of toronto to have his public remarks on the trudeau government approved this pressure would be due to the electoral environment so that mr mulroney had to be very very careful
this is totally inappropriate and a blatant attempt by justin trudeau to muzzle a highly respected former career diplomat trudeau has demonstrated his tendency to silence those who speak freely
justin trudeau once said he admires china is grassroots dictatorship but that is not how it works in canada
it also raises questions about whether the prime minister is office has ordered government officials to speak with former ambassador to china and former trudeau cabinet minister john mccallum mccallum has made a number of inappropriate statements over the past year including about canada is extradition process and its encouragement of chinese foreign interference in the upcoming federal election
as mr mulroney said deterring citizens with foreign relations expertise from speaking freely is a fundamentally undemocratic concept i completely agree justin trudeau must be held accountable for the many occasions when he exploits canada is nonpartisan public service to serve his own political interests
justin trudeau had promised to do politics differently but it is clear that he is not what he announced",1

animal rights and animal welfare – know the difference there is a big difference between animal rights and animal welfare and it needs to be clarified the american veterinary medical association has taken a formal position defining the difference between the two labels animal rights vs animal welfare in their detailed policy on animal welfare and animal rights they state that they cannot endorse the views of animal rights groups here’s a quote from their policy “animal  rights is a philosophical view and personal value characterized by statements by various animal rights groups animal welfare and animal rights are not synonymous terms the avma wholeheartedly endorses and adopts promotion of animal welfare as official policy however the avma cannot endorse the philosophical views and personal values of animal rights advocates when they are incompatible with the responsible use of animals for human purposes such as food fiber and research conducted for the benefit of both humans and animals” let’s take a closer look at the fundamental differences between animal welfare and the animal rights philosophy animal welfare – animal welfare includes all animals whether used for food companionship or sport it is based on a principle of ownership of animals it reflects a common sense approach that animals should be treated well and that animal cruelty is wrong animal welfare standards and guidelines for animal use and management are based on sound veterinary and animal husbandry experience research and practices the avma views animal welfare as a “…human responsibility that encompasses all aspects of animal wellbeing including proper housing management nutrition disease prevention and treatment responsible care humane handling and when necessary humane euthanasia” it also means animals that provide for human needs experience no unnecessary suffering animal rights  animal rights advocates and their groups believe in the ideology that there is no distinction between animals and humans they view animal ownership as exploitation and slavery the true goal of animal rights groups is to work for legislation and humane care only until all animals are no longer owned or utilized by human beings the ncraoa north carolina responsible animal owners alliance has described what animal rights groups are all about and their activities “animal rights groups exploit our love of animals to work for various types of restrictive legislation limit laws breed specific legislation mandatory spayneuter as well as laws that are steps toward changing the legal status of animals as property” and “the animal rights movement is about control not animal welfare supporting legislation based on emotion and philosophical interpretation provides a platform in our legal system for incremental increases toward animal status changes” lately we have been accused of being against the proper care and husbandry of animals this has happened because over the years we have been working hard to shed light on extremist animal rights groups we have exposed their activities and their agenda they are afraid the public will finally realize they are staging a dramatic impact on the rights and way of life of all americans since they are feeling threatened and are afraid of exposure they have fought back against us they have called us the “bad guy” and much worse while doing this they have conveniently blurred the definition of animal rights which both confuses and misleads the public they accuse us of being “antianimal” and “against animals” we have even been accused of “hating horses” and benefiting from killing them these accusations are not even close to the truth they are outright fabrications folks who are affiliated and work with protect the harvest have pets and a number also have horses and livestock we care about animals we care about their health and wellbeing we practice and support animal welfare while these outright falsehoods that have been launched against us create more work and some challenges for us it also shows that we are making progress in short we support animal welfare but we are against animal rights taking a stand against animal rights in no way means that we do not care about animals or their welfare we do care or we would not be investing time money and a whole lot of effort in educating the public about protecting our rights animal ownership agriculture and our heritage to stay informed sign up for our newsletter httpprotecttheharvestcomnewslettersignup,1

"today i was disturbed to read that justin trudeau is political office has ordered canada is nonpartisan public service to do his political damage control
according to media reports officials from global affairs canada were ordered by the prime minister is office to pressure former career diplomat david mulroney who is now an academic and fellow at the university of toronto munk school to clear his public statements with the trudeau government the reason for this pressure was reportedly due to the election environment and therefore mr mulroney had to be very very careful
this exchange is highly inappropriate and represents a blatant attempt by justin trudeau to muzzle a respected former career diplomat trudeau has shown a clear pattern of silencing those who speak out
justin trudeau once said he admires china is basic dictatorship but this is not how things are done in canada
this also raises questions as to whether or not officials have been ordered by trudeau is pmo to speak with former ambassador to china and former trudeau cabinet minister john mccallum mr mccallum has made a number of inappropriate statements over the past year including his comments on canada is extradition process and his encouragement of chinese foreign interference in the upcoming election
as mr mulroney stated discouraging private citizens with expertise in foreign relations from speaking freely is fundamentally an undemocratic idea i could not agree more justin trudeau must answer for the many times he has exploited canada is nonpartisan public service for his own political purpose
justin trudeau promised to do politics differently but clearly he is not as advertised",1

at the end of the revolutionary war for independence lafayette said humanity has won its battle liberty now has a country but where did it go who squandered it are we not intelligent enough to see it are we not the people to restore it to full glory if john adams were here today he would say the prospect is chilling on every side gloomy dark melancholy and dispiriting when and where will the light spring up let us start from the beginning the beginnin  g of the united states according to john adams letter to abigail adams on  july  when i look back to the year  from that time to this and recollect the series of political events the chain of causes and effects i am surprised at the suddenness as well as greatness of this revolution this revolution was not a unanimous decision by every one of the  colonies only about a third supported it another third didnt want the separation or were sympathizers and the last third was not for or against it in reality less than  percent supported it one way or another those who were dedicated and invested their time and money into it was less than  percent only about  percent sacrificed their time finances property or their lives—considering the population was less than  million about  people were responsible—for the united states we have today the process was not that of a small minority hijacking a cause or a country but a representative democracy it is what we have today called a republic do we all count in this system yes in the sense that we all have one vote no more no less at the same time it is optional because it is your right to exercise your rights and not the function of government to force you to exercise your rights yes it is a beautiful system we vote to elect a representative to represent us and this is called the representative government in other words we have a republic to secure godgiven rights more specifically life liberty inanimate property and the pursuit of happiness now it is time to ask the questions stated at the beginning at the end of the revolutionary war lafayette said humanity has won its battle liberty now has a country but where did it go who squandered it are we not intelligent enough to see it are we not the people to restore it to full glory thomas jefferson said i like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past the people of today are hardly the future he had in his dreams but the situation doesnt have to be the sad predicament that it is today we have the power to change for the better to be that dream the founders had in mind thomas jefferson said the will of the people is the only legitimate foundation of any government or was benjamin franklin right in wondering it is a republic but can we keep it there is a certain need to protect what is given to us actively or else there is attrition it disappears slowly without us knowing the masters of the craft of liberty are all dead and long gone it is for us to speculate on what it means to have the full extent of their dream for the people of the future and the nation they founded what is our responsibility to them and even more importantly to recover and pass it on to the future,1

that the electricity can be produced completely cofree after a few years of operation even the climate balance for the production and disposal of the solar modules at the end of their useful life is less harmful to the environment than with other systems for conventional power generation
there are almost  photovoltaic systems in vienna which together produce around  gwh of electricity annually this will supply almost  households with ecological electricity
in order to further expand this share and also to contribute to reducing the ecological footprint in the district we call for the nationwide expansion of photovoltaic modules the roof of the
the wiener linien tram depot on gudrunstrasse is ideally suited as an area for photovoltaic modules that is why we submitted an application to the district council on july   according to calculations up to  gwh of electricity per year can be produced there in this way around  households in favoriten could be supplied with environmentally friendly electricity our application is to be implemented as part of the renovation of the tram depot
both on public and private buildings if you are interested in installing a photovoltaic system on your own roof you can even apply for funding from the city of vienna
in vienna  of the roof areas are suitable for producing clean electricity there is still a lot of potential here to supply the city with green electricity especially on the roofs of public buildings in the district in combination with green roofs the ecological potential can be further exploited

you did it — you kept hope alive — outstanding to celebrate  of kindness free w  purchase —plenty of seats still available on the right side of history train thing is it leaves the station when the polls close tuesday until then you can still be one of america’s good guys not comfortable with his latest racebased immigration fears don’t let history lump you in with the white hoods and robes crowd history has its eyes on all of us and history remembers an  d keep in mind history doesn’t play fair where we have only some of the information by the time the history of this time gets told history will have all the details and more history will have the mueller report in its full unredacted sweetness history will know every step along the way from his campaign’s first contact with the russian spies right up to him freely quoting the stolen emails on the campaign stage history will even have his tax returns how is that even fair but as much as history will have all the info at this point we really aren’t missing that much does each and every dot along the way need to be fully penciled in before we admit the obvious line between that first meeting and the knowing use of russianhacked documents on the campaign trail at this point does anyone think he is keeping his tax returns hidden out of a sense of humility in time every detail will be documented but right here right now we are already well past the reasonable doubt stage the right side of history train is blowing its final boarding call whistle allaboard and despite the purposefully crafted fears to the otherwise no hate here we really are ready to welcome in all late comers with kindness and appreciation and did i mention we have cookies see recipe below that this train exists at all much less that it is already rolling under a full head of steam is something incredibly worth celebrating everybody in this country owes a debt to all those who gave so much of themselves for these past two years to keep alive the hope that is at the heart of the american spirit from the very first full day in office with the women’s march to those who will spend monday knocking on doors to get out the vote there are so many owed so much thanks so until the end of day saturday  we are offering a  value hope and kindness gift box that has our embrace hope pin kind pin heal the world bumperrefrigerator magnet

we believe cooking to be about and are a great introduction to penzeys no coupon or code is needed and they come in four colors to see them click here and there’s good reason we were ready for this ready the day after the inauguration to start handing out tens of thousands of kind heart pins and embrace hope stickers the same forces of unlimited political spending that brought all this to the nation in  first started a trial version in our home state of wisconsin in  we were targeted for our outstanding public schools and universities and also for our leadership in environmental protection what they’ve done hasn’t been pretty but along the way we’ve learned a few things here is wisconsin it began with what’s best described as a blitzkrieg attack on our state’s teachers it was well planned well funded and it was all about breaking the teachers’ spirits for a while it worked the inhumanity of using their media to turn teachers into villains in the eyes of the people of wisconsin simply to reward the governor’s benefactors with tax cuts was too much for us the center of the attack was the state’s largest school district here in milwaukee the first inservice day of back to school that fall we had a newlycreated teach gift box on every teacher’s and support staff’s desk  in total in it along with two spices were a teachers care bumper sticker a teach pin and a page teach mini cook booklet somehow it helped i’ve had mps teachers tell me it had gotten to the point where they did not want to go out in public for fear of being asked what they did for a living with all the right wing hate being directed at them am radio talkers really are like cancer to everything good in our area and as much as this opened our eyes to the power of pins and as good as the spices were and i still see the original teachers care bumper stickers ultimately it was the booklet that turned the tide in the face of the inhumanity being directed at the teachers by simply showing the humanity of teachers and their kindness the bubble of hate towards them burst it was an eyeopener so we were ready for the women’s march january   i don’t know if any of us understand just how much every american owes to those who participated in the women’s march all the damage done here in wisconsin everything we are still trying to dig out from was accomplished because they had us convinced they were popular and had the will of the people the outpouring of humanity that was the women’s march dwarfed the inauguration crowds the previous day he lied so hard about that because he needed it to set in motion all he wanted to do but the myth of popular support never left the ground the history books should teach  like dday  it’s that important so it’s two years later and thanks to everyone who marched on january  and everyone who’s pitched in since hope is still alive and that’s a reason to celebrate stop into our store for your hope and kindness box and if you haven’t already jump on the right side of history train before it leaves this coming tuesday vote vote vote oh yeah cookies for grandma moog’s gingersnaps click here chuggachugga whoowhoo bill penzey billpenzeyscom with the

here in new york we won’t stand for a democratic congressional rep that casually employs racebaiting as a tactic to discredit new voices a few thoughts on this since i first heard the news patel is the th most common last name in the us with nearly  of us in the country bearing the name most know we’re not all related in fact an entire region of india employs the last name and today it’s the most common name for a doctor in america but we also write p  aint act work live love and yes — sometimes we run for congress on the subject of fundraising — raising money for a political campaign is a necessary evil trust that for most of us running it’s the worst part of this process and one i hope to change by supporting public financing of elections and banning corporate pac money i’m running my campaign differently for just this reason it’s my hope that in the future political campaigns will be used as acts of service to educate and engage more voters this approach costs less than mailtv attack ads and is better for democracy overall and only since she brought it up — at least we’ve never taken money from corporate and wall street pacs or from anyone with the last name trump  if you haven’t contributed yet now’s a good chance to prove the establishment wrong about who’s backing our campaign still happily accepting support from anyone with the last name patel too,1

from mary flynn access to justice attorney kate harrison an independent thinker the easy road is to accept the “common wisdom” of one side or the other the harder road is carefully examining issues and deciding on facts  kate • took her experience designing judicial performance systems throughout the world to craft a responsible police accountability measure that makes the few investigations into alleged police misconduct more transparent and professional the city manager continues to manage the department and the city council still sets policy • using her years of public sector budgeting expertise helped design a strong budget reserve policy for the city that restricts use of reserve funds to very specific emergency circumstances the council should not be able to raid these funds • listened to the entire community and voted for the recent sidewalk ordinance that limits the amount of objects on our streets to protect health and safety and allow everyone to enjoy our commons but kate also revised the item to make sure that health and human services rather than the police be the first to talk to people on the streets and that poverty isn’t criminalized by providing connections to community services and jobs like those offered by the new downtown streets team instead of fines that will never be paid kate has been endorsed by • gordon wozniak former councilmember for her acumen in budgeting • george perezvelez councilmember wengraf’s appointee to the police review commission for her commonsense approach to police accountability • the alameda county democratic lawyers’ club for her knowledge and experience in government as karen weinstein peralta community college director stated “while here in berkeley we like to put our candidates in one or the other camp kate is something special  independent in thought and action which is why i support her for berkeley city council district ” join those who have examined the record vote for kate mary lavery flynn attorneyaccess to justice consultant,1

recently two prominent gop congressmen representatives mark meadows nc and jim jordan oh have called for the firing of attorney general jeff sessions for recusing himself from the mueller investigation these two politicians think that a man who was highly active on the trump campaign and who himself could potentially be part of the russia investigation should be fired because he didn’t intervene on the president’s behalf in that investigation expressing one’s  desire for political interference into independent investigations at the very same time one is accusing the justice department of bias is the height of hypocrisy and subverts legal precedents not to be outdone last week senators lindsey graham rsc and chuck grassley ria demanded a new special investigation into christopher steele the author of the trump dossier despite having no public evidence of wrongdoing they insist that steele has likely committed a crime their behavior prompted senator feinstein dca to release the transcripts of the fusion gps interviews in those interviews the firm’s founder details how steele was so alarmed by what he found out about russia’s engagement with trump’s campaign that he felt dutybound to bring his findings to us law enforcement neither of these stunts by trump enablers in congress are honest attempts at truth or justice they aim solely to protect the president’s power while securing their own just like you would see in a banana republic for the sake of the country we all love we must step up our actions to protect mueller’s important work we must send a message to speaker ryan and majority leader mitch mcconnell that efforts to undermine the russia special counsel won’t stand please sign this petition today and encourage your family and friends to do the same together we’ll have a major showing when we deliver this petition to republican leaders in congress,1

the belief that there is no reality beyond the physical has dominated the scientific establishment for more than a century this belief was inspired by darwin is theory of unintelligent design which has never been proved and has spread to the entire academic community in the united states where it is held as such absolute and fundamental truth that academic people who express an interest in precognition telepathy clairvoyance remote viewing psychokinesis energy medicin  e spirit entities the power of prayer reincarnation levitation or intelligent design are treated as if they were mentally incompetent shunned by their colleagues and denied publication funding and employment obviously this kind of social manipulation is neither scientific nor scholarly anybody who knows logic knows that you cant prove a proposition of the form there are no such things unless you have a complete knowledge of the entire universe in all its dimensions and conversely it is necessary to find only one such thing to disprove it in  i dreamed of my grandmother is death an hour before i received the telegram that is all the proof i ever needed to know that there was more to reality than what could be explained by known physical laws billions of people have had similar experiences  more than  in one study done in switzerland year after year gallup polls have shown that more than  of americans believe in god or a spiritual reality establishment scientists explain this away by saying that we are all uninformed unintelligent superstitious andor delusional there is literally a ton of evidence of the psychic and the spiritual at the rhine research center and yet establishment scientists claim that this evidence has to be flawed because they know with certainty that such things couldnt possibly exist dirty science exposes this inaccurate unscientific and manipulative thinking the lies behind it and the arrogance in representing it as scientific it calls this corruption it compares this corruption to the corruption that led to the protestant reformation and the corruption that prompted the french revolution the people we have trusted to give us accurate knowledge have betrayed us  million college graduates in america have been exposed to this invalid thinking also everybody in college or contemplating college needs to be warned of it do them a favor and give them dirty science for christmas you can find it on amazoncom is this a good book see on amazoncom its good reviews and the awards it has won  bob gebelein author,1

"below is one of the questions in the rome newstribune is recent qa with the candidates for sheriff and i want to expand on my response since we were limited to  words
the reason being is that mental health and the lack of resources for those who need help is one of the biggest issues currently facing law enforcement that is because people in a mental health crisis are unfortunately more likely to encounter police and often end up in jail than to get medical assistance
q the jail medical facility is undergoing a major expansion to include a mental health wing how do you envision using it
a this splostfunded expansion is a step in the right direction to providing a safer environment for inmates and employees since the closing of northwest regional our jail has been flooded with people with mental illnesses and no access to resources we have been ill equipped to handle it we currently have four medical beds insufficient to say the least the new unit will bring that number closer to  new treatment programs will also be part of the expansion i thank the citizens of floyd county for recognizing this major need and voting yes to the  splost
i am also focused on promoting training i was one of the first in our agency and our area to seek out cit training and am also a certified crisis intervention instructor our deputies need this training to do their jobs effectively in fact i would love to see all local law enforcement agencies get more training in this area
i also want to point out that with such a major decline in the number of mental health facilities services and funding in our state over the years we are fortunate to have an organization like nami rome ga here to provide support education and advocacy other organizations doing great things to support people coping with a mental illness include elevation house livingproof recovery and nextdoor at livingproof recovery should i be elected i would look forward to collaborating with these organizations and others to find better solutions to this issue in our community
i hope that by creating a safer environment adding training for our staff and partnering with community organizations we can help some of these people with mental illnesses get on a healthier path instead of jail being a revolving door

what are the chances that the original front double doors to the blacksmith shop built when the a minchau blacksmith shop was erected in  would survive what are the chances that the doors would have been preserved in such good condition over the years see our post and picture from the edmonton journal dated june th already in the  is the a minchau blacksmith shop was recognized by the province of alberta for the important historical and economical value it  possessed and the royal alberta museum approached fred and stanley minchau asking if the museum could have the doors and in exchange the museum would supply them with a new set of doors this was in  and the doors were then on display for many years to come in the pioneer section of the museum with other notable pieces from that era that important historical value of the blacksmith shop has only increased and greatly as time has gone by and it has been a full  years since the doors were originally donated to the museum at the province is request half a century ago how fortunate we are as a city and as a province to have in our possession not only the original doors from the  blacksmith shop but also the original blacksmith shop itself typically it would be a reversed situation historical building is demolished we find an original piece or part of its structure that belongs to it people are captivated by its discovery but then are left to imagination to fill in the gaps of history we do not need to rely on our imagination in the case of the a minchau blacksmith shop built in  it still stands in its original form and in its original place of construction in the heart of old strathcona a vitally important cornerstone of our history and heritage and our economic and social growth is still intact and today needs our help in protecting it from demolition we believe that the alberta provincial government already understood the significant value of the a minchau blacksmith shop in  when they approached the blacksmith shop owners fred and stanley asking for the doors to be preserved in the provincial museum at the time the shop was in full operation and not needing a historical designation itself today it does we believe that the municipal government already understood the significant value of the a minchau blacksmith shop in  and further so in  as per official city of edmonton records the city of edmonton planning and development department selected a project team in  to identify significant buildings bridges landscapes cemeteries trees architectural fragments street furnishings and monuments the result was the register of historic resources in edmonton  which at the time was a list of  resources that merited conservation in  the register of historic resources in edmonton was presented to city council the a minchau blacksmith shop is on that inventory of historic resources unfortunately being on the register of historic resources in edmonton an inventory of historic resources that merit conservation does not save a historic heritage building from demolition this we now know to be a direct result of weak legislation on the part of the municipal government while these laws may be weak in protecting historical heritage sites to be sure they are strong and strident in favoring developers who seem to want more and concede less currently and as of may th edmonton city council has voted to have mayor don iveson officially approach the provincial government to assist in granting the a minchau blacksmith shop an official provincial heritage designation which would protect it from demolition see our post dated june nd kudos to the mayor and city council for taking this great step forward kudos to everyone who has written their elected government officials your voices are being heard and have helped support the municipal government is challenging decision municipal legislation needs to change now but today we need the province to step up we have the original blacksmith door we have the original blacksmith shop we do not as yet have the official designation to save this historical heritage building we are in a race to save our historical heritage buildings from being demolished please email and write the provincial government today the province has the legal power to designate an official heritage status which will protect the a minchau blacksmith shop from demolition and provide a place of living history for all to enjoy please send emails to culturetourismministergovabca ricardo miranda  minister of culture and tourism premiergovabca premier rachel notley in subject header for both write designate the minchau blacksmith shop official heritage status please let the provincial government know that you support an official registered designation for the a minchau blacksmith shop and that the minchau blacksmith shop represents a large part of our history and heritage and should be preserved please ask the provincial government to designate the a

major important takeaway from this saga anyone who argues that the jewish community tries to silence criticism of israel by calling it antisemitic is arguing in bad faith hard stop the entirety of the jewish political spectrum and the entirety of the national political spectrum and the entirety of the media spectrum vigorously criticized israeli policy yesterday we are yet to see or make an accusation of antisemitism related to any of these actual criticisms of i  sraeli policy from jewish insider  the condemnation of the israeli decision was swift and resounding on thursday though some minority voices spoke out in support house speaker nancy pelosi dca called it a “sad reversal” from the initial decision “deeply disappointing” and “a sign of weakness” house majority leader steny hoyer dmd who just returned from israel as head of a member democratic delegation said he urged netanyahu on wednesday not to make such an “unwarranted and selfdestructive” decision he also lamented that dermer’s original “assurances to me” were “not true” mainstream jewish organizations including aipac  were critical of the move the jewish federations of north america said “every member of congress without exception should be allowed to visit israel” the adl  antidefamation league called the move “counterproductive” the simon wiesenthal center said israel’s initial instinct to allow the visit was “the right one” and the union for reform judaism president rick jacobs said he feared the action will “reverberate for years both in undermining israeli democracy and in making israel a ‘wedge issue’ in american politics” halie soifer executive director of the jewish democratic council of america  said israel was playing into trump’s “goal of politicizing support for israel” mark mellman president of the democratic majority for israel – official page  said that while the two congresswomen declined an offer to engage to balance the itinerary for the trip the netanyahu government was “wrong and unwise” to deny their entry j street launched an online petition to call on israel to reverse its decision the zioness movement urged american jews who feel gutpunched to resist the temptation to turn your back on your community or the state of israel the the new york times editorial asked “what are trump and netanyahu afraid of” and the washington post editorial board called the decision “a disgrace to both countries” writing in the atlantic  former us ambassador to israe dan shapiro labeled the decision a “massive selfown what a bulldozer to drive through the bipartisan consensus on israel” the times of israel editorinchief david horovitz said israel’s move “smacks of a loss of will by our leadership a loss of selfconfidence” and the times’ bari weiss wrote that netanyahu had “bowed before a tweet” bloomberg  is eli lake writes that if the cost of trump is support for israel is an expectation for partisan obeisance then how much are those policies really worth”,1

judicial primary elections cancelled at this time the nc senate passed a conference report known as the electoral freedom act of  this is a rather deceptive name for a bill which has eliminated the requirement for a primary election for any judges running for election in this state regardless of whether they are running for seats on the nc supreme court the nc court of appeals for superior courts or for district court judgeships normally candidates running for thes  e judgeships would have filed a notice of candidacy in february and they would have participated in primary elections held in may as it presently stands these candidates will not have to file a notice of candidacy until june th  and no later than pm on june th  there is also no requirement for a primary election typically when a primary election is held the  highest votegetters participate in the november general election however if no primary election is scheduled then you can end up with perhaps a dozen candidates running in a judicial contest and the candidate who wins could potentially receive only  of the vote which would be a rather startling outcome as it presently stands it appears that the general assembly will hold a special session in january to examine the possibility of adopting new judicial districts for our state for judges serving in our district and superior courts as well as for district attorneys at that time it is also possible that a constitutional amendment could be proposed that could be placed on the ballot for voters to consider as early as the may  primary which could result in the adoption of a new judicial appointmentsmerit selection process this new merit selection process could allow the republican majority in the general assembly to appoint judges in our state the constitutional amendment can also create what is known as judicial retention elections where a judge holding office would just be voted in or out of office but the person would not be running against another candidate all of this can have profound ramifications which i would encourage each of you to closely follow as this process moves forward it is essential that the public have confidence and trust in the integrity of our judges and in our judicial system we should clearly avoid any process that politicizes judges serving on our courts please continue to track this process i have been following it closely and some of the changes that have been proposed give me great concern there was absolutely no reason to cancel primaries for any candidate running for the nc supreme court or the nc court of appeals since those courts will not be impacted by the redrawing of judicial districts however they could be impacted if judicial retention elections are approved as a result of the passing of a constitutional amendment this is probably why they have canceled those primaries as well,1

for months elizabeth has been near or at the top of the list of candidates that voters are considering for president according to the latest economistyougov poll  of voters across all age groups are considering voting for warren including  of selfdescribed liberals and  of selfdescribed moderates elizabeth is best positioned to unite the party and lead the democratic ticket to defeat donald trump

elizabeth is progressive effective and has lived a life that has prepared her for this fight with a strong organization of more than  staff on the ground in  states bolstered by a movement of more than  grassroots donors we are confident that as americans continue to get to know elizabeth theyll see what we see every day elizabeth is the only candidate who can unite the party and defeat donald trump in november

today’s special session of the north carolina general assembly today a bill was filed and introduced known as “house bill ” titled “ballot designationsreferenda” the sole purpose of the bill was to eliminate the power of a commission currently composed of secretary of state elaine marshall a democrat attorney general josh stein a democrat and paul coble a republican who’s in charge of legislative services at the general assembly from writing a brief caption or syno  psis of each of the six constitutional amendments that will appear on the ballot in november’s general election this means that the public will not have any context or understanding of these amendments as it currently stands the language that will appear relating to each constitutional amendment is vague obscure and in many instances disguises the true purpose and intent of each of the constitutional amendments therefore voters could be persuaded and misled into voting for an amendment because they are worded in a way that might lead someone to believe that they were a good idea this type of intentional voter deception is problematic and unfortunate the true purpose of these amendments is for the republican majority to do messaging around them that will increase the turnout of their base voters in november the republican majority is afraid that without these constitutional amendments on the ballot to drive out their base democrats have an excellent opportunity to break the republican supermajority and to potentially take the majority in this year’s general election i hope that voters will be smart enough not to be persuaded by these type of tactics two of these amendments are specifically targeted at undercutting the authority of governor cooper and future governors to appoint persons serving on over  boards and commissions as well as appointing judges in our state in a manner in which it has been conducted for decades this is why former governors both republicans and democrats are opposed to the idea of amendments curtailing the power of our governor which is already weaker than many states,1

a new study by the thomas b fordham institute which is an education reform think tank found that there is a large gap between the number of white students when compared to the number of black and hispanic students in gifted programs in schools across our country but particularly here in north carolina the institute reviewed national data on gifted programs in highpoverty schools which are generally filled with black and brown students the “gifted gap” report found tha  t while most highpoverty schools offer programs for gifted students they tend to have few students enrolled researchers involved in the study determined that africanamerican and hispanic students are underrepresented in gifted programs in all states and in all types of schools but even more so in schools where most students come from impoverished backgrounds north carolina is among  states where fewer than  percent of black and hispanic students are in gifted programs compared with almost  percent of all north carolina students in north carolina schools with poverty levels of  percent or higher only  percent of black and hispanic students and  percent of all students were in gifted programs this finding was among the nation’s lowest levels the study reinforces the findings of counted out a  investigative series by the charlotte observer and the raleigh news amp observer that examined seven years of state data focusing on lowincome students with high scores on state math exams the data compiled showed that lowincome students were less likely than nonpoor students with similar scores to get access to gifted programs and advanced classes the fordham report recommends using new universal screening practices to identify gifted students it is disappointing to see that we are not investing in our students from lowincome families and in students of color to help them to achieve their highest potential our school systems need to make sure that they are investing in all of our students and that they are allowing them the opportunity to become part of gifted programs these programs can allow them to succeed not only in school but also during the course of their lives httpwwwcharlotteobservercom…ed…articlehtml,1

celebrate kavanaugh victory with a voting party surreal we just went through a very unsettling but clarifying event democrats and the media were revealed in all their nastiness and opposition to the basic tenets of justice it was and is unsettling but it was also clarifying the venom was spewed not at trump but at a main stream republican judge with a stellar career and not a whiff of scandal during his long public service this is not trump derangement syndrome but is much broader that’s important for everyone to consider the war is not between trump and the progressives but the progressives and those committed to the american republic and its basic principles of liberty and justice for those who thought the rancor from the left was against trump but not main stream republicans that illusion went out the window fullthroated attacks were and are being aimed at a bush main stream republican the left is clearly waging amoral war on all things nonprogressive and against the foundations of western civilization such as the rule of law it is truly frightening but another point of clarification one about strategy was also evident we learned how to win the way to effectively combat the attacks on our culture is to fight back hard again this is not an allusion to trump fighting back but to judge kavanaugh and the republican senators we learned how to win we need to press forward for one more month this event ended in victory through the addition of a constitutionalist to the us supreme court a bullet was dodged and that’s exhilarating we should rejoice in the win but remembering how this win happened we should also throw ourselves into the ongoing political warfare that is now clearly raging around us so we suggest you bring celebration and work together by having a voting party ballots here in oregon will be mailed next week invite some friends together at your home or church to discuss the candidates and issues and mark your ballots you know what’s at stake and will be voting a voting party is a way to encourage your friends and relatives to vote as well and have fun at the same time peapac’s biblical ballot measure voters guide will also be in the mail next week if you’re not on our mailing list go to peapacorg and give us your address and let us know how many guides you’d like oregon’s vote by mail system is a great opportunity to get together talk through the issues and candidates and encourage one another to vote remember good folks may disagree at points and that’s okay but have some fun get some work done and encourage others,1

about the recent defacing of the swinging bridge  graffiti is actually a terrible quality of life crime just one instance if not dealt with immediately and severely can spawn lots of imitation with the resulting civic squalor not far behind  i hope the city after its investigation removes this as soon as possible im told that few things are more frustrating to vandals than to have their handiwork disappear quickly  depending on the cost to make repairs this could wind up being a class c felony that means up to ten years in prison given what the bridge means to charles city historically and emotionally i do not think throwing the book at the perp would be resisted by too many  let me get this right one of the goals  if not the primary goal  of blm is achieving scrupulously fair and equal treatment of black suspects at the arrest bond trial and punishment phases of the criminal justice system the argument which enjoys near universal support around rural iowa as far i can tell is that equal protection means equal protection doesnt it undermine that message then for supporters of this message to show themselves to be willing to commit open flagrant intentional and largely needless felonies to promote the cause in fact doesnt committing felonies like this give support to the argument that people holding this view point are more likely to engage in felonies than people not holding this view point in other words wouldnt a strong letter to the editor of the cc press be more effective while not weakening a good argument  it sure would be nice if some prominent local supporters of blm would step up and denounce this criminal behavior my personal opinion is that denouncing criminal behavior enhances the blm argument and advances the cause of equality in the justice system i still find it hard to believe that someone actually did this,1

i was flying from dubai to melbourne and i got on the plane and one of the air crew came up and said “would you like to take a shower mr proctor” i thought she was putting me on i said “there’s a shower on the plane” she said “yes but we’re booking times to use it now so if you want to take one on this flight you have to put in your name” i jumped at the chance when my turn came i got in there and it was a big big room on that plane with beautiful heated tile floors it was amazing i just wanted to be able to say i’d had a shower at  feet now i’ve done this multiple times but you know if somebody had suggested “you’re going to fly from dubai to melbourne and you can have a shower a hot meal watch a movie or lay down and go to sleep” that would have sounded absolutely outrageous not too long ago how did the wright brothers ever even imagine they could make human beings fly people must have thought they were crazy to try to make something like that happen but they did it now we all take it for granted what’s worse is we usually reserve that kind of incredible invention and innovation for other people but let me tell you something there’s absolutely no difference between the wright brothers and you and me or anybody else the only difference is the wright brothers allowed themselves to dream they tuned into that special frequency where human beings can literally bring something that’s never existed before into reality all throughout history there have been men and women from ordinary backgrounds who set out with nothing but a dream in their minds and were able to accomplish something extraordinary it would seem these people were special or fortunate or blessed in some way that most people are not but that’s not the case because what makes the difference when it comes to achieving the impossible is not fortune or favor it’s decisions and commitments i talk to a lot of people who just don’t believe they have that “something special” the great people of the world must have had to do the great things they did that makes me very upset because i know it’s not true the ability to do something great to achieve independence and freedom to shape the future—that’s within every single one of us but most people they’ve lost the ability to dream and that’s where it all begins so i want to invite you today to dream again dream up a future where your finances are no longer a source of stress dream up a future where you’re no longer fighting to make ends meet dream up a future where you can hop on a plane from dubai to melbourne and take a shower on the way while you’re  feet up i’ve done it you can too all of that is well within your reach and more all you have to do is make a decision to do what it takes to experience those things and make a commitment that you’re not going to give up hope until you do if you dream of owning your own business working from home and having financial freedom there’s one small decision i’m going to ask you to make today right now my good friend adrian morrison is an absolute expert at helping people from all over the world achieve extraordinary income results with ecommerce he’s putting on a free workshop this week where he’s going to show everyone who attends how to setup their own online store how to advertise for it and even what products to sell in it maybe you’ve heard of people having success in ecommerce today and thought “well those people must be lucky but that’s not me” stop that’s no way to think that’s no way to dream can you imagine what might be possible for you you don’t have to start without a map for where you’re going because adrian created this training specifically to give that to you he’s even going to show you the exact products he’s sold in his own ecommerce stores that have helped him make millions he’s no different no more special than you and me he’s just allowed himself to dream and he’s committed to making his dream a reality are you ready to dream again click the link below to sign up for adrian’s free training httpinviteesaworkshopcombob you’ll be glad you did thank you,1

"hemp farming what happened
many of you know that i am pro cannabis but i am also very pro hemp at my core i am a conservative which originally meant that you were a conservationist or believed that we should have a balance between nature and business hemp allows us to find that balance
hemp is a great for a variety of reasons if youre not familiar with this product then let me share a few with you
takes less water to grow than some traditional crops therefor less resources are used to grow this plant to a mature harvest
can be used to make textiles like clothes ropes shoes and other fibrous materials
can be used as a fuel source
replaces paper and plastics breaks down in the environment after a short period of time
draws out harmful elements out of the ground making soil healthier for other crops or for cleaning up contaminated ground like from oil spills
since it can be used in paper and plastic it would also cut down on deforestation more trees means more oxygen and less carbon dioxide in the air
can also be used a food source
can be used in construction as a material called hempcrete
used in the production of making super conductors which is the next generation of magnetic technology
so if hemp is so useful and we have legalized it in kansas then why are not we taking advantage of this
i have heard several reasons but one of them is that we dont have businesses set up to process or manufacture hemp in the state this is where i come in
the farmers want to grow this crop but there is no where for it to go after it is grown i support the small businesses that are the backbone of the this great country that is why as your representative i would work to pass legislation that would incentivize start up businesses to open up shop in these areas i would work to offer things like grants low interest loans networking resources between the farmers and the processors i would also work to provide other incentives for basic processing businesses and to any that relate to the items mentioned above this includes technology companies clothing factories alcohol production plants etc
let is grow hemp and grow our localsmall businesses while bringing high quality good paying jobs back to the heartland of america kansans are some of the hardest workers i have ever known and during these turbulent times many are left struggling to find jobs or keep the ones they have
i want to help get kansans back to work or if they have a job give them other opportunities to be successful and one of the ways we can do this is by expanding our hemp growing and operational footprint in our state
are you pro
hemp farmer environment technology business
then i am the candidate for you

take a look because this will help you better understand who your prospect is and what the biggest opportunity is in your market when i present this idea of prospect awareness to our clients amp students i present it as a pyramid on the bottom of the pyramid is the unaware prospect that’s the biggest part of the market when you go up a level the area shrinks and then you go up another level and as you move up and up the size of the marketplace – the number of people at that level – decreases but it becomes easier to convert them as we go down levels – to the bottom unaware layer of the pyramid – that is our biggest opportunity because it’s the biggest universe there are more people but the reason it’s harder to convert at the bottom is because there is a lot more belief that we have to create in the minds of our prospects and this is the thing that i want to share with you today what prospects need to be educated and which do not the individual who is at the top or close to the top already has existing beliefs  they have understanding and insights this guy  on the other hand when an individual is completely unaware like this guy  we have to lead them through the entire string of beliefs there are things we have to say to them that we don’t have to say to the person who is at the problem level of awareness for example the individual who is at the problem level of awareness we don’t have to educate them to the fact that they have a problem they know they have a problem they’re already aware of the fact that they have a problem the person who goes on google and searches for flood repair  or something like that already knows they have a problem whereas the person who is unaware that there is flooding going on behind the sheetrock we have to educate them that’s one additional belief – in this simplistic example – that we have to establish with that individual and still the higher up on the level of awareness the fewer beliefs that we have to establish because they’ve already been established on the lower awareness level how direct do you need to be in your message the last thing i really want you to start to see is that as you go higher on the levels of awareness the more direct you can be in your ideas and talk for the funnel so for instance let’s say we have a prospect who is aware that they have had a flood and they’ve got damage and they need it repaired and now they’re searching on google for flood repair with a certain type of method for that person we don’t have to start with an indirect big idea that is slanted toward being intellectually interesting and invoking curiosity instead jump into their thought process at a place that’s appropriate for them let’s begin the dialogue there whereas for the unaware individual we can’t start like that we can’t jump in and have an ad that says “what you need to know about flood repair” or “the six reasons why we can get your home back to its original condition in  hours or less guaranteed” you can’t start there with the completely unaware because they are unaware we have to take the “scenic route” and that’s what brings me back to why the lower you are on the awareness scale the more difficult it is to convert because we need to establish more beliefs in that type of prospect and we need to have a big marketing idea that takes the scenic route we need to find a big marketing idea that is intellectually interesting to create a level of engagement so that eventually we can lead them into the direct hook something such as “here are the five reasons why you want us” but we can’t start there with the unaware understanding prospect levels of awareness is the key to being able to create the right message at the right time get this right and you’ll have them lining up at your door so the question is how do you find a big marketing idea that grabs attention and allows you to acquire new customers even in the most competitive markets if youre serious about capitalizing on this biggest and most untapped opportunity in the market i strongly suggest you grab a copy of my new book it is called how to find your big marketing idea and it is just  on the next page this will be a total game changer for you,1

on tuesday june   we paid bond to free our th person from cook county jail ccj since our founding in  ccbf has posted more than  through our revolving bail fund to free people from ccj or home confinement due to electronic monitoring none of this would be possible without the incredible amount of support weve received from each and every one of you despite significant reforms to the pretrial process in cook county in the last year thousands of  people are still jailed before trial at ccj simply for being poor in september  chief judge timothy evans issued general order a which requires cook county judges to set money bonds only in amounts people can afford to pay the order was successful in decreasing the number of people incarcerated at ccj by more than  in three months and has the potential to eliminate the use of unaffordable money bonds entirely but wide variance in implementation has stalled more significant impact in the first three months of  only  of people ordered to pay money bonds were actually able to pay them and secure release now more than nine months after the order took effect approximately  people are still incarcerated in cook county jail only because they cannot afford to pay their money bonds since judge evans’ order went into effect last september ccbf has posted bond for  people we continue to get calls every week from people in cook county jail whose loved ones are incarcerated as a result of money bonds they can’t afford to pay this is in direct conflict with general order a which states that no one should be incarcerated simply because they can’t afford to pay bond pretrial incarceration resulting from inability to pay money bond has severe consequences and can lead to lasting negative effects after just  hours a person can be fired from their job and put on the path to eviction after a month of pretrial incarceration people may lose access to benefits such as social security and medicaid people incarcerated pretrial are also more likely to be convicted and receive longer sentences which creates lifelong collateral consequences through our revolving bail fund ccbf prevents some of these harms and allows people to fight their case from a place of freedom greatly increasing the likelihood of their case resolving favorably ccbf is dedicated volunteers also provide individualized support to people we bonds out of jail or off of house arrest no one should be incarcerated pretrial because they don’t have money to pay for bond we will continue to push for transformative permanent bail reform so that bail funds will no longer have to exist together we can  endmoneybail and pretrial incarceration,1

most of us parents know that too much screen time for our children is not a good idea however we find ourselves purchasing electronically based gifts for our children at christmas time as it is what they want or what everyone else is buying and we want our children to fit in some of us succumb to peer pressure by giving our children phones before they are ready for them or really need them for the most part we believe that they are harmless and some of us need science t  o tell us otherwise this science is not easy to gather as it means involving young people in what is called a longitudinal study which means they need to be followed over a course of several years not easy to have parents permission to follow their child for long periods of time just today this came across my screen and i wanted to share this with you the early findings of a premature thinning of the cortexes this means the brain is consolidating neurons earlier than what is considered normal this is important as we need a certain amount of grey matter during our maturation process so that we can continue to initiate the use of more synapsis which allows us to retain information that we will need in life when the cortexes prune  or delete synapsis too early it affects aspects of intelligence this is what the study will continue to research and discover throughout its year duration long story short do your best to limit the screen time of your family members and yes that includes mom and dad too afterall you are the role model your brain is not as affected as your child is however children have this great propensity to mimic their parent is behavior the do as they see not what they hear read books magazines play games do puzzles and interact over the coming holiday season with the screens neatly tucked away you might be surprised to find out how much you yourself want to be on your screen and perhaps you as well need a little more downtime to give your brain the reboot it needs balance on my friends,1

should new hampshire communities allow religious symbols to be part of their annual winter displays on town property many communities open the holiday season with christmas related events  a santa parade singing carols and the ceremonial first lighting of a christmas tree in durham this year a menorah lighting to recognize the start of the jewish celebration of hanukkah was added to the holiday celebration but the lighted menorah was not permitted to be added to the  public holiday display that included a lighted christmas tree in part for fear that the menorah might be vandalized this has given rise to a debate as to whether the town should have any religious themed displays at all the town human rights commission and town council are considering the question proponents of removing the display from town property say a public display for the christian holiday may be offensive to people of other religions or who have no religious belief at all they favor a more neutral “winter carnival” themed display “i am a person of no religious affiliation these things don’t bother me but i understand how they might bother someone else” said kitty marple the chairman of both the durham human rights commission and the town council advocates of keeping the display say removing the display altogether is an example of political correctness going too far some feel a christmas tree is symbolic more of the holiday season than an expression of any religious faith “the whole idea behind the lights is to bring light into darkness it’s a positive thing” said sally tobias a member of the durham town council others argue that the town square should be a place for communities to express their cultural diversity and therefore the christmas tree  and all other religious symbols  should be allowed,1

did you know that right now the timeshare giants are fighting hard to outlaw the entire timeshare cancellation industry at first glance this seems insane considering the timeshare cancellation industry exists to help timeshare owners who have been lied to and misled escape horrific amp binding timeshare contracts who wouldn’t want that however when considered for a moment it makes a lot of sense but we’ll talk more about this in a moment for now i want to ask you a s  ingle question would you still own your timeshare if you had had a  hour “grace period” to decide whether or not you should buy the timeshare let me explain most timeshare pitches are incredibly high pressure and you must decide whether or not you will buy the same day you do a timeshare tour they often mislead you into thinking that they are offering an incredible deal but this deal only lasts for that day “if you leave today you won’t be able to buy again at this price” first this is a lie second the only reason they do this is to pressure you to buy it is one of the many common lies that we hear everyday working with our clients which is why we feel it is so critical to ensure the timeshare owner is represented and protected by the timeshare cancellation industry if you don’t already know me my name is chuck mcdowell and i am the father of the timeshare cancellation industry and this isn’t the first time the timeshare industry has tried to bully me several years ago i was sued for  million by the largest timeshare company in the world they were not very happy when i defeated them in federal court i stood my ground when others shut their doors because i knew there were millions of timeshare owners who had been lied to during their timeshare experience i also knew if i folded to the timeshare giant’s demands they would never stop taking advantage of timeshare owners yet again myself and wesley financial group are having to stand up to the timeshare giants to protect timeshare owners as i mentioned before right now the timeshare giants are trying to sneak legislation that would outlaw the entire timeshare cancellation industry they want to make it illegal to help timeshare owners this would be devastating for the millions of timeshare owners who have been lied to and mislead during their timeshare experience we are going to fight their legislation tooth and nail because we know it is the right thing to do if you own timeshare here’s what i ask first answer the question from earlier would you have still purchased your timeshare if you had had a  hour “grace period” to decide whether or not you should purchase the timeshare why or why not second if you’d like to learn if you could qualify for timeshare cancellation we have a short quiz that thousands of timeshare owners have already taken in this quiz you’ll find out if there’s a chance we can help you plus you’ll learn a bit about us and why we exist and finally if there’s a good chance you might qualify we’ll send you a package in the mail that will teach you everything you need to know about how to get rid of your timeshare once and for all i founded this industry because i knew there were good people stuck in bad situations wesley financial group has grown to nearly  employees who come to work every day to help good timeshare owners who feel stuck in bad timeshare contracts we fight every day and we will continue to fight until every mislead timeshare owner has the opportunity to get out sincerely chuck mcdowell owner of wesley financial group “father of the timeshare cancellation industry”,1

"we now know that deriving from the sun well but did you know that it could also be possible to obtain energy from the shadows
a team of scientists from the university of singapore has created a device called a shadow effect power generator which uses the contrast between lighted and shaded areas to generate electricity and potentially selfpower all of our electronic devices
it consists of a series of cells arranged on a flexible and transparent plastic film with a thin gold film deposited on a silicon wafer
based on laboratory experiments seg proved to be twice as effective as silicon solar cells by simply playing on the light shadow transition scientists noted that the energy produced by the device in the presence of shadows created under internal lighting conditions was sufficient to power a digital clock ie  v furthermore according to the creators it can be produced at a lower cost than silicon photovoltaic cells the team also demonstrated that the seg can act as a selfpowered sensor for tracking moving objects when an object passes near the seg it casts an intermittent shadow on the device and activates the sensor to register the presence and movement of the object itself
other materials will be tested in addition to gold to further reduce costs furthermore we will try to create wearable segs connected to clothing capable of producing energy during normal daily activities by exploiting the changes in lighting of the environments external or internal in which we find ourselves
apparently the shadow is not only a great ally for defending oneself from the heat of summer

"an open letter to constituents
hi my name is celeste yarbrough bayles
ive officially thrown my hat into the race to represent ward  place  on the homewood city council and i wanted to take a minute to properly introduce myself to the voters of west homewood
i was raised in homewood graduated from hhs in  and have decided to raise my family in this small town just over the mountain from the city of birmingham because it is home and while i might be new to politics i know from experience things people like and do not like about our city
in my professional life at employment screening services ess i manage a team in charge of over  million of client accounts during the current pandemic we continue to help both small businesses and large corporations continue to hire new staff even as the world seems to have stopped in its tracks this experience gives me a unique perspective on how to effectively navigate this pandemic from a business and management perspective
through my outreach with organizations like alabama women in business board member alabama possible youth board member and the birmingham business alliance mentor i have seen first hand how community outreach and effective leadership can change lives
i am running for these reasons
with the world feeling like it is on fire some days we need new leadership that will take us in a new direction
we need to get rid of the cliques and cronyism in city government this will create a more inclusive environment where all citizens feel they have input and do not have to know someone to get solutions to their problems
as the world we live in evolves around us i want to make sure the council reaches out to the community with uptodate information through all its channels the public needs to know how this pandemic is affecting our city and the status of important initiatives like the revitalization of the derelict hotel district on oxmoor road
i want to create a completely transparent city council in terms of city spending if youre paying taxes then you should at least get to know how theyre spent right
we need a city manager to improve efficiency i will move to install a qualified candidate so we can streamline the way our small government runs
i want to push to keep the city of homewood diverse and inclusive so that all citizens no matter what their background can feel welcome in our community inthistogether
thank you for the privilege of your time and i hope we will be able to get to know more about each other soon

dear elected representatives of yonkers i am writing to express my opposition to the proposed ups facility at  tuckahoe road in yonkers my motherinlaw raised seven children in this home on bonnie briar road and the activity at that facility if allowed to proceed will destroy the quality of life for her and the entire neighborhood and will also lower property values of the immediate neighborhood why are not our elected representatives preventing this degradation of  yonkers life from happening there will be  semi trailers coming into that property every day beginning at  am and nearly  ups trucks what about the air quality for the neighborhood will ups be providing them with personal protective equipment will the city of yonkers bear the financial cost of additional ailments due to poor air quality i don’t believe that gas tanks holding thousands of gallons of gasoline—either above ground or below ground—are permitted in the cm zoning where the facility is located i would like to hear from the planning board the definitive answer on that particular question and must ask why our elected representatives are not asking such questions themselves ups has been deceptive on the number of parking spaces they are adding saying at times  but pointing out a space lot and a space lot again i would like to hear from the planning board what they believe the exact number of parking spots that will be created and again must ask why our elected representatives are not asking such questions on behalf of the neighborhood according to the presentation ups actually hopes to eliminate jobs by establishing this facility specifically they hope to eliminate  drivers see page  the evidence suggests that ups hopes to displace older rundown facilities in elmsford and the bronx for example it appears ups would remove all the green space that remains to add parking spaces see page  at a meeting of the yonkers planning commission on july   the facility’s property owners who still own the property confirmed their commitment as a condition to build the hampton inn that they will never develop the remaining green space again i would like to hear from the planning board some of whom were members at that time why they are not requiring the property owner to honor that commitment and again must ask why our elected representatives are not protecting their constituents by blocking this development the plan also calls for a middle turn lane added on tuckahoe road this will especially have an impact on grassy sprain village the additional traffic will cause traffic tieups on tuckahoe road between two street lights that are one city block long apart has the yonkers fire department been asked to look at this plan and if not why havent their advice and consent been sought such an expansion as this would normally require an environmental impact report under the circumstances why is the planning board approving this without requiring an environmental impact report the activity of  tractor trailersday beginning at am and  ups package trucks throughout the day will have a huge impact on traffic safety and the belief that a sound wall will mitigate the noise is downright laughable—it will be as effective against sound and pollution as it would be against a virus again why is not an environmental impact report being requested what about the air quality of the neighborhood there are many other reasons i oppose this development and i believe the majority of residents also oppose this development it is a sad state affairs that the government and the board is steamrolling this development through without giving the neighbors the proper opportunity to respond,1

what does it take to defeat don blankenship in a west virginia republican primary race for us senate it requires the mitch mcconnellcontrolled republican senatorial committee to spend nearly  million running negative false ads against him it requires every major national television network—and even president trump’s son—to slanderously label him a felon it requires five republican us senators to endorse an opponent even with all that it still requires presiden  t trump himself to urge west virginians not to vote for don these media clippings which show the national media falsely labeling don a felon will likely be brushed off by some as just “politics in fact they may even be totally ignored by the media but the story these clippings tell is a frightening one sure they show that the media and politicians lied in order to advance their establishment ideals—no surprise there yes calling don a felon is a blatant lie doing so in the days leading up to the most watched race in the nation however is corruption in its truest form the washington establishment and the media have shown what they are capable of doing to protect themselves they will collude to spread any lie necessary to protect and maintain a government and an establishment that benefits the elitists and punishes average americans notwithstanding the fact that their actions will inevitably bankrupt america this is the same reason don was sent to a prison housing only felons as a mere misdemeanant this is the same reason that don was charged with felony crimes which the department of justice doj knew he did not commit this is the same reason that the truth about the upper big branch ubb mine has been hidden for eight years and why the government destroyed ubb documents and refuses to release doj internal reports related to the corrupt prosecution of don it does not take columbo or scotland yard to figure out what is going on here patrick morrisey is just another corrupt politician he settles west virginia lawsuits for pennies on the dollar—lawsuits worth millions of dollars that were filed against opiate distributing drug companies before he even came to west virginia—yet he parades around as the champion of the demise of the opiate industry meanwhile the opiate industry praises him hires his family to lobby on their behalf and provides the income his family depends on these companies were so happy to cheer on his arrival in west virginia they even paid for his inaugural party i don’t believe there is a single candidate who ran for the west virginia republican party senate nomination who will vote for patrick morrisey why we got to know him well and we know we owe it to our fellow west virginians to do better than morrisey,1

part  of  effort for privatization of medicare before diving into part  i want to make it clear that the nrln knows how important low cost ma plans are to retirees we are not saying don’t buy one but… those in congress who have supported subsidizing them also push the premium support plan and it calls for phasing out ma plans and forcing retirees to choose another nonsubsidized private plan or switch back to traditional medicare plan which likely will look much differe  nt therefore our first goal is to make sure that current and future ma plan enrollees maintain their eligibility to switch to traditional medicare and second that the nrln lobby to protect or grandfather ma plan enrollees from losing the low cost advantage they can buy now ma plans have been the private plan trojan horse designed to sneak privatization in and medicare out now on to part  of our three part series in april  the centers for medicare and medicaid cms broke the mold when it announced it would expand how it defined primary healthrelated benefits for medicare advantage ma plans cms will increase taxpayer funded capitation payments to ma plan insurers by an average of  percent about  billion in  allowing them to offer more benefits that’s well above the  percent bump cms initially proposed and higher than the  percent increase for  these are “federal door prizes” awarded to new ma plan enrollees by hhs management hoping the ma model will reduce health care costs this is shocking because it is not an incentive program and is very expensive to taxpayers simply a gift to insurers wanting to lure new enrollees during the  open enrollment period new ma offerings will include safety adaptations to a patient’s home air conditioners for seniors with asthma transportation to medical appointments or an emergency room healthy groceries and homedelivered meals etc these added benefits are not available to traditional medicare participants if these taxpayer benefits are proven to lower costs why would they not be offered to the  million in traditional medicare data from the  medicare trustees kaiser family foundation and cms reports show that in  the average cost for each of  million enrollees in traditional medicare part a amp part b was  the  million ma plan participant costs for medical services a and b were  per enrollee this data shows that it is less costly per enrollee to provide health care coverage for participants in traditional medicare than in ma plans subsidies rebates and quality rewards are included in ma plan costs if so why would there be too costly efforts underway to reduce healthcare costs why not attack costs within traditional medicare one program aimed at all medicare benefits there is no consensus among studies that medicare advantage plans are more cost effective than traditional medicare the october  cbo report sent to the house budget committee reported that the projected results for medicare premium support or privatization using the ma plan model would lower net federal payments to all medicare beneficiaries by  percent in  however total payments by all medicare affected beneficiaries would rise by  percent this is cost shifting not cost improvement watch for part  of  nrln’s proposals to congress on medicare advantage bill kadereit president national retiree legislative network and we need your committed support to nrln action alerts wwwnrlnorgsehtml contribute to nrln’s lobby effort wwwnrlnorgccdirecthtm make a taxdeductible donation to our american retirees education foundation aref research wwwseniorsareforgdonationshtml,1

eight years ago our state’s humanity came under attack vote tuesday  to restore wisconsin to a place where elected leaders have the strength to protect our schools environment and kindness no matter how big of a campaign donation offered —to promote sharing until sunday — worth of good spices amp kindness just  all of us who grew up in the state of wisconsin grew up in a place we could be proud of a strong economy based on quality public education a  university system that rivaled the nation’s best a pro environmental voice heard around the country and around the world and behind all this was the intentional kindness and caring of our state’s people the wisconsin of our youth was a gift given to us by all those who came before that we were obliged to pass on to all those who came after then came the  election the republican party chose wisconsin to be the test ground for all that unlimited political spending could do the very same forces that paved the way for what happened nationally in  first tested it all out here before the president grabbed the reins it was our governor testing out the attack on education selling out the environment and even testing the staged racism towards native americans we must address what is happening in the white house but just removing the tip of the iceberg changes pretty much nothing for real change we must also address the source and that’s up to us the wisconsin voters penzeys is a wisconsin business and a national business too as a yearold just starting penzeys i thought it would have been easier if my grandparents had chosen a city a little more in the spotlight today i’m convinced if we had been planted anywhere else finding our way to the business we’ve become would have only been harder human kindness really is universal but growing up in my parents’ spice store on rd amp galena through our customers i was given the chance to witness a kindness that was also intentional through them i learned when you take the time to care about others the world becomes a better place that’s a very milwaukee and very wisconsin idea the fact is wisconsin wasn’t randomly chosen out of a hat as the test ground for what unlimited political spending could do we were chosen because of our history wisconsin created the republican party as a force against slavery milwaukee has long embraced compassionate capitalism if unlimited media buys and the anger of the right wing echo machine could unravel a century of wisconsin support for education and the environment here it could be repeated everywhere so they set off to vilify teachers and turn suburban voters against public education for a  property tax cut then they went after our state’s proud history of environmental protection for nothing more than their own campaign contributions at first our desire to see goodness in everyone had us thinking this was just a brandnew governor in over his head but as time went on and this all only escalated we saw how incredibly organized the money behind all this was in time we came to realize there was no goodness here at all only the stripmining of the public good to give more to those who were already the wealthiest of the wealthy there was the thought in  that our now president with his lack of conscience and willingness to sell out all that is good for his own advancement somehow surprised the republican party we here in wisconsin have learned the hard way these are the very leadership values they’ve built their new party model around january   the day after the inauguration the day of the first woman’s march many nationally were pleasantly surprised that a wisconsin spice business had a symbol that so closely embraced the feelings that had them marching in our kind heart pin and in the words “kindness can’t sit down simply because anger has stood up” testing grounds work both ways while wisconsin was the trial run for what the republicans have now become nationally we were pushing back against their efforts time and again we found when they go after education minority rights the environment healthcare for those in need or even now in their taking of children from parents legally seeking asylum what they are really trying to do is erode our common decency and our shared humanity for them to win they need us to stop caring in studying their blueprints what we’ve found is that their death star has no defense against human compassion our kindness is our strength please use this knowledge any way you can this tuesday in wisconsin it’s this message of kindness we must share and continue to share across the nation through november  and onward to november   in wisconsin it is time for someone with the strength and courage to stand up to outside money no matter the size of the check to be voted the opportunity to govern thankfully there are many with this strength and courage on tuesday’s ballot if you are in wisconsin and would like to know more about how and where to vote please click this link,1

this is us taking pride in our diverse family in today’s culture diversity is a word that is thrown around frequently especially when it comes to politics and newscasters it is my belief that there is much more acceptance of diversity than many people actually see or are even willing to acknowledge as an example i would ask that you take a look at my family for that matter i challenge you to look at many of the families in our own delaware county there is much more t  han meets the eye at first glance yes my husband gary is likely one of the white anglo saxon protestants we read about in our history books but for a man who grew up poor in what was then a small town in oklahoma he has a great world view much of that comes from paying his own way through college by working  hours a week during school and more in the summer hauling hay and picking okra for as long as i have known him gary has had an open mind to new ideas and to acceptance of all kinds of people first of all gary married me maybe i look the part of all white america but i am particularly proud of my native american heritage unlike one particular presidential candidate i can prove my heritage my maternal grandfather was born in indian territory what is now oklahoma to a full blood cherokee mother unfortunately my great grandmother had to register with the tribe as a half breed just so she would be able to sell her land so i am now registered as  cherokee when i should be ⅛ i wish i had learned more about that side of the family when people were alive to tell me but as is too often the case hindsight is  i am also half german my paternal grandparents were first generation americans who always loved their country with lots of problems in trying to have children our first child was adopted valerie was five days old and absolutely beautiful oh did i mention she was also biracial at that time oklahoma was still considered a bible belt state not many people went around mixing the races unless it was with native americans yes we encountered a few puzzled looks and a few questions from people we didn’t know but for the most part our daughter was accepted as a child of god who was going to be raised in a loving home and isn’t that what is most important for all of us five years later we were blessed with a biological child another girl who was just as beautiful of course this daughter is also registered with the cherokee tribe even if she looks a bit scandanavian with her blond hair and blue eyes our older daughter grew up and married a man who was also racially mixed their children are two of our treasures a grandson who is about my color a light brown and a granddaughter who is a beautiful tan color both children have their mom’s contagious smile and laugh like their mother they can win people over with their bright personalities our younger daughter has two handsome boys who also have her blond hair and blue eyes the boys are nine and seven and even though many people ask if they are twins they are as different as night and day yes the boys could be registered with the cherokees and are the last ones eligible in that line several years ago after the girls were grown we decided to adopt a boy because we were going to be older parents we were excluded from many adoption possibilities finally it all came down to guatemala our son had just turned three when he came to ohio about a year ago our son wanted to do one of those ancestry dna tests he was pleased to find out that he was nearly  mayan he turns  this july and is well on his way to becoming an electrician oftentimes we have had the whole family in a restaurant and i have wanted to ask the wait staff if they could identify who is related to whom add in one of my nephews who is married to a philippine woman and there is even more variety we are certainly a motley crew incorporating many of the shades seen in the graphic above but again does it really matter no we love and accept each other and that is what is important for those of you who think this family dynamic is uncommon i challenge you to be hyper observant the next time you are at one of our local kroger or department stores or the next time you attend a parade or festival in one of delaware county’s communities or first friday in delaware city or even visit the polaris mall or the tanger outlets you are going to see many families like ours maybe the difference between us and the newscasters is that we accept diversity as a part of everyday life we don’t have to make an issue of diversity because there isn’t one as the popular tv show title says “this is us” written by cathy merrell,1

lockwood task force shares big plans at a town hall meeting held over drinks at planet lockwood thursday night lockwood civic leaders unveiled plans for a new regional airport members of the task force dubbed “flyaway from the wood” say the service at billings logan international airport does not effectively meet the needs of the lockwood community “the wood has been treated like the fat smelly nd cousin of billings for too long and the airport is an example  of that  it’s all about billings to denver billings to minneapolis billings to seattle…lockwood is never even mentioned or considered” group spokesperson dick halfwhitson says “it’s all about priorities – our stance is that sidewalks sanitary sewer a high school those things are all well and good but our own airport could really put us in the phone book” critics of the plan say that even if all the proposed funding from other projects is directed to an airport it there will still be a shortfall of several million dollars support for the airport already named “woodport” runs deep in the lockwood community group secretarytreasurer john dickson echoed the sentiment that seemed to prevail at the meeting “hey as long as i don’t gotta pay for nothing i’m for everything” in what turned into a heated debate proponents of the plan say the deannexing lockwood from the united states is a critical step in achieving the financial independence necessary “for one thing citizens of the republic of lockwood will not pay income taxes and operating the airport will be less expensive than if it were in the united states because they’ll not be subject to faa regulations “instead of air traffic controllers we’ll be able to use volunteers the same folks who have been active as school crossing guards” he confirmed there is not truth to the rumor that a meth tax will be proposed to enhance project funding “we need to do all we can to be competitive with the united states so our tax laws need to be userfriendly” halfwhitson says the next meeting will take place on february  pm,1

i recently read an opinion article from the washington post about a plan conservatives have launched to pack our federal courts which could result in president trump adding twice as many lifetime members to the federal judiciary in the next  months  whereas president obama named only  judges in eight years the first part of the plan is one that has been ongoing since the senate republicans delayed the filling of as many judicial vacancies as they could in the last  two years of president obama’s presidency which left trump with  federal judicial vacancies to fill in the first nine months of trump’s term he nominated  judges to the federal trial and appellate courts compared to obama’s  with senate republicans pushing these nominees through as fast as possible they are even eliminating the yearold “blue slip” rule which allowed homestate senators to object to particularly problematic nominees according to this article these changes could mean that by sometime next year  in  cases filed in federal court could be heard by a judge picked by president trump the second part of the plan is one written by steven calabresi the cofounder of the federalist society in a paper where he proposes to pack the federal courts with a minimum of  and possibly as many as  newly created judicial positions under this plan the yearold federal judiciary would increase by  to  percent in a year this would mean that the judicial branch would come to consist of almost equal parts judges picked by the last nine presidents combined and judges picked by just one donald j trump the next part of calabresi’s plan is for congress to abolish  administrative law judgeships in federal regulatory agencies and replace them with  trumpselected judges who unlike current administrative law judges would serve for life this means that president trump could be replacing nonpartisan administrative law judges who had control environmental health and safety fair competition communications labor financial and consumer regulation with his own political appointees who would serve for life these changes could have farreaching adverse impacts on our judicial system since we could see the effects of president trump’s appointments for decades to come this could profoundly impact the outcomes in cases related to civil rights and civil liberties and in addition if trump continues his pattern of appointing more white male judges than any president in nearly  years it would roll back decades of progress in judicial diversity,1

in january of this past year my husband was walking across a busy intersection and was hit by a truck running a red light i will never forget that call from the icu ever the days weeks months that followed were tough today is tough the days ahead sometimes look the toughest running became a person to me i would work through everything in my head schedules decisions conversations next steps in the wee hours of the morning i would take off my tough veneer and cry  for miles and miles i would become stronger i would come back ready to face that day i would become a better person to help justin i tend to be stubborn and want to do it all on my own running was the only person i gave in to and let help me i’ve experienced setback after setback after setback a string of freak andor chronic “stuff” had me dns an embarrassing number of races races that were critical to achieving my dream races that i had worked months upon months for races that i wanted so bad i kept putting foot in front of the other literally in some of my darkest moments i would just think just get out of bed then do this then this i would use dr appts checkups therapy sessions as “hope” milestones i would cling on to those next checkpoints as my great ‘hope’…and i believe hope is what truly gets us through life if you have hope if you still have something that might just might turn the tide it keeps you moving forward and before you know it you’re climbing back up and then looking back and saying yes yes i am doing it ltcollapsegt running has given me all the benefits any ‘modern day medicine or modality’ could give and then some running has been the one constant in my life through many moves heartbreaks and life changes it gives me energy it helps me sleep better it reduces my anxiety gives me confidence gives me hope inspires me to help others rise but the biggest thing running has done for me is show me how strong and powerful my body and my mind can be i run in hoka for two reasons first and foremost what they stand for i love their stance on females and maternity for their elite athletes their openness and support for diversity and inclusion and their pride in leaving a sustainable footprint i love how hoka is a brand that stands for something and that is important to me secondly from a pure biomechanical standpoint hoka shoes have saved my career i went on a hardcore shoe journey with the help of fleet feet for about four months and hoka was the only shoe that had the right heel toe drop stability and weight my rotation of the clifton for recovery days arahi for  of my base mileage and the carbon x for speed workouts and racing has really been my recipe for success the owner of my local fleet feet bill galbraith has been like a second dad to me he took  ownership and commitment to figuring out the shoe issue with me even when it got painful never once getting annoyed just committed to the process on top that bill selflessly has been vested in my running dream my coach is remote so bill acted as a defacto coach for all my track workouts which meant am wakeup calls to stand and coachprovide splits before the sun rose all without question last bill was a rock for me when my husband was in a critical accident this year and my world turned upside down constantly checking in offering help here there and everywhere all these things enabled me to continue to train and chase down my dream tim paziora who works for bill is the local shoe guru he was the one who would watch my stride recommend shoes sizes widths etc his patience and deep understanding of the foot and mechanics literally saved my running career in addition tim is an incredible runner himself and would pace me every single tuesday for a hilly mid distance run in the wee hours of the morning fleet feet is a brand ultimately powered by people and my local fleet feet is an amazing representation of that and why i am very loyal to fleet feet – hoka one one fan carrie birthdavis from fleet feet scottsdale az  humansofhoka,1

I think you can still make a difference.,0
It doesn't take much to make a difference.,0

Think about that and from what you spend on candy and snacks can be money that goes to a child in real need.,0

"Well children ARE the targets, usually. It depends on the subject.",0
Well I totally disagree with advertising but I can understand why they need it.,0
It might make them feel inadequate when they don't have something.,0
"Speaking from the point of view of a company, advertising is far from harmful.",0
People wanted to keep up with the jones even before advertising existed.,0
"Participant2, why are you against advertising?",0
First I think that the main problem is social comparison because of advertising.,0
I think it can be harmful for example with advertising for drugs.,0
Advertising makes the internet free as in beer.,0
"Participant2, I think it is only harmful when people feel targeted. Isn't the purpose of advertising to showcase product?",0
Even if the drugs are tested before being on the market sometimes all the dangers are not known and people use the drugs because (thats not the only reason) og the ads and also because their doctor tell them it's goog for them. Problem is sometimes even the doctor is influenced by drugs companies.,0
"Lots of people are ill because of social comparison, social comparison creates mental disease, and adverts are to a certain extent the cause of social comparison.",0
It is left to the discretion of the viewer if he feels he is a target.,0
Doctors being influenced by drug companies is not related to advertising.,0
"Well, in general, there are too many advertisements in everyday life.",0
As opposed to before social media made it possible? I mean before that there were other forms of advertisement.,0
Companies of chemistry and of drugs are so powerful and dangerous with all the ad they provide concerning products they do not know enough.,0
Participant3 I agree.,0
Participant3 : I also think it's dangerous for comparison. And maybe it more obvious at school. children wants sometimes because the others have these thing because tv and ads convinced them it was good for them.,0
Yeah well it is a culture of materialism we have.,0
"I'm not so concerned about drugs advertising, I don't feel related to them.",0
And parents are without tools in front of ad.,0
I just ask the doctor what drugs to take.,0
You cannot help but compare yourself to others.,0
"Participant4, it 's perhaps because you have never been ill.",0
I think advertising is just aggravating the situation that was already there.,0
Drugs ad target everyone.,0
You mean \/¦4GR4 or something else ?,0
"Also, drug adds and toy ads are different :)",0
Totally ok with you Participant1.,0
"Yes, but advertisements tell children that they should have everything they want.",0
I don't see many drugs ads in everyday life.,0
"Not necessarily, Moderator1.",0
"Participant4: I think that's what I do too but I'm not so sure I am not influenced by a brand or another for the specie of drugs I needed, for example if there are some different drugs for the same ""illness"" I cant affirm I'm not influenced by the ads in my choice of which one I will buy.",0
"Yes, especially tv.",0
"Ads tell kids that they want THIS THING, not everything.",0
"There are drugs adverts on tv in public places, in lots of places actually.",0
Parents are supposed to teach moderation but they tend not to anymore.,0
"Well, advertising gives the impression, especially to children, that they can and should have everything they want. This makes people too interested in material things.",0
Congratulations Participant4. I know I am influenced even if I try to do not listen to drugs ads.,0
"Participant2 : if you wouldn't be able to distinguish between the drugs without ads, then what's the problem with ads influencing you ?",0
"Participant2, what do you think about advertising for kids?",0
Aren't drugs supposed to be prescribed by professionals?,0
"Moderator, you're hinting that advertising is making our society more and more materialistic.",0
Moderator and Participant4: and I think we should see if maybe the materialistic side was always there.,0
"Yes indeed, and I'm not so sure.",0
Moderator and Participant4: the ads are just making it worse?,0
About the fact that advertising is making our society more and more materialistic?,0
"People used to be preoccupied by afterlife, heaven, and stuff, Participant1.",0
Yeah ok.,0
"Yeah well god is dead, long live money and stuff.",0
"Ok. even If i don t like ads ( and I hide them with an ad blocker on the web) I know that some people ""need"" ads to subsidize their internet website.",0
I mean people always collected objects of art and stuff. Those are the possessions of someone. Hell. animals collect things too. We are all materialistic.,0
Yes we are all materialistic but more or less.,0
Ads help many people hosting free stuff on the internet.,0
We can be materialistic without ads.,0
Participant2: yes we can and yes we are!,0
Ads make us (as a population) more materialistic imho.,0
Ads have the advantage to create jobs.,0
"Ads are only a way to aggravate it :) you know, for the profit of companies.",0
Ads are helpful and harmful.,0
It helps our economy.,0
Ads are helpful and harmful.,0
Ads are not harmful.,0
In short ads are more harmful than helpful.,0
I think it s harmful and worse It s insidious because they try to prove they are not harmful even if they know they are.,0
Yes Participant2 they are quite insidious.,0
"The topic of the second debate is whether religion does more harm than good. The last few years have seen a renewed enthusiasm for atheism and secularism in much of the world and debates between believers and non-believers have become ever more vigorous. One distinction that is frequently made, particularly by theists, is that between faith and religion. Whether such a distinction is meaningful or relevant does not fall within the purview of this debate, which focusses entirely on religion in the ordinary meaning of the word. In addition it will focus primarily on the Abrahamic religions (Christianity, Islam and Judaism) purely on the basis that they represent the largest of the world’s religious traditions. Participants, what do you think about the topic of the debate? Please formulate your opinions.",0
And nowadays we have always bad news from religion conflicts.,0
But people prefer to fight against the others to prove that their god is the strongest.,0
Science without consciousness is the ruin of soul.,0
Science and religion are additional too.,0
Science uses concrete things and the religion the people's imagination.,0
