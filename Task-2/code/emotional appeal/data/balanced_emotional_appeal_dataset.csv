about the recent defacing of the swinging bridge  graffiti is actually a terrible quality of life crime just one instance if not dealt with immediately and severely can spawn lots of imitation with the resulting civic squalor not far behind  i hope the city after its investigation removes this as soon as possible im told that few things are more frustrating to vandals than to have their handiwork disappear quickly  depending on the cost to make repairs this could wind up being a class c felony that means up to ten years in prison given what the bridge means to charles city historically and emotionally i do not think throwing the book at the perp would be resisted by too many  let me get this right one of the goals  if not the primary goal  of blm is achieving scrupulously fair and equal treatment of black suspects at the arrest bond trial and punishment phases of the criminal justice system the argument which enjoys near universal support around rural iowa as far i can tell is that equal protection means equal protection doesnt it undermine that message then for supporters of this message to show themselves to be willing to commit open flagrant intentional and largely needless felonies to promote the cause in fact doesnt committing felonies like this give support to the argument that people holding this view point are more likely to engage in felonies than people not holding this view point in other words wouldnt a strong letter to the editor of the cc press be more effective while not weakening a good argument  it sure would be nice if some prominent local supporters of blm would step up and denounce this criminal behavior my personal opinion is that denouncing criminal behavior enhances the blm argument and advances the cause of equality in the justice system i still find it hard to believe that someone actually did this,1

eight years ago our state’s humanity came under attack vote tuesday  to restore wisconsin to a place where elected leaders have the strength to protect our schools environment and kindness no matter how big of a campaign donation offered —to promote sharing until sunday — worth of good spices amp kindness just  all of us who grew up in the state of wisconsin grew up in a place we could be proud of a strong economy based on quality public education a  university system that rivaled the nation’s best a pro environmental voice heard around the country and around the world and behind all this was the intentional kindness and caring of our state’s people the wisconsin of our youth was a gift given to us by all those who came before that we were obliged to pass on to all those who came after then came the  election the republican party chose wisconsin to be the test ground for all that unlimited political spending could do the very same forces that paved the way for what happened nationally in  first tested it all out here before the president grabbed the reins it was our governor testing out the attack on education selling out the environment and even testing the staged racism towards native americans we must address what is happening in the white house but just removing the tip of the iceberg changes pretty much nothing for real change we must also address the source and that’s up to us the wisconsin voters penzeys is a wisconsin business and a national business too as a yearold just starting penzeys i thought it would have been easier if my grandparents had chosen a city a little more in the spotlight today i’m convinced if we had been planted anywhere else finding our way to the business we’ve become would have only been harder human kindness really is universal but growing up in my parents’ spice store on rd amp galena through our customers i was given the chance to witness a kindness that was also intentional through them i learned when you take the time to care about others the world becomes a better place that’s a very milwaukee and very wisconsin idea the fact is wisconsin wasn’t randomly chosen out of a hat as the test ground for what unlimited political spending could do we were chosen because of our history wisconsin created the republican party as a force against slavery milwaukee has long embraced compassionate capitalism if unlimited media buys and the anger of the right wing echo machine could unravel a century of wisconsin support for education and the environment here it could be repeated everywhere so they set off to vilify teachers and turn suburban voters against public education for a  property tax cut then they went after our state’s proud history of environmental protection for nothing more than their own campaign contributions at first our desire to see goodness in everyone had us thinking this was just a brandnew governor in over his head but as time went on and this all only escalated we saw how incredibly organized the money behind all this was in time we came to realize there was no goodness here at all only the stripmining of the public good to give more to those who were already the wealthiest of the wealthy there was the thought in  that our now president with his lack of conscience and willingness to sell out all that is good for his own advancement somehow surprised the republican party we here in wisconsin have learned the hard way these are the very leadership values they’ve built their new party model around january   the day after the inauguration the day of the first woman’s march many nationally were pleasantly surprised that a wisconsin spice business had a symbol that so closely embraced the feelings that had them marching in our kind heart pin and in the words “kindness can’t sit down simply because anger has stood up” testing grounds work both ways while wisconsin was the trial run for what the republicans have now become nationally we were pushing back against their efforts time and again we found when they go after education minority rights the environment healthcare for those in need or even now in their taking of children from parents legally seeking asylum what they are really trying to do is erode our common decency and our shared humanity for them to win they need us to stop caring in studying their blueprints what we’ve found is that their death star has no defense against human compassion our kindness is our strength please use this knowledge any way you can this tuesday in wisconsin it’s this message of kindness we must share and continue to share across the nation through november  and onward to november   in wisconsin it is time for someone with the strength and courage to stand up to outside money no matter the size of the check to be voted the opportunity to govern thankfully there are many with this strength and courage on tuesday’s ballot if you are in wisconsin and would like to know more about how and where to vote please click this link,1

animal rights and animal welfare – know the difference there is a big difference between animal rights and animal welfare and it needs to be clarified the american veterinary medical association has taken a formal position defining the difference between the two labels animal rights vs animal welfare in their detailed policy on animal welfare and animal rights they state that they cannot endorse the views of animal rights groups here’s a quote from their policy “animal  rights is a philosophical view and personal value characterized by statements by various animal rights groups animal welfare and animal rights are not synonymous terms the avma wholeheartedly endorses and adopts promotion of animal welfare as official policy however the avma cannot endorse the philosophical views and personal values of animal rights advocates when they are incompatible with the responsible use of animals for human purposes such as food fiber and research conducted for the benefit of both humans and animals” let’s take a closer look at the fundamental differences between animal welfare and the animal rights philosophy animal welfare – animal welfare includes all animals whether used for food companionship or sport it is based on a principle of ownership of animals it reflects a common sense approach that animals should be treated well and that animal cruelty is wrong animal welfare standards and guidelines for animal use and management are based on sound veterinary and animal husbandry experience research and practices the avma views animal welfare as a “…human responsibility that encompasses all aspects of animal wellbeing including proper housing management nutrition disease prevention and treatment responsible care humane handling and when necessary humane euthanasia” it also means animals that provide for human needs experience no unnecessary suffering animal rights  animal rights advocates and their groups believe in the ideology that there is no distinction between animals and humans they view animal ownership as exploitation and slavery the true goal of animal rights groups is to work for legislation and humane care only until all animals are no longer owned or utilized by human beings the ncraoa north carolina responsible animal owners alliance has described what animal rights groups are all about and their activities “animal rights groups exploit our love of animals to work for various types of restrictive legislation limit laws breed specific legislation mandatory spayneuter as well as laws that are steps toward changing the legal status of animals as property” and “the animal rights movement is about control not animal welfare supporting legislation based on emotion and philosophical interpretation provides a platform in our legal system for incremental increases toward animal status changes” lately we have been accused of being against the proper care and husbandry of animals this has happened because over the years we have been working hard to shed light on extremist animal rights groups we have exposed their activities and their agenda they are afraid the public will finally realize they are staging a dramatic impact on the rights and way of life of all americans since they are feeling threatened and are afraid of exposure they have fought back against us they have called us the “bad guy” and much worse while doing this they have conveniently blurred the definition of animal rights which both confuses and misleads the public they accuse us of being “antianimal” and “against animals” we have even been accused of “hating horses” and benefiting from killing them these accusations are not even close to the truth they are outright fabrications folks who are affiliated and work with protect the harvest have pets and a number also have horses and livestock we care about animals we care about their health and wellbeing we practice and support animal welfare while these outright falsehoods that have been launched against us create more work and some challenges for us it also shows that we are making progress in short we support animal welfare but we are against animal rights taking a stand against animal rights in no way means that we do not care about animals or their welfare we do care or we would not be investing time money and a whole lot of effort in educating the public about protecting our rights animal ownership agriculture and our heritage to stay informed sign up for our newsletter httpprotecttheharvestcomnewslettersignup,1
we all love the story of hanukkah the maccabees the oil the miracle but long before the miraculous jug of oil defined the holiday hanukkah was already called the festival of lights this is because hanukkah is about finding light in the darkness about coming out the other side of difficult times providing a glimmer a hope when all seems lost at j street we work on a difficult prolonged conflict and it can feel sometimes like we are moving further from a solution  p  articularly given the reckless policies of the trump administration but we cup our hands around the light protecting the beacon of peace from those who wish to extinguish it for those of us who care about israel and know both israelis and palestinians deserve peace and security there is no giving up our work is making a difference weve transformed congress electing proisrael members who are not afraid to express disagreements with pm netanyahu and fight for our propeace mission together well stand against trump and his farright enablers and secure a bright future for all your support feeds the fire that guides us forward happy hanukkah,1

good day jefferson county residents my name is keith cook and i am running for county commissioner for district  i am a registered republican a constitutional conservative i believe in small government low taxes and a government doing more with less by managing resources responsibly the government has the responsibility to the taxpayers to not spend their money recklessly or frivolously it is the responsibility of elected officials to vote on topics in a timely manne  r thereby reducing the cost of readdressing the issue time and again if conservative leadership traits are followed by elected officials in fulfilling their responsibilities to their constituents the results will invariably be effective and efficient government saving valuable tax dollars having lived in jefferson county for  years and deeply rooted in the community we are blessed to live in a closeknit place with such great friends my family and i are members of the first united methodist church of monticello my extended family has enjoyed a history in the thomas county ga area for the last  years having a professional background in the electric utility industry with over  years experience has taught me a great deal about all types of construction crafts my knowledge skills and abilities in budgetary issues administration and management further enhance my qualifications my previous positions provide me with the experience to assess situations and make timely decisions prior to working in the electric utility industry i was a land surveyor this knowledge gave me hands on experience in property rights easements and right of ways having had some excellent mentors in these fields provides me a solid background to serve on the commission my leadership skills in dealing with people in an honest and forthright manner are time tested being goal oriented will enable me to be an outspoken advocate for the people in district  i would like to take this opportunity to answer the questions that the county commission candidates were asked at the forum on  question  “how would you bring economic development to our county” we can advertise jefferson county as a retirement destination building small retirement communities within jefferson county with the hopes of pulling retirees from around the country when you look at other counties around the state that have done this it generates millions in revenue this would allow our community to grow without losing the small town atmosphere question  “name a specific way to save the county money” we could employ fulltime grant writer to be shared with the sheriff’s department city council and county commission question  “is the millage rate for the county sufficient for what needs to be done” yes it is provided that the commission manages the resources properly question  “how would you do a better job of preparing the budget” i’m not sure we need to do a better job preparing the budget we need to plan for short term and long term goals which includes a plan for saving we need to prioritize our spending needs what are fixed expenses and what are flexible expenses we need to be good stewards of our finances question  “how would you develop the lloyd interchange” advertise the advantages in jefferson county over leon county as a less costly county to build your home jefferson county has lower taxes and fewer restrictions the lloyd interchange would be the most likely place for this to have an impact question  “would you borrow money for county infrastructure development” no i would not borrow money for county development infrastructure i would look for grants and apply a  impact fee on all new home construction question  “what is the purpose for building “a”” it has cost the tax payers over  million dollars in grant money to date and is still incomplete the original bid was  million dollars who on the county commission was responsible for the budget oversight thank you for your time and consideration your vote for me as county commissioner district  is deeply appreciated if you have any questions please call me at  keithcookdistrictgmailcom political advertisement paid for and approved by keith cook npa for county commissioner district,1

celebrate kavanaugh victory with a voting party surreal we just went through a very unsettling but clarifying event democrats and the media were revealed in all their nastiness and opposition to the basic tenets of justice it was and is unsettling but it was also clarifying the venom was spewed not at trump but at a main stream republican judge with a stellar career and not a whiff of scandal during his long public service this is not trump derangement syndrome but is much broader that’s important for everyone to consider the war is not between trump and the progressives but the progressives and those committed to the american republic and its basic principles of liberty and justice for those who thought the rancor from the left was against trump but not main stream republicans that illusion went out the window fullthroated attacks were and are being aimed at a bush main stream republican the left is clearly waging amoral war on all things nonprogressive and against the foundations of western civilization such as the rule of law it is truly frightening but another point of clarification one about strategy was also evident we learned how to win the way to effectively combat the attacks on our culture is to fight back hard again this is not an allusion to trump fighting back but to judge kavanaugh and the republican senators we learned how to win we need to press forward for one more month this event ended in victory through the addition of a constitutionalist to the us supreme court a bullet was dodged and that’s exhilarating we should rejoice in the win but remembering how this win happened we should also throw ourselves into the ongoing political warfare that is now clearly raging around us so we suggest you bring celebration and work together by having a voting party ballots here in oregon will be mailed next week invite some friends together at your home or church to discuss the candidates and issues and mark your ballots you know what’s at stake and will be voting a voting party is a way to encourage your friends and relatives to vote as well and have fun at the same time peapac’s biblical ballot measure voters guide will also be in the mail next week if you’re not on our mailing list go to peapacorg and give us your address and let us know how many guides you’d like oregon’s vote by mail system is a great opportunity to get together talk through the issues and candidates and encourage one another to vote remember good folks may disagree at points and that’s okay but have some fun get some work done and encourage others,1

i recently read an opinion article from the washington post about a plan conservatives have launched to pack our federal courts which could result in president trump adding twice as many lifetime members to the federal judiciary in the next  months  whereas president obama named only  judges in eight years the first part of the plan is one that has been ongoing since the senate republicans delayed the filling of as many judicial vacancies as they could in the last  two years of president obama’s presidency which left trump with  federal judicial vacancies to fill in the first nine months of trump’s term he nominated  judges to the federal trial and appellate courts compared to obama’s  with senate republicans pushing these nominees through as fast as possible they are even eliminating the yearold “blue slip” rule which allowed homestate senators to object to particularly problematic nominees according to this article these changes could mean that by sometime next year  in  cases filed in federal court could be heard by a judge picked by president trump the second part of the plan is one written by steven calabresi the cofounder of the federalist society in a paper where he proposes to pack the federal courts with a minimum of  and possibly as many as  newly created judicial positions under this plan the yearold federal judiciary would increase by  to  percent in a year this would mean that the judicial branch would come to consist of almost equal parts judges picked by the last nine presidents combined and judges picked by just one donald j trump the next part of calabresi’s plan is for congress to abolish  administrative law judgeships in federal regulatory agencies and replace them with  trumpselected judges who unlike current administrative law judges would serve for life this means that president trump could be replacing nonpartisan administrative law judges who had control environmental health and safety fair competition communications labor financial and consumer regulation with his own political appointees who would serve for life these changes could have farreaching adverse impacts on our judicial system since we could see the effects of president trump’s appointments for decades to come this could profoundly impact the outcomes in cases related to civil rights and civil liberties and in addition if trump continues his pattern of appointing more white male judges than any president in nearly  years it would roll back decades of progress in judicial diversity,1

lockwood task force shares big plans at a town hall meeting held over drinks at planet lockwood thursday night lockwood civic leaders unveiled plans for a new regional airport members of the task force dubbed “flyaway from the wood” say the service at billings logan international airport does not effectively meet the needs of the lockwood community “the wood has been treated like the fat smelly nd cousin of billings for too long and the airport is an example  of that  it’s all about billings to denver billings to minneapolis billings to seattle…lockwood is never even mentioned or considered” group spokesperson dick halfwhitson says “it’s all about priorities – our stance is that sidewalks sanitary sewer a high school those things are all well and good but our own airport could really put us in the phone book” critics of the plan say that even if all the proposed funding from other projects is directed to an airport it there will still be a shortfall of several million dollars support for the airport already named “woodport” runs deep in the lockwood community group secretarytreasurer john dickson echoed the sentiment that seemed to prevail at the meeting “hey as long as i don’t gotta pay for nothing i’m for everything” in what turned into a heated debate proponents of the plan say the deannexing lockwood from the united states is a critical step in achieving the financial independence necessary “for one thing citizens of the republic of lockwood will not pay income taxes and operating the airport will be less expensive than if it were in the united states because they’ll not be subject to faa regulations “instead of air traffic controllers we’ll be able to use volunteers the same folks who have been active as school crossing guards” he confirmed there is not truth to the rumor that a meth tax will be proposed to enhance project funding “we need to do all we can to be competitive with the united states so our tax laws need to be userfriendly” halfwhitson says the next meeting will take place on february  pm,1

did you know that right now the timeshare giants are fighting hard to outlaw the entire timeshare cancellation industry at first glance this seems insane considering the timeshare cancellation industry exists to help timeshare owners who have been lied to and misled escape horrific amp binding timeshare contracts who wouldn’t want that however when considered for a moment it makes a lot of sense but we’ll talk more about this in a moment for now i want to ask you a s  ingle question would you still own your timeshare if you had had a  hour “grace period” to decide whether or not you should buy the timeshare let me explain most timeshare pitches are incredibly high pressure and you must decide whether or not you will buy the same day you do a timeshare tour they often mislead you into thinking that they are offering an incredible deal but this deal only lasts for that day “if you leave today you won’t be able to buy again at this price” first this is a lie second the only reason they do this is to pressure you to buy it is one of the many common lies that we hear everyday working with our clients which is why we feel it is so critical to ensure the timeshare owner is represented and protected by the timeshare cancellation industry if you don’t already know me my name is chuck mcdowell and i am the father of the timeshare cancellation industry and this isn’t the first time the timeshare industry has tried to bully me several years ago i was sued for  million by the largest timeshare company in the world they were not very happy when i defeated them in federal court i stood my ground when others shut their doors because i knew there were millions of timeshare owners who had been lied to during their timeshare experience i also knew if i folded to the timeshare giant’s demands they would never stop taking advantage of timeshare owners yet again myself and wesley financial group are having to stand up to the timeshare giants to protect timeshare owners as i mentioned before right now the timeshare giants are trying to sneak legislation that would outlaw the entire timeshare cancellation industry they want to make it illegal to help timeshare owners this would be devastating for the millions of timeshare owners who have been lied to and mislead during their timeshare experience we are going to fight their legislation tooth and nail because we know it is the right thing to do if you own timeshare here’s what i ask first answer the question from earlier would you have still purchased your timeshare if you had had a  hour “grace period” to decide whether or not you should purchase the timeshare why or why not second if you’d like to learn if you could qualify for timeshare cancellation we have a short quiz that thousands of timeshare owners have already taken in this quiz you’ll find out if there’s a chance we can help you plus you’ll learn a bit about us and why we exist and finally if there’s a good chance you might qualify we’ll send you a package in the mail that will teach you everything you need to know about how to get rid of your timeshare once and for all i founded this industry because i knew there were good people stuck in bad situations wesley financial group has grown to nearly  employees who come to work every day to help good timeshare owners who feel stuck in bad timeshare contracts we fight every day and we will continue to fight until every mislead timeshare owner has the opportunity to get out sincerely chuck mcdowell owner of wesley financial group “father of the timeshare cancellation industry”,1

"an open letter to constituents
hi my name is celeste yarbrough bayles
ive officially thrown my hat into the race to represent ward  place  on the homewood city council and i wanted to take a minute to properly introduce myself to the voters of west homewood
i was raised in homewood graduated from hhs in  and have decided to raise my family in this small town just over the mountain from the city of birmingham because it is home and while i might be new to politics i know from experience things people like and do not like about our city
in my professional life at employment screening services ess i manage a team in charge of over  million of client accounts during the current pandemic we continue to help both small businesses and large corporations continue to hire new staff even as the world seems to have stopped in its tracks this experience gives me a unique perspective on how to effectively navigate this pandemic from a business and management perspective
through my outreach with organizations like alabama women in business board member alabama possible youth board member and the birmingham business alliance mentor i have seen first hand how community outreach and effective leadership can change lives
i am running for these reasons
with the world feeling like it is on fire some days we need new leadership that will take us in a new direction
we need to get rid of the cliques and cronyism in city government this will create a more inclusive environment where all citizens feel they have input and do not have to know someone to get solutions to their problems
as the world we live in evolves around us i want to make sure the council reaches out to the community with uptodate information through all its channels the public needs to know how this pandemic is affecting our city and the status of important initiatives like the revitalization of the derelict hotel district on oxmoor road
i want to create a completely transparent city council in terms of city spending if youre paying taxes then you should at least get to know how theyre spent right
we need a city manager to improve efficiency i will move to install a qualified candidate so we can streamline the way our small government runs
i want to push to keep the city of homewood diverse and inclusive so that all citizens no matter what their background can feel welcome in our community inthistogether
thank you for the privilege of your time and i hope we will be able to get to know more about each other soon

this is us taking pride in our diverse family in today’s culture diversity is a word that is thrown around frequently especially when it comes to politics and newscasters it is my belief that there is much more acceptance of diversity than many people actually see or are even willing to acknowledge as an example i would ask that you take a look at my family for that matter i challenge you to look at many of the families in our own delaware county there is much more t  han meets the eye at first glance yes my husband gary is likely one of the white anglo saxon protestants we read about in our history books but for a man who grew up poor in what was then a small town in oklahoma he has a great world view much of that comes from paying his own way through college by working  hours a week during school and more in the summer hauling hay and picking okra for as long as i have known him gary has had an open mind to new ideas and to acceptance of all kinds of people first of all gary married me maybe i look the part of all white america but i am particularly proud of my native american heritage unlike one particular presidential candidate i can prove my heritage my maternal grandfather was born in indian territory what is now oklahoma to a full blood cherokee mother unfortunately my great grandmother had to register with the tribe as a half breed just so she would be able to sell her land so i am now registered as  cherokee when i should be ⅛ i wish i had learned more about that side of the family when people were alive to tell me but as is too often the case hindsight is  i am also half german my paternal grandparents were first generation americans who always loved their country with lots of problems in trying to have children our first child was adopted valerie was five days old and absolutely beautiful oh did i mention she was also biracial at that time oklahoma was still considered a bible belt state not many people went around mixing the races unless it was with native americans yes we encountered a few puzzled looks and a few questions from people we didn’t know but for the most part our daughter was accepted as a child of god who was going to be raised in a loving home and isn’t that what is most important for all of us five years later we were blessed with a biological child another girl who was just as beautiful of course this daughter is also registered with the cherokee tribe even if she looks a bit scandanavian with her blond hair and blue eyes our older daughter grew up and married a man who was also racially mixed their children are two of our treasures a grandson who is about my color a light brown and a granddaughter who is a beautiful tan color both children have their mom’s contagious smile and laugh like their mother they can win people over with their bright personalities our younger daughter has two handsome boys who also have her blond hair and blue eyes the boys are nine and seven and even though many people ask if they are twins they are as different as night and day yes the boys could be registered with the cherokees and are the last ones eligible in that line several years ago after the girls were grown we decided to adopt a boy because we were going to be older parents we were excluded from many adoption possibilities finally it all came down to guatemala our son had just turned three when he came to ohio about a year ago our son wanted to do one of those ancestry dna tests he was pleased to find out that he was nearly  mayan he turns  this july and is well on his way to becoming an electrician oftentimes we have had the whole family in a restaurant and i have wanted to ask the wait staff if they could identify who is related to whom add in one of my nephews who is married to a philippine woman and there is even more variety we are certainly a motley crew incorporating many of the shades seen in the graphic above but again does it really matter no we love and accept each other and that is what is important for those of you who think this family dynamic is uncommon i challenge you to be hyper observant the next time you are at one of our local kroger or department stores or the next time you attend a parade or festival in one of delaware county’s communities or first friday in delaware city or even visit the polaris mall or the tanger outlets you are going to see many families like ours maybe the difference between us and the newscasters is that we accept diversity as a part of everyday life we don’t have to make an issue of diversity because there isn’t one as the popular tv show title says “this is us” written by cathy merrell,1

"below is one of the questions in the rome newstribune is recent qa with the candidates for sheriff and i want to expand on my response since we were limited to  words
the reason being is that mental health and the lack of resources for those who need help is one of the biggest issues currently facing law enforcement that is because people in a mental health crisis are unfortunately more likely to encounter police and often end up in jail than to get medical assistance
q the jail medical facility is undergoing a major expansion to include a mental health wing how do you envision using it
a this splostfunded expansion is a step in the right direction to providing a safer environment for inmates and employees since the closing of northwest regional our jail has been flooded with people with mental illnesses and no access to resources we have been ill equipped to handle it we currently have four medical beds insufficient to say the least the new unit will bring that number closer to  new treatment programs will also be part of the expansion i thank the citizens of floyd county for recognizing this major need and voting yes to the  splost
i am also focused on promoting training i was one of the first in our agency and our area to seek out cit training and am also a certified crisis intervention instructor our deputies need this training to do their jobs effectively in fact i would love to see all local law enforcement agencies get more training in this area
i also want to point out that with such a major decline in the number of mental health facilities services and funding in our state over the years we are fortunate to have an organization like nami rome ga here to provide support education and advocacy other organizations doing great things to support people coping with a mental illness include elevation house livingproof recovery and nextdoor at livingproof recovery should i be elected i would look forward to collaborating with these organizations and others to find better solutions to this issue in our community
i hope that by creating a safer environment adding training for our staff and partnering with community organizations we can help some of these people with mental illnesses get on a healthier path instead of jail being a revolving door

what are the chances that the original front double doors to the blacksmith shop built when the a minchau blacksmith shop was erected in  would survive what are the chances that the doors would have been preserved in such good condition over the years see our post and picture from the edmonton journal dated june th already in the  is the a minchau blacksmith shop was recognized by the province of alberta for the important historical and economical value it  possessed and the royal alberta museum approached fred and stanley minchau asking if the museum could have the doors and in exchange the museum would supply them with a new set of doors this was in  and the doors were then on display for many years to come in the pioneer section of the museum with other notable pieces from that era that important historical value of the blacksmith shop has only increased and greatly as time has gone by and it has been a full  years since the doors were originally donated to the museum at the province is request half a century ago how fortunate we are as a city and as a province to have in our possession not only the original doors from the  blacksmith shop but also the original blacksmith shop itself typically it would be a reversed situation historical building is demolished we find an original piece or part of its structure that belongs to it people are captivated by its discovery but then are left to imagination to fill in the gaps of history we do not need to rely on our imagination in the case of the a minchau blacksmith shop built in  it still stands in its original form and in its original place of construction in the heart of old strathcona a vitally important cornerstone of our history and heritage and our economic and social growth is still intact and today needs our help in protecting it from demolition we believe that the alberta provincial government already understood the significant value of the a minchau blacksmith shop in  when they approached the blacksmith shop owners fred and stanley asking for the doors to be preserved in the provincial museum at the time the shop was in full operation and not needing a historical designation itself today it does we believe that the municipal government already understood the significant value of the a minchau blacksmith shop in  and further so in  as per official city of edmonton records the city of edmonton planning and development department selected a project team in  to identify significant buildings bridges landscapes cemeteries trees architectural fragments street furnishings and monuments the result was the register of historic resources in edmonton  which at the time was a list of  resources that merited conservation in  the register of historic resources in edmonton was presented to city council the a minchau blacksmith shop is on that inventory of historic resources unfortunately being on the register of historic resources in edmonton an inventory of historic resources that merit conservation does not save a historic heritage building from demolition this we now know to be a direct result of weak legislation on the part of the municipal government while these laws may be weak in protecting historical heritage sites to be sure they are strong and strident in favoring developers who seem to want more and concede less currently and as of may th edmonton city council has voted to have mayor don iveson officially approach the provincial government to assist in granting the a minchau blacksmith shop an official provincial heritage designation which would protect it from demolition see our post dated june nd kudos to the mayor and city council for taking this great step forward kudos to everyone who has written their elected government officials your voices are being heard and have helped support the municipal government is challenging decision municipal legislation needs to change now but today we need the province to step up we have the original blacksmith door we have the original blacksmith shop we do not as yet have the official designation to save this historical heritage building we are in a race to save our historical heritage buildings from being demolished please email and write the provincial government today the province has the legal power to designate an official heritage status which will protect the a minchau blacksmith shop from demolition and provide a place of living history for all to enjoy please send emails to culturetourismministergovabca ricardo miranda  minister of culture and tourism premiergovabca premier rachel notley in subject header for both write designate the minchau blacksmith shop official heritage status please let the provincial government know that you support an official registered designation for the a minchau blacksmith shop and that the minchau blacksmith shop represents a large part of our history and heritage and should be preserved please ask the provincial government to designate the a minchau blacksmith shop an official historical heritage site use as many or as few words as you would like to express your support for an official historical designation again a huge thank you to everyone who is following this page who are writing letters and to individuals who believe in saving our history and heritage if you have already sent an email to the provincial government we urge you

judicial primary elections cancelled at this time the nc senate passed a conference report known as the electoral freedom act of  this is a rather deceptive name for a bill which has eliminated the requirement for a primary election for any judges running for election in this state regardless of whether they are running for seats on the nc supreme court the nc court of appeals for superior courts or for district court judgeships normally candidates running for thes  e judgeships would have filed a notice of candidacy in february and they would have participated in primary elections held in may as it presently stands these candidates will not have to file a notice of candidacy until june th  and no later than pm on june th  there is also no requirement for a primary election typically when a primary election is held the  highest votegetters participate in the november general election however if no primary election is scheduled then you can end up with perhaps a dozen candidates running in a judicial contest and the candidate who wins could potentially receive only  of the vote which would be a rather startling outcome as it presently stands it appears that the general assembly will hold a special session in january to examine the possibility of adopting new judicial districts for our state for judges serving in our district and superior courts as well as for district attorneys at that time it is also possible that a constitutional amendment could be proposed that could be placed on the ballot for voters to consider as early as the may  primary which could result in the adoption of a new judicial appointmentsmerit selection process this new merit selection process could allow the republican majority in the general assembly to appoint judges in our state the constitutional amendment can also create what is known as judicial retention elections where a judge holding office would just be voted in or out of office but the person would not be running against another candidate all of this can have profound ramifications which i would encourage each of you to closely follow as this process moves forward it is essential that the public have confidence and trust in the integrity of our judges and in our judicial system we should clearly avoid any process that politicizes judges serving on our courts please continue to track this process i have been following it closely and some of the changes that have been proposed give me great concern there was absolutely no reason to cancel primaries for any candidate running for the nc supreme court or the nc court of appeals since those courts will not be impacted by the redrawing of judicial districts however they could be impacted if judicial retention elections are approved as a result of the passing of a constitutional amendment this is probably why they have canceled those primaries as well,1

that the electricity can be produced completely cofree after a few years of operation even the climate balance for the production and disposal of the solar modules at the end of their useful life is less harmful to the environment than with other systems for conventional power generation
there are almost  photovoltaic systems in vienna which together produce around  gwh of electricity annually this will supply almost  households with ecological electricity
in order to further expand this share and also to contribute to reducing the ecological footprint in the district we call for the nationwide expansion of photovoltaic modules the roof of the
the wiener linien tram depot on gudrunstrasse is ideally suited as an area for photovoltaic modules that is why we submitted an application to the district council on july   according to calculations up to  gwh of electricity per year can be produced there in this way around  households in favoriten could be supplied with environmentally friendly electricity our application is to be implemented as part of the renovation of the tram depot
both on public and private buildings if you are interested in installing a photovoltaic system on your own roof you can even apply for funding from the city of vienna
in vienna  of the roof areas are suitable for producing clean electricity there is still a lot of potential here to supply the city with green electricity especially on the roofs of public buildings in the district in combination with green roofs the ecological potential can be further exploited

"today i was disturbed to read that justin trudeau is political office has ordered canada is nonpartisan public service to do his political damage control
according to media reports officials from global affairs canada were ordered by the prime minister is office to pressure former career diplomat david mulroney who is now an academic and fellow at the university of toronto munk school to clear his public statements with the trudeau government the reason for this pressure was reportedly due to the election environment and therefore mr mulroney had to be very very careful
this exchange is highly inappropriate and represents a blatant attempt by justin trudeau to muzzle a respected former career diplomat trudeau has shown a clear pattern of silencing those who speak out
justin trudeau once said he admires china is basic dictatorship but this is not how things are done in canada
this also raises questions as to whether or not officials have been ordered by trudeau is pmo to speak with former ambassador to china and former trudeau cabinet minister john mccallum mr mccallum has made a number of inappropriate statements over the past year including his comments on canada is extradition process and his encouragement of chinese foreign interference in the upcoming election
as mr mulroney stated discouraging private citizens with expertise in foreign relations from speaking freely is fundamentally an undemocratic idea i could not agree more justin trudeau must answer for the many times he has exploited canada is nonpartisan public service for his own political purpose
justin trudeau promised to do politics differently but clearly he is not as advertised",1
