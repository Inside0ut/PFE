make welfare a safety net not a fishing net benjamin franklin once made the wise observation that we should make people uncomfortable in their poverty to encourage them to better their situation this statement was made when we were forming a new society and basically creating something out of nothing our society has grown and matured to a point where it is totally possible for someone to everything in their power and still not succeed simply because the corner of the mar  ket they can fill has been filled in their area or market forces have changed and they are not equipped to move with it with this growth we are in a position that it is possible to have a large percentage of the population participating in activities that are not necessarily adding to the economy but adding to society as a whole the modern incarnation of welfare is set up in a manner where when someone has fallen to a degree that they must call on the generosity of the welfare system they will almost always be soon faced to make a choice of cutting the net and going not having anything to fall back on if things go wrong or stay in the net and not have to worry this proposition is not only not fair but it dehumanizes the individual and makes them feel useless if they stay in but also stacks the deck against them and makes it almost impossible to succeed we no longer have to make people uncomfortable in their poverty but need to set up a system that less resembles a fishing net but instead is a safety net where they can start in the net and work themselves out of it at a pace where they are comfortable and learn at a pace that they can manage this system would also need to allow people to retire have adequate medical care and provide incentives participate in society this may seem like a far fetched dream but i actually envisioned a plan that would do this and more  years ago at the time nobody saw a need but in our current environment with most of the population facing reduced income i believe the time has come to reintroduce the idea the cornerstone of this plan is to establish a baseline where one could maintain a comfortable life style to find a tax baseline this amount would need to be doubled for every individual who is not claimed as a dependent on another is taxes every penny up to that amount would not be taxed for the purposes of this illustration let us say the tax baseline is  if an individual had no income they would receive  in monthly installments for the next year if a person made  outside the refund amount they would receive  this amount would be calculated by subtracting their income from  and they would get a rebate of half that amount so if someone made  they would get  this setup would allow everyone to pay for their living expenses even if they will not or cannot work and would keep people from gaming the system by collecting from multiple welfare programs while offering a chance to not get cut off completely while they work to better themselves in addition to the cornerstone there would be two classes of adjustment so that special circumstances could be taken care of the first class of adjustment would be adjustments to income certain expenses would be deductible so that if you had to spend money on medical expense for example these expenses could be subtracted from their income the second class of adjustment would be changing the tax baseline the two main ways this would be used are to cover for social security being discontinued and to give incentive for people to pursue occupations such as teaching being a doctor or other less than appealingdifficult occupations i mentioned social security in the last paragraph for those that have paid into social security they would still get their checks but it would lower their tax baseline by the amount of the benefit received and eventually be phased out it may have occurred to you that this system could be very expensive the aspect that could make up for the bottom end of the income spectrum is those who is income surpassed the tax baseline if someone had an income of  only the income above the baseline would be taxable but it would be taxed at a rate of  so this person would have a tax bill of  which would be an effective rate of  for the well off this would still be a tax rate close to what they are paying today ive said that a tax bill is a rich man is playground the more involved a law is the more room is has for loopholes exceptions and possibilities for fraud by simplifying the laws the increases in payouts to those on the lower end of the spectrum would be made up for the wealthy who would have fewer exceptions and higher tax bills this outline is not complete mainly due to a desire to not write for the next  hours lol there would need to be stipulations for the disabled retired individuals veterans and many other groups that deserve special attention the main thing is to point out that there are options and a complete overhaul to repeal and replace our existing tax code is not unrealistic addition a couple people have asked me what is wrong with the fair tax i have read some information about the fair tax and i did not have to read very far to see what my main objection would be the fair tax adds an extremely high sales tax to nonessential purchases my plan does eliminate all payroll taxes including social security it also allows adjustments for medical expenses i did not include the idea of a debit card in my original writing but the card could be used for qualifying medical expenses for those with medical conditions as a means to cover expenses that would be covered under the plan i am not in favor of socialized medicine but i do believe a two tier system where basic care would be free while those who can afford advanced care could have insurance or pay cash for it,1

a new study by the thomas b fordham institute which is an education reform think tank found that there is a large gap between the number of white students when compared to the number of black and hispanic students in gifted programs in schools across our country but particularly here in north carolina the institute reviewed national data on gifted programs in highpoverty schools which are generally filled with black and brown students the gifted gap report found tha  t while most highpoverty schools offer programs for gifted students they tend to have few students enrolled researchers involved in the study determined that africanamerican and hispanic students are underrepresented in gifted programs in all states and in all types of schools but even more so in schools where most students come from impoverished backgrounds north carolina is among  states where fewer than  percent of black and hispanic students are in gifted programs compared with almost  percent of all north carolina students in north carolina schools with poverty levels of  percent or higher only  percent of black and hispanic students and  percent of all students were in gifted programs this finding was among the nations lowest levels the study reinforces the findings of counted out a  investigative series by the charlotte observer and the raleigh news amp observer that examined seven years of state data focusing on lowincome students with high scores on state math exams the data compiled showed that lowincome students were less likely than nonpoor students with similar scores to get access to gifted programs and advanced classes the fordham report recommends using new universal screening practices to identify gifted students it is disappointing to see that we are not investing in our students from lowincome families and in students of color to help them to achieve their highest potential our school systems need to make sure that they are investing in all of our students and that they are allowing them the opportunity to become part of gifted programs these programs can allow them to succeed not only in school but also during the course of their lives httpwwwcharlotteobservercomedarticlehtml,1

let us take a brief look at hb  a bill currently before the house of representatives and referred to the house committee on energy and commerce according to legiscan it is
covid testing reaching and contacting everyone trace act this bill authorizes the centers for disease control and prevention cdc to award grants for testing contact tracing monitoring and other activities to address covid ie coronavirus disease  entities such as federally qualified health centers nonprofit organizations and certain hospitals and schools are eligible to receive such grants in awarding the grants the cdc shall prioritize applicants that  operate in hot spots and medically underserved communities and  agree to hire individuals from the communities where grant activities occur
we learn this about hb  from congress official text of the bill on congress gov
to authorize the secretary of health and human services to award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for covid and related activities such as contact tracing through mobile health units and as necessary at individuals residences and for other purposes
a citizen might ask questions like is the cdc constitutional where in the constitution does it legally and explicitly authorize this government agency are they allowed to give grants for such activities like going to individual residences as they deem necessary what does the phrase for other purposes mean what are those purposes will i be able to refuse a visit from those who receive these grants if the bill passes what is the cost to me the taxpayer
yes there are lots of questions you might ask on the other hand you may yawn at all of this legislative jargon they are your rights and those of your posterity that are at stake people often write to me and say that we need to keep congress accountable this is one way to do it
the life we aspire to depends on the type of government we have it is essential now more than ever to be informed
this is common sense civics and citizenship

"the romanian senate dominated by psd and its satellites approved a simple motion against the minister of internal affairs ion marcel vela psd ignored the documents and figures presented by ion marcel vela during the debates the motion was a simple psd political game a simple motion cannot lead to the dismissal of a minister even if it has been adopted
ion marcel vela brought in the plenary of the senate documents proving that the psd government ignored the requests of the department for emergency situations to replenish the stocks of medicines and equipment
ion marcel vela explained that all the measures during the pandemic with the new coronavirus although restrictive were correct and were taken to protect the health of the population
ion marcel vela resources were consumed when we took over the government the department for emergency situations has repeatedly requested the ministry of health starting in april  to replenish stocks all the steps taken between  which aimed to build up reserves of medicines and equipment were not taken into account by the psd governments as it results from the dsu addresses i brought you these documents here there are  addresses which dsu sent to some psd dignitaries including the ministers of health and interior of the psd governments you have been in power you did not prepare the country for the pandemic
there is talk of large fines but the limits of the fines previously set by psd were  times higher
we started from the same level with countries such as spain italy france belgium or great britain which today record tragic figures compared to those in romania this shows that the measures although restrictive were correct and were taken to protect the health of the population
all decisions were made following technical and scientific analyzes to limit the spread of the new coronavirus by taking exceptional measures with direct and immediate effects to protect the health of the population
while romania has  cases of infected people per million inhabitants spain has  france has more than  belgium has more than  italy has more than  and the united kingdom has almost  these figures show that we have taken the best measures",1

some thoughts about trophy hunting trophy hunters are people who like to kill animals and enjoy doing so so much that the hunters are willing to pay hundreds thousands and in some cases even hundreds of thousands of dollars in order to be allowed to do so why  paulette weisberg almost  million wild animals are killed by hunters in the united states each year many if not most of those animals are not killed for meat or in order to prevent starvation control dise  ase protect communities from dangerous animals or for any of the other reasons sport hunters often use to try to justify their activities those animals are killed because the sport hunters like to kill animals why else would poaching be so rampant and canned hunting be so popular  christopher nicholson twothirds of people in the united states oppose trophy hunting then why does the federal government permit it on public lands and why does the government permit canned hunting when threequarters of people oppose it  including many hunters  laurence branning poaching is rampant here in the united states as well as in africa experts estimate that less than five percent of poachers in this country are caught and at least as many wild animals are killed illegally as are killed legally i call upon the government to start enforcing the hunting regulations much more vigorously so that the killing is at least done within the law  edward parchese information about related issues related news facts quotes what you can do and more httpwwwanimalmattersorg,1

business tax ballot measures  this elections two sides of the progressive coin heads  the very hopeful story of proposition c universal childcare in san francisco tails  the sad story of proposition d affordable housing for all despite a  million yes on d campaign on election day prop d went down in humiliating to defeat  not even winning a simple majority let alone its necessary  vote but proposition c has won a close  vote victory   to  disclosure todco strongly endorsed and provided  in support to the proposition c universal childcare in san francisco campaign the setup proposition d was put on the june ballot on january th by five members of the board of supervisors it proposed to impose a new gross receipts tax of  on revenues a business receives from leasing some commercial spaces in san francisco to fund homeless services housing for extremely lowtomiddleincome households and for other public purposes the city controller estimated it would generate approximately  million per year for such programs because it was placed on the ballot by the supervisors due to proposition  rules proposition d required approval by  of city voters to go into effect the backstory is that proposition d was quickly drafted and brought forward in the weeks following mayor ed lees sudden death with the cooperation of the staff of the new acting mayor there had been no discussion at all of such a housingfunding june ballot measure before this and prop d featured prominently as one plank in the campaign of one candidate for mayor in the june election who was endorsed by all its sponsors the second factor in this election scenario was the competing proposition c ballot universal childcare measure that would increase the same city business taxes at a higher rate   to fund quality early care and education for young children and for other public purposes the city controller estimated it would generate approximately  million per year for such programs this ballot measure had been developed and drafted in the second half of  by a broad citywide coalition of childcare service providers and advocacy groups it was put on the ballot by it proponents collecting  registered voter signatures which also means that it potentially required only a simple majority of voter approval to go into effect this legal issue has not yet been finally resolved by the state supreme court because they both proposed to increase the same tax whichever one of these measures secured the most votes  provided that prop d got its required  vote to start with  would be the one that went into effect  the other would be void prop c featured prominently as one plank in the campaign of another candidate for mayor in the june election who had worked closely with this community coalition from the start plainly both measures proposed a very progressive funding source increased city businesses taxes to achieve vital community and civic goals  more affordable housing or greatly expanded affordable childcare  that would directly benefit lowerandmiddleincome san francisco households but only one could win at best and both were part of the mayors race too  prop d very intentionally so the community conflict children vs housing was an instant wedge issue for the citys politically active progressive community constituencies prop c advocates were understandably unhappy even angered about the sudden appearance of a competing ballot measure at the last minute that was so clearly connected to the unexpected june mayors race this included a wide range of community organizations across the city of many types engaged or concerned with family and education services other activists felt that the longtime affordable housing issue a mainstay of san francisco progressive politics and a generally popular political cause was being opportunistically rippedoff for other transparent political purposes prop ds community advocates did not directly address these reactions publicly core support came from several  but not all  of the citys nonprofit affordable housing developers and their networks that stood to gain directly from prop d new funding this included the megascale multistate nonprofits like mercy housing and bridge housing local communitybased groups like chinatown cdc tenderloin ndc and mission housing development corp and their forprofit construction and management companies like nibbi bros and the john stewart co in private some prop d advocates offered a realpolitik assurance dont worry prop d cant get a  vote anyway so it wont ever block prop c and all prop c needs is  to pass as a compromise a number of groups endorsed both measures despite the selfevident logical inconsistency of this position the overall outcome of these community dynamics was a significant estrangement among the two measures supporters prop ds campaign received little community support outside the networks of its core beneficiaries and political sponsors prop c had a significantly broader community base thanks to its inclusive communitydriven development and initiation downtown opposition to props c and d there was no division among the citys business constituencies  business tax increases are bad vote no on both c and d lead by sf boma the building owners and managers association and with the financial support of the chamber of commerces san francisco forward pac various business associations and dozens of downtown property owners the committee for an affordable san francisco no on propositions c and d has so far spent at least  to defeat both measures this mainly funded mailers and many tv ads prop c alone was especially targeted due to its greater likelihood of passing with just a  vote the oppositions general theme acknowledged the worthiness of affordable housing and childcare but objected to taxing business interests alone for this as unfair andor economically counterproductive predictably the san francisco chronicle and business times both supported this view few if any community groups formally opposed either prop c or prop d political endorsements followed the political alliances of each measures sponsors on the board of supervisors the yes on prop c campaign prop cs supporters raised at least  for the yes on c campaign funding some mailers and extensive social media ads in addition to todco the principal funders included the seiu the campaign also coordinated to a degree with other progressive ballot measure campaigns like yes on f the campaigns general theme emphasized the three components of the measure  immediate lowincome child care center waiting list slots for  children future middleincome family subsidies and increased wages for child careeducation workers the yes on prop d campaign prop ds supporters raised over  for the yes on d campaign how it was used is not evident the campaigns general theme focused on the crucial need for affordable housing and homeless housing in san francisco the principle funders include two longtime political establishment pacs the committee on jobs and progress san francisco as well as many politicallyconnected developers interestingly kaiser permanent contributed  presumably as part of its new regional affordable housing program even facebook corp chipped in  several nonprofit housing developers added a total of  and the sf police officers association added  the voters judgment on june th election day downtowns sophisticated and wellfunded no and c and d campaign was certainly very effective proposition d was absolutely crushed failing to achieve even a simple  majority vote and with just  approval against a  no vote  short of its required  approval vote after a weeks counting of late ballots proposition c has won by about  votes lessons to learn this hard way  a divided community cant beat downtown because they were in direct competition with each other neither prop c nor prop d had universal community support if the community resources that were devoted to prop d had instead been combined in support of broadbased prop c then prop c would have won by a substantial margin despite the onslaught of downtown s against it but the topdown last minute prop d never stood a chance  it can take a mayors committed leadership to win revenue ballot measures especially  votes simply appealing to holy issues like affordablehomeless housing or child careeducation is not enough no bond or special tax measure needing  voter approval has ever passed without strong political support from the mayors office as interim mayor mark farrell had no real political capital to give prop d and mayoral support dramatically increases the chances for majorityapproval tax measures if the state supreme court rules this is a valid option for future voterinitiative tax measures this will be a crucial leadership opportunity for the citys new mayor  prop ds community supporters were played for fools given these two hard allthetime realities there was never any realistic hope at all of getting a  vote for prop d in the current circumstances especially while having a divisive mayors race at the same time too the cynical political strategy of at least some of prop ds initiators to use it as a wedge issue to divide progressive community resources and thereby defeat the very  from their point of view  politically dangerous likelytowin prop c may well have worked and prop ds community supporters have nothing positive to take from their humiliating  showing and wasted resources their willingness to fall for this sucker bait was astonishing in its naivet�� and the broken community trusts it leaves behind may prove hard to heal  downtown can be beat prop cs victory without mayoral and establishment support and against strong opposition shows the path to winning progressive ballot measures  even sizeable new downtown taxes it appealed not to just the left but to all san francisco constituencies concerned with the future of children and families in the city it proposed to financially assist not just lowerincome households but middleincome families too and it mobilized a diverse community network that does not usually engage in electoral contests the citys child care and educational providers and their many members this is an important victory john elberling president todco

the  capital budget was recently presented to the current mandeville city council the repercussions of approving this budget at this time could have long lasting effects on the city citizens need to be aware of the situation

heres how we make sure bardstown rd survives covid bardstown rd is the heart of the highlands and will only reach its maximum potential by burying the power lines allowing us to invest in a world class tree canopy this will be especially critical as we deal with the longterm implications of covid rebuilding our local economy and addressing climate change without a vibrant bardstown rd the highlands will suffer we were already seeing hints of a decline and now  with the challenges facing small businesses moving forward it is critical that we create an environment that gives them the best chance at success this long overdue investment will pay for itself many times over by dramatically improving the quality of the street while increasing property values and thus taxes it will create an even more vibrant street that attracts hundreds of thousands more visitors a year who will increase sales at existing businesses and also incentivize new businesses to move to the corridor the traffic and lighting study is a much needed move in the right direction but with the changed economic environment these updates are not enough to alter the longterm trajectory of the street or to ensure our neighborhood continues to thrive for the foreseeable future while bardstown road was once the only cool kid on the block we now face competition from many other areas of town in attracting visitors and businesses despite bardstown rd being one of the most valuable corridors in the state generating many millions of dollars in tax revenue yearly and clearly in need of investment many will ask how can we afford this project phase  would run from taylorsville rd to broadway approximately  miles encompassing  properties assessed at nearly  million hundreds of small businesses occupy those properties including at least  restaurants that avg over a million dollars in sales each those restaurants alone yearly generate over  million in sales taxes hundreds of thousands in occupational taxes and millions in other feestaxes a ten percent increase in property values of just the adjacent properties an amount that understates the potential increase in value that will be provided by this investment in the streetscape alone would generate several hundred thousands more a year in just property taxes additionally with these improvements i estimate at least  additional visits to the street yearly generating  million in additional business sales and hundreds of thousands in additional tax revenue including sales taxes occupational taxes and parking meter revenue all added to louisivilles coffers how does one even begin to quantify the value of having a world class street to the tens of thousands of people who live adjacent to it and to the hundreds of thousands of people who use it work along it daily and who will have a much better experience be it the reduced temperatures and shade in summer or the esthetic improvement in winter there is no doubt this is a dramatic improvement in the quality of the built environment while that value will not be measured in cash there is no doubt that our community will value it tremendously louisville gas and electric company has publicly estimated the cost of burying the power lines at roughly  per mile lets conservatively double that cost and add another  million to plant and maintain around one thousand  inch trees the  million invested in this project will be almost doubled in just the increased property values and this investment will generate millions of dollars a year in additional taxes dramatically improve the experience of all those who use the street attract many more visitors and ensure the success of the bardstown rd and the highlands for generations the most valuable investments we can make as a community are ones that improve the quality of life for existing citizens and support existing businesses keep in mind we spend exponentially more than the cost of this project on convention centers luxury hotels sports stadiums and widening our interstates all without even batting an eye we have all enjoyed the cleaner air and lack of traffic during the shutdown and now that we understand more clearly the value of curbing vehicle and industrial pollution we can never go back we must recognize the world and city have changed and prioritizing investments that improve public health and create more livable and enjoyable spaces must be our communitys priority moving forward please share so more people can see for themselves the beautiful street we are missing out on thanks dan democratdancom paid for by daniel borsch for metro council,1

people couldnt stop talking about the show the media was all a buzz about the swiveling hips that couldnt be shown on television it was september of  and the show was the ed sullivan show and the hips belonged to a young elvis presley the censors decided that it would be inappropriate to film elvis presleys hips gyrating in a sexual fashion in front of americas families so they decided to film only his upper torso fast forward to the half time show of sup  er bowl liv on february   i did not watch the super bowl but i could not escape the incessant chatter about the sexually charged half time show put on by jennifer lopez and shakira that also involved pole dancing as i understand from reading the news stories and all the posts on social media even before the game ended americans have been faced with ever increasing scenes of sexuality and nudity on television for many years you see this is what happens when men and women reject god and move farther away from the moral absolutes taught in the bible why should we be shocked by such a display of flesh and sexual movements is it because there were children watching christians are so drunk on the worlds entertainments they cannot imagine giving them up they are addicted they believe they should not have to give them up so when the display of sin becomes too much they shout and stomp their feet they demand that those men and women living in darkness  those who have their hands on the controls of hollywood and sports and on the entertainment industry in general  should suddenly feel shame and submit to a higher standard of human decency and clean up the airwaves so that godfearing folk can continue feeding their addiction with a lesser feeling of guilt we are fooling ourselves hollywood and the entertainment industry have never submitted to a higher standard to keep the airwaves pure they have only taken their move toward violence and sexual immorality at a slow enough pace to allow gods holy but addicted church to adjust and to conform to the darkness around them we may do a little kicking and screaming along the way but we have settled in quite nicely through the years and have enjoyed the ride this latest prudish albeit hypocritical outburst will soon be forgotten and our families will be that much more desensitized and that much less godfearing there is no fear of god before their eyes romans  and everyone did that which was right in their own eyes judges  jesus said but i tell you that anyone who looks upon a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart matthew  men if you claim to know christ the enemy is after your purity i am afraid that many of you have been defeated you have given in to lust so many times and for so long you now hide it and feel there is no need to fight it any longer you now act as if lust is normal and you are simply being a real christian by accepting it that is a lie of the devil god is a gracious and loving god but he absolutely hates your rebellion and sin he commands that you work diligently to rid it from your mind heart and body by his grace he is calling you back to righteousness and purity of life the grace of god teaches us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live soberly righteously and godly in this present world titus  repent christian turn away from looking upon women to lust purify your hearts and minds each day spend more time studying the word of god and praying make it a habit to listen to sermons and to christian podcasts each day as opposed to filling your eyes and your mind with the world present your bodies a living sacrifice holy and acceptable to god which is your act of worship and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind romans  it is your choice christian do not let your flesh and the devil move you away from your holy calling now establish yourself in the faith be strong in the lord and be holy let us do the will of god as we continue to walk this kingdom journey together,1

"lebanon two explosions of rare violence devastated part of the city of beirut on tuesday august 
more than a hundred dead thousands of injured and hundreds of thousands of homeless are to be deplored
the country is in shock
a cargo of  tonnes of ammonium nitrate is believed to be the cause of the two explosions
but what is ammonium nitrate
ammonium nitrate takes the form of an odorless white salt it is mainly used as a component of nitrogenous agricultural fertilizers called ammonitrates
in itself it is not a fuel but an oxidizer that is to say it allows the combustion of another substance on fire
and what is the relationship with ecology
according to the inrs ammonium nitrate is a danger to human health and the environment
following a sufficient supply of energy for example a fire ammonium nitrate decomposes and releases nitrogen oxides nd video
these gases are likely to cause air pollution and subsequently acid rain
inhalation of the released gases nitrogen oxides causes pain in the chest shortness of breath cough acute irritation of the respiratory tract see more
ammonium nitrate also presents a risk of pollution in the event of excessive presence including in groundwater
its nutritional properties promote massive growth of algae in the waters
according to the inrs the latter can thus locally modify an ecological balance
of course the authorities asked everyone to wear a mask
several countries around the world responded to this disaster by sending relief
the government is doing its best to estimate the damage and react very quickly

responsibility and trust in america community is the seat of civilization it is in our local communities that we engage with one another facetoface and work shouldertoshoulder it is in responding to crises and meeting shared needs that we earn respect learn patience and build trust with our neighbors we can overcome disorder in our own little corner of the world trust and responsibility dont just appear by good fortune they are formed in the trials of necessity  and hardship like a marriage a genuine commitment to community forces us to mature as adult people  emotionally intellectually spiritually perhaps this is why so many avoid full participation however there are other reasons to live responsibly just beyond the boundaries of family community is that place where the reality of immediate needs must be addressed and resolved americans have avoided personal responsibility for these aspects of civilized life for a long time we will continue to do so at our peril it was not always thus prior to the american revolution and for close to  years afterward americans gravitated easily even impulsively toward decentralized local governance and an independent frame of mind we managed our own affairs in cooperation with our neighbors and expected regional autonomy as a natural condition civil society flourished during americas first century a vibrant force that was documented admiringly by alexis de tocqueville in his two volume commentary democracy in america americans created an immense variety of civic organizations to address every conceivable interest and social need citizens did this on their own initiative inspired by their sense of belonging and the spirit of the times there were few restrictions or constraints the need for community in america both in spirit and as a practical matter is as important today as it has ever been it is only in direct engagement with our neighbors and in all spheres of problemsolving that we will learn the skills of living and working productively with one another as americans we have been here before and we can do it again some argue that the decentralist tradition of the american past represents an ideal to which we should aspire and this is indeed an attractive vision but i think it should be apparent for all to see that there must be a balance struck between a nation of fully engaged local communities and a competent and trustworthy central government that respects and protects the primacy of local responsibility at the present time it is difficult to imagine a limited central government managed by mature adults who are prepared to protect both our freedoms and our security but that is what we need without law there can be no freedom and there can be no freedom without a mature understanding of responsibility i believe that a valid vision of limited government for the american future can only come from a view firmly anchored in local communities those who understand trust moral responsibility and constructive action  and who recognize the very high stakes involved  will build the foundations for the american renewal at home with their neighbors building unity within communities is a gradual process it depends on each of us to reach out across our differences to form friendships that develop trust to be supportive at times of trouble and to influence the hearts and minds of all who care it will take time and patience creative thinking and new skills and we will do it because america is too important to lose the future of humankind depends on it tom dear readers this blog posts regularly watch for the next post on or about november  a project description and several sample chapters from the forthcoming book are posted at the main blog site wwwfreedomstruthnet,1

"politically the markey kennedy primary is a most interesting contest i have run several informal polls mostly on progressive sites which all show a strong preference for markey now the daily kos endorses him it is clear that the more progressive wing of the democratic party favor and will be voting for markey over kennedy in the democratic primary
nowadays in the republican party the winners in the primaries are the more right wing candidates the interesting question here is will the more progressive candidate win in this massachusetts senate primary race no matter who wins what the result says about the democratic party in massachusetts is a very interesting question
of course the name kennedy may be making a disportioncate difference here that in itself is fascinating as decades have passed since the  is and the days of president kennedy and robert kennedy will new generations with all that has happened and that which exists in modern society respond enthusiastically enough to vote for a kennedy on the basis of name largely alone and against a long proven established senator preferred by young progressives like aoc and the sunrise movement
something in my gut has all along made me queasy about voting against markey in this context i love the kennedy is and what they have done for our party and country and i wish joe kennedy iii would take up their mantle and fight loudly and with moral conviction against injustices like racism inequality gun violence and the desecration of our environment like robert kennedy did then run for senator or governor and i would be first in line for him

imagine a life without ptsdmost people who have it cant why because the mental health industry has been spreading some bad advice here is the sobering truth hi my name is kayleen and im an international ptsd recovery coach whos fully recovered from  yrs of ptsd when i look at the mental health industry today i see three problems that are causing an epidemic of hopelessness for people with ptsd  coping is the way to healing the world today has tricked everyone into thinking that coping  healingit doesnt coping only gives a false sense of security it feels as though youre fixing things but in the long term symptoms only intensify and eat you from the inside out why because coping doesnt heal the root cause of the problem it just manages the symptoms of it are coping skills bad not at all but to heal ptsd the root cause must be healed people who are just coping are merely getting byday after day to fully recover from ptsd you must have a proven method to reliably process the root cause of symptoms and not just cope with them  no healing plan if you fail to plan youre planning to fail most people do have a planbut its the hope amp pray plan they hope that their ptsd will just magically go away on its own but it never does i spent  years testing out the hope amp pray plan and my nightmares flashbacks and anxiety only intensified with time most people put their recovery their life and their loved ones lives in the hands of time they gamble their own future and their families future if you want to fully recover from ptsd you must have a proven step by step plan to heal and recover  dont believe its possible to fully recover society has planted a devastating mind virus that ptsd breaks a person forever that it permanently changes your brain and that you just have to cope and manage it for the rest of eternity everyone is shouting from the rooftops that people with ptsd are broken forever im here to tell you that they are wrong people with ptsd are not broken but unfortunately most people who have ptsd let the world push them around and dictate what they can and cannot do they again gamble away their own future and their loved ones future by allowing outside forces to control their destiny to put an end to ptsd for good you need to have a way to build an unbreakable belief that you can heal a belief that can withstand the forces of all the negativity setbacks and bad advice youll encounter along the healing journey are you making any of these three mistakes the truth is that making just one of these mistakes could prevent you from healing altogetheryoull become consumed by your past and your future will wither away and crumble to dust however if you want to change your ways break the chains of your past and build an extraordinary future i have good news i just put together a free training showing you exactly how i went from having  years of daily night terrors overwhelming anxiety and no hopeto being fully calm and relaxed with no relapses or symptoms whatsoever here is what you will discover  how to heal even if you dont believe full recovery is possible  the method that shatters healing plateaus and ends relapses for good  the proven process to eliminate symptoms for good this free training has helped people all around the world get what they need to make full recoveries from home ive helped people in the usa uk australia canada new zealand brazil poland sweden and many more you can register here for free,1

"do you know the most common thread between millionaires
they invest
not in the stock market
not in ecommerce
not in franchises
but in real estate
real estate is the most timetested income strategy in the world but the thing is that before a few years ago
only the wealthy had access to the best real estate deals
these days technology has completely leveled the playing field for anyone to get started with  down
with the same time and effort it takes to buy and flip junk at a garage sale
you could be flipping houses and making way more
most people think you need to use your own money to flip homes
you dont
ive flipped  properties without using my own cash
the best thing about getting started in real estate today
 you dont have to risk any of your own money
 you dont need a real estate license
 there is no need to rehab or repair the home
if youve ever bought and sold something before
you could do this i created a video where i show you stepbystep how this is done
check it out here
see you there
cody sperber
aka the clever investor
ps im getting a lot of direct messages saying something similar to the following
if youre so successful in real estatewhy do you teach others shouldnt you focus on flipping more houses
it is a valid question these days it is so easy to say youre a real estate expert on the internet
a few reasons
 my first love was teaching i wanted to be a high school history teacher
 i truly believe the world is a better place with more real estate investorswith more people working for themselves and following their dreams ive been fortunate to help many people successfully follow in my footsteps
 im inspired by you nothing gives me more energy to push harder in my real estate business than seeing one of my students absolutely crushing it

"it is patriotism in  to swing the dankort
what do you mean
here at christiansborg i have just heard the minister of finance talk about the danish economy

first and foremost it makes me happy that denmark is one of the countries that has done best in terms of health through the corona crisis and financially we are best equipped to get the economy going
the aid packages quickly came into place and have largely kept people in their jobs
there will be a bill to pay  billion has been spent but we are well helped by a strong economy a solid cash balance and then we can borrow at almost no interest
now it is a matter of implementing wise measures that can restore the economy and strengthen the green transition and our welfare
the seriousness and optimism can be illustrated by the fact that we are not yet on the other side corona virus and the disease covid are here yet but it brightens and if you can afford it it will be good for society community and homeland to contribute to turnover in clothing stores and restaurants",1

when is the screening of the territory
covid has not disappeared and for this reason it should not be underestimated at all
the restart should be guaranteed in conditions of maximum safety focusing above all on prevention through the  t strategy that is
testing as many people as possible with tests or swabs
trace the contacts of the positives with apps or surveys to test and isolate them
treat the sick as soon as possible with coordinated home or hospital care
in telese terme on the other hand strategy f is applied that is that of luck which as we know is blindfolded and does not see
everything is left to the sole sense of responsibility of the individual which however is not always possible to find

a little over a month ago i was one of only a couple legislators invited to a meeting led by the burleigh county auditors office and with many other local elected officials and poll workers to discuss the  election cycle and some potential changes they were considering to make for election day next november as tends to be the underlying factor in many conversations in our state this day there is a concern about whether our county has enough funding available to replac  e outdated election equipment and to purchase enough of that equipment to cover the  polling locations that were open on election day in  one of the proposals discussed at that meeting would cut the number of polling locations in burleigh county in  from  to just  district  alone the legislative district im so proud to represent would be reduced from  locations to just  other cities like lincoln and very rural communities like wilton sterling and wing would be reduced to  at that meeting i was basically the lone voice who pushed back and expressed my very serious concerns about how this would impact voters we already have a hard time encouraging people to vote and i cant imagine limiting locations and therefore access would improve that i immediately went to a few of my fellow legislative colleagues obviously all republicans here in the bismarck area and updated them on what i heard most of them had the same response i did together we requested a meeting with our county commissioners who ultimately make this decision we shared our concerns and committed to working with them on a solution that doesnt create more of a burden on voters come election day,1

"assembly member linda rosenthal and state senator luis sepulveda have introduced a bill in new york state that would close all live animal markets specifically prohibiting the operation of establishments where animals andor fowls are slaughtered or butchered for food it will also establish a task force to decide whether they should be banned indefinitely
while this is an outlandish piece of legislation this latest move from rosenthal comes as no surprise she has spent her career working against animal agriculture as well as other animal industries such as limiting hunting banning pet breeding and sales banning horse drawn carriages rodeos and more over the years we have written a number of articles about rosenthal is animal extremism and the legislation she has proposed these articles can be found on our website with a simple search if you are interested in learning more
bills introduced in both the senate and assembly
there are two identical versions of this bill being presented in both the new york senate and assembly the assembly bill a has been introduced by linda rosenthal d and the senate version s by state senator luis sepulveda d both bills are currently in committee awaiting to be heard on the floor these two legislators are working in conjunction to close the  live markets that reside in the state of new york
false claims versus the facts
in a statement rosenthal has falsely claimed that these facilities do not adhere to any sanitary guidelines nor do they see any regulation or oversight the truth is that the new york state department of agriculture and markets nystam is directly responsible for overseeing and regulating live animal markets in the state according to their  annual report the department of animal industry dia tested over  birds that year at several hundred different markets and dealers and none were positive for the avian flu the same can be said for  as well the department of animal industry is made up of a staff of field and office veterinarians animal health inspectors and more all dedicated to ensuring that the animals going through those markets are healthy and safe for human consumption
the nysdam annual report also explains that
domestic animal health permits dahp are issued to livestock and poultry dealers department laws and regulations require dealers to properly identify animals and record the details of all transactions to allow for tracing to the point of origin and disposition dai veterinarians and animal health inspectors conducted  dahp inspections on  dahp holders during  field staff also inspect livestock markets to determine compliance with department laws and regulations in general market inspections are performed quarterly and consist of a facility inspection evaluation of cleaning and disinfection procedures and an inspection of animal identification and recordkeeping practices dai field veterinarians and animal health inspectors performed  livestock market inspections on  markets
this proves that not only is there oversight and regulation pertaining to live animal markets in new york but also that those regulations are being implemented successfully as a lawmaker in the state of new york rosenthal should know this if she is aware of the department of animal industry is veterinarians and animal health inspectors then what does that say about the claims she is making
legislators ties to the animal extremist movement
linda rosenthal has spent her entire career sponsoring outrageous legislation that pushes forward the ideology and agenda of animal extremist organizations some of the language in her legislation has been so restrictive that it would make it impossible to even have a pet dog just this year she proposed a bill that would limit options for pet owners by banning pet stores from selling dogs cats and rabbits she has solidly aligned herself with organizations and legislation that seeks to limit animal ownership in the state and animal industries that reside there the animal extremist group the humane society of the united states awarded rosenthal with the humane legislator of the year award based on her efforts to push legislation that aligns with their movement
luis sepulveda is closely associated with nyclass an animal rights organization we have highlighted before especially due to their continued efforts to ban carriage horses in new york city nyclass has endorsed both sepulveda and rosenthal among others based on their cooperation with carriage horse bans
misinformation must be addressed
amidst the coronavirus pandemic there have been several claims from animal extremist groups that are blatantly false regarding its connection to animals while the pandemic has been traced back to originating in bats it is false to claim that animal agriculture is to blame we as an organization refuse to sit idly by as animal agriculture is maligned by those who benefit from its demise this pandemic has affected most of us in some way however this situation has proven the importance of standing strong with our food producers and supporting them as much as possible we will continue to share truthful information about food production and will never stop bringing animal extremism to light",1

my town had some pretty strict bylaws about cutting down trees within town limits it is because we are part of a green belt meaning we have to maintain a certain amount of green space on our properties so for example you cannot just pave over your entire front lawn for extra parking spaces and any existing trees on the property must be left alone unless removal is absolutely necessary for construction purposes or safety concerns normally this is not an issue because we are  a fairly rural town the lots are pretty big plus having all the tree cover gives you a lot more privacy where this became a problem was in  when a massive ice storm hit it knocked out power for  or  days it also severely damaged a large tree on the front lawn of a acre lot just on the edge of town the man who owned the lot was a retired farmer about  years old who was a wellknown figure in the community he had built the house pretty far back off the road on his property and right next to a massive tree the same one that was now damaged by the ice storm spring came the tree died and looked like it was now in danger of falling on the house he had a local tree service come out to inspect it and they confirmed that if something was not done the dead tree could fall down possibly towards the house since there was a large split forming in the trunk as a result of the ice storm damage the tree service could not do anything without the man getting permission from the town first since the tree would need to come down trimming would have been fine but not cutting it down to make it more infuriating a neighbor literally next door was outside the town limits and therefore was free to clean up the storm damage however he saw fit the man went and applied for a permit to have the tree service come out and cut down the tree he also provided them with the quote from the tree service stating that it was a hazard the permit was denied by the town with no real reason given with a nasty thunderstorm in the forecast which he feared might send the tree crashing down on his house and the town not giving him permission to do anything about it he decided to take matters into his own hands and got a hold of a copy of the town is bylaws regarding this situation to see if there was a loophole somewhere oh boy was there ever a loophole the town had made a pretty serious mistake in writing their bylaws have you ever noticed how laws are always written in a really strange overcomplicated way well this is done on purpose to try and minimize any creative misinterpretations of the law our town however had written some of its bylaws in more or less plain english saying that it was illegal to cut down trees without approval from the town note the word cut in that sentence this is important after a quick phone call to his attorney this man somehow got a hold of a caterpillar dr which is a massive bulldozer for those of you who do not know probably borrowed it from the local gravel pit or something since he had that kind of pull in town anyways the next day when the bylaw officer knowing full well that the mans permit had been denied caught him cutting up the already fallen tree he stopped to investigate the man calmly explained that he had been using the bulldozer which was still sitting on the front lawn to tear up a section of dead grass so he could reseed it when he had accidentally bumped into the tree with the blade causing it to fall over and away from the house in the opposite direction from where it had been leaning obviously the town saw right through the cover story and knew full well that he had knocked the tree over with the bulldozer on purpose and slapped him with a fine for it he took it to court and won as the town is bylaw stated that cutting down trees without a permit was illegal but it said nothing about pushing them over with heavy earthmoving equipment the bylaw was changed and has since been repealed entirely and you are pretty much allowed to do whatever you want with your property as long as it maintains the green space requirements,1

"interior minister marcel vela handled the situation very well in this crisis caused by the covid  pandemic and as a reward psd and its parliamentary satellites initiated and voted a simple motion against him full of lies and misinformation
while  of romanians understood and respected the restrictions imposed by the difficult situation we are still in psd seems to have understood neither the need for restrictions nor the special measures taken to limit the effects of the epidemic all the actions of minister marcel vela aimed at the health of romanians their protection and the correct management of the waves of citizens who returned home from abroad there were many difficult moments maybe there were small mistakes but in the end we managed to get over this crisis quite well and the credit goes to the romanians who respected the measures imposed by the authorities but also to the government which mobilized very well during this period
for psd however the health and safety of romanians are not important for them only small lowstakes political games matter throughout the health crisis they have been pushing the government is work and now they are inventing reasons for unnecessary motions romanians know very well what the government did during this difficult period so psd will be left with only the embarrassing political actions in which it excels these days",1

to those still supporting the president someone posted this on our page and i believe it is worth sharing with you how incredibly biased your company is i hope your conservative customers take a hard look at what you are really selling you certainly do not want america to be great again i am a proud republican conservative and think our great president is making america great again first off let me say thanks for writing to you and every other writer of the    comments ive read along these lines in the last two years and yes we are biased biased in favor of the kindness at the heart of cooking through cooking we learn that when we take time to share kindness and care for those around us the world becomes a better place there was a time when this kindness was at home in both political parties for now at least those days are past reading all these emails has been an education at this point my response is if you werent hurting anyone you could believe whatever you wish and for the most part no one would say anything but you are hurting people by what your support is keeping in power your support of racism environmental devastation and the devaluation of our standing in the world is causing real harm not only to all of us right now but to future generations as well i understand how the realities our country is facing has been kept from you and that your thoughts are no longer entirely your own doesnt it seem odd to you how your mind can sincerely believe celebrities and business people should stay out of politics while at the very same time being equally sincerely excited about your celebrity businessman president and i have no doubt that you love this country but doesnt it somewhere deep down bother you that we are turning our allies against us while empowering and enriching those who would do us harm somewhere along the way you gave up something inside you of who you are something so fundamental to the functioning of democracy where once you would have held deep distrust for any candidate keeping their tax returns hidden you came to see the hiding of the truth as admirable where once you saw loyalty as key to character now it sure seems you are totally fine with third spouses playboy models and adult industry workers for all ive known and enjoyed conservatives all my life and i have to be honest with you and say this just does not sound like you please wake up your country needs you the good news is that a whole lot of people who were supporting all of this just a short while ago are now waking up and rejecting the personality cult the republican party has become and are instead finding their own path weve also seen posted recently i didnt choose to leave the republican party the republican party chose to leave me i and the rest of my family were born and bred republicans donated  canvased for votes both doortodoor and by phone worked the polls and this current republican party in no way resembles the party we supported i really cant view it as republican i am a lifelong republican and have never been more embarrassed to say so i am working diligently in my state of nh to get democrats elected dont let the label you have slapped on yourself not reflect the truth of what you believe i grew up in a republican family and heck even my mom isnt republican anymore the even better news is if you choose to make the change from everything weve seen a whole lot of people will be reallyreally happy that you did and they will welcome you with wide open arms as much as the president himself is pushing the false notion that those who oppose him are driven by hate and anger this simply isnt true hate doesnt drive people to work for transgender rights racial equality or the welcoming of asylum seekers just the opposite really for anyone who has come around to realizing supporting the president and those enabling him was a mistake but are now worried about how they will be treated if they come out and make the change please dont be really kind people are going to be very happy for you right now its not about where you have been so much as about where youve arrived and nows a good time to arrive at a good place i think you will find the food tasty here too not a lot of lonely desktop taco salads and buckets of deepfried fast food a big part of the fun in celebrating all the cultures that actually make america great is the cooks you meet and the foods they share dig in the election is now right around the corner as much as we believe every night is a good night to cook and theres nothing better

"still black smoke for the call for contributions to culture
press release of the progressive groups cagliari pd cagliari group sinistra per cagliari municipality project of the cagliari city council
due to the increasingly evident frictions within the centerright majority even this afternoon the city council will not be able to approve the document that would have allowed the offices to finally publish the announcement for contributions for cultural and entertainment activities
we are at the end of may and still the thousands of cultural and entertainment operators who work in the city have no indications from the municipality of cagliari previously the problem was the urgency of changes to the regulation wanted by the majority then came the coronavirus emergency which brought many activities to their knees including those of the creative business culture and entertainment sectors for which the answers are still insufficient both at national and regional level
mayor and council hastily proposed an extraordinary call with some exceptions to the municipal regulation for contributions approved by the majority in the culture commission on  april the vote was then canceled because the method of transmission of the document was not correct
on monday  may the commission examined a new text presented with the same protocol number and the same date but with some changes such as the inclusion of evaluation criteria and the reference to a subsequent call for proposals on this we have proposed some reflections useful above all to make the text clearer and more transparent even in the moment of emergency we are experiencing reflections also welcomed by the president of the commission enrica anedda
today yet another clash in the majority that has led to postpone the publication of a call for cultural activities in cagliari again therefore as of may  cagliari cultural operators cannot access contributions to culture either with the ordinary or with an extraordinary call
we hope that the proposed derogation from the regulation will be approved as soon as possible by the city council and that the call for the  contributions is finally published the operators in difficulty today as never before need clear and quick answers
although we do not fully agree with the proposed resolution at this point we believe it is more urgent that the notice be published rather than anchoring ourselves to formal issues on which we would certainly not postpone in different situations we hope that the majority will finally find an agreement and move on summer is almost upon us and the uncertainties of the health situation cannot allow the nonresponses of the municipality of cagliari to overlap due to political clashes of the centerright majority terribly harmful to the cultural fabric of our city",1

hate grows when a hateful thought is received and reiterated instead of rejected the received thought captures the heart and aligns itself with other corrupt thoughts to become an ideology and hateful ideologies like white nationalism must be challenged and deconstructed but while we are challenging and deconstructing we must also be truthful about national and global history the first europeans to arrive on this land brought with them a desire to be in power and to  conquer with a willingness to destroy indigenous people in the process the idea of america was founded with a spirit of superiority a quest for power and a sense of entitlement that spirit quest and sense also led america to trade africans and usher in hundreds of years of violent ritualistic slavery on this soil the blood still cries out silence during the holocaust hiroshima jim crow  this nation remains unrepentant charlottesville  white nationalism and racism werent challenged by the potus but some who came in the name of those evils left labeled as good people so white nationalism and racism fester and some assert that noncooperation with evil and speaking truth to power about injustice contributes to hate but silence  being complicit we must challenge hateful ideologies i believe as my parents did that the wise and woke way to do that and to eradicate what my father called the triple evils of racism war and poverty is by employing the strategy processes and philosophy of nonviolence theres nothing weak about nonviolence nonviolence examines history and the human condition it dissects issues and develops a strategy to arrive at humane solutions including policies nonviolence chooses love not the emotional bash that some define love as but love that corrects challenges and changes individuals and institutions as i mourn the human beings murdered in pittsburg this morning i also mourn that the potuss solution is not to shift our discourse and humanely investigate our issues but to insert armed guards in our houses of worship nonviolence knows better,1

as i sat down this morning in an attempt to make senses of the last  days here are my unfiltered thoughts  things i appreciated about aipac  that whoever believes aipac is a rightleaning lobby group certainly never attended the sessions of aipac   the presence of over  highschool students who engaged and debated burning issues  that i heard no disrespectful arguments nowhere during the conference and we are talking about  people  the hatikvah the story of the ethiopian jews the story of the doctor who was murdered by a terrorist and how his kids cherish life the essence of being a jew  the friends i met  the amazing nonprofits that were present at the village and beyond  that  people were organized in a way that you did not feel it that all the security personnel were freaking awesome and nobody had an attitude  that i actually learned a lot especially about south america visavis israel  that i finally got the chance to go out and ease a bit with people i like being with  that i met so many of you and your kind words hug and support made me smile for hours  things about aipac that give me unease  that the underlying message is that conservatives cannot be progressives  that rightleaning and conservatives are shamelessly equated with racism  that whoever says a good word about israel gets a standing ovation regardless of his past and actual actions see cory booker  that they make you believe that israel would not be able to exist without the us  that nonjewish panels are all about messianic and evangelicals as if nobody else could be a zionist  that this american lobbying type of culture is not something i can fully comprehend yet  that eventually it was a us presidential campaign  that the demonstrators outside are not there to engage regardless of videos you might see  they are aggressive violent and most of them do not even know where israel is  that big speakers get away with misinformation litvahina is not the only country where shuls are not surrounded by tanks or you cannot say czechoslovakia in   that everyone repeated  sentences that lost their essence after the th time israelus relationships have never ever been stronger that this friendship is unbreakable that for a safe israel we need this friendship the picture is not from this year as i had no time to take pictures this year lol,1

"covid the trieste case exists in all its severity
in the exposure of the virus emergency situation made to the rd council commission on may  the councilor for health presented data and graphs showing that the fvg was less affected than other regions and that there would be no alleged trieste case
on the other hand from a more careful reading of the official data it seems to emerge that a trieste case exists in all its gravity
in the province of trieste there is the highest number of infected people compared to the other provinces of the fvg as of  may there were  cases corresponding to  cases per  thousand inhabitants against a regional average of  per  thousand inhabitants this value is higher for example than those of all the provinces of veneto it is higher than those of all the provinces of veneto belluno  verona  padua  vicenza  venice  treviso  and rovigo 
as of may  the deaths in the province of trieste were  out of a total of  in fvg equal to  and if compared to the population they are triple  deaths in trieste per  thousand inhabitants compared to a regional average of  per  thousand inhabitants
in the presentation councilor riccardi highlights how the reversal point healed positive cases ie the moment in which the number of healed exceeds that of positives in fvg took place on april  but forgets to specify that in trieste it took place on  may
in trieste the epidemic is attenuating more slowly than in the rest of the region in fact on  may the positive cases in fvg are  of which  therefore  in the province of trieste where there seems to be an almost daily trickle of new cases
he worries that in trieste the percentage of recovered nursing home guests is  the lowest in the region given that it seems unlikely that the sick in trieste will heal more slowly this could be explained by the fact that in trieste the transmission of the virus is continuing to a greater extent than in the other provinces and the number of healed is lower because in trieste it is greater the number of recent infections which have not yet had a definitive outcome
of the infections among employees in the fvg healthcare companies asugi contributes   cases out of  total
no information has been disclosed so far regarding possible indeed probable patients in hospitals who have contracted the virus there
even with the limitations deriving from the incompleteness of the available data it seems unquestionable that almost  at least of the people who fell ill with covid in trieste are in the healthcare environment and in residential facilities for the elderly to these should be added family members and relatives of the operators who have contracted the virus who in the statistics are infected in the family environment although these cases originate from the care environments in which the virus has spread
it is now evident in fvg as in all of italy that the virus has mainly circulated in healthcare and residential facilities for the elderly important and widespread interventions are being carried out on the latter in trieste but the associations representing them have suggested that the infections within these would have started from people who have just been discharged from the hospital
it therefore seems essential that attention is now focused on hospitals also because the presence of covid wards in both trieste hospitals inevitably determines a risky situation
unfortunately it is not known what it is and what the trend of the outbreaks in hospitals has been because beyond a couple of situations that have emerged mainly from the press asugi has never presented complete reports and data and it is unthinkable that he does not possess them it cannot fail to carry out the investigations and reasoning necessary to explain understand and correct situations of this gravity considering them a priori inevitable based on population density and old age
it would be desirable for this information to be transmitted and made public in the absence of these concern for hospitals as likely reservoirs of the virus can only persist if sufficient attention is not paid to these verifying and correcting what is not working there is the risk of frustrating the efforts and sacrifices made so far not only by operators and administrators but by all citizens",1

i respectfully ask you to read below to explain why i deserve your vote on november   for a second term on cumberlands dr paul santoro for cumberland fire board  starting out as a volunteer firefighter at the station on the corner of mendon rd and route  when it was called the ashton fire department i learned from some excellent mentors that firefighting is a hazardous occupation the utilizes expensive vehicles and equipment as a fire board member for the last t  wo years i have worked hard maintaining a financially conservative approach while providing the cumberland fire department cfd with the equipment necessary to be the best fire department in the state about me i am a lifelong resident of cumberland and have a  yearold daughter who is a senior at uri i graduated from cumberland high school in  bryant university with a bs in business administration in  went to rhode island college for my pre med requirements  then i attended the chicago college of osteopathic medicine from  followed by my internshipresidency at newark beth israel medical center from  i am currently unable to practice full time medicine due to a congenital heart condition but am the medical director for rhode island dmatmrc as well as many other organizations i also teach at the physician assistant program at my alma mater bryant university as an adjunct professor what have i done in cumberland to earn your vote to be on the fire board for two more years as chairman of personnel subcommittee i met with the chief every  weeks for state of the stations updates we discussed issues ranging from the current number of firefighters out on injured on duty iod and their estimated return to work dates overall firefighter morale training updates vehicle and equipment status updates and anything else the chief wanted to discuss i took a proactive approach and we discussed injury prevention many times i suggested making the voluntary exercises and stretching routines mandatory to the chief and he researched it and found the proper nationally recognized guidelines to implement mandatory stretching we are working together to hopefully reduce injuries on duty which in turn will cost the taxpayers less money in the future this program is still a work in progress the chief would explain the condition of the vehicles and equipment as well as training within the department and town rescue service which leads to my role on the finance subcommittee its time to pay up now is the time for the town run rescue to pay the independent fire district for services rendered i strongly believe it is time for the town to start paying the cfd for the services we provide the rescue the town receives over  million dollars a year for the rescue services and the fire department gets zero dollars two thirds of our calls are to assist the rescue and we have had firefighters injured on these calls while the taxpayers of the fire district pay for the expense of these injuries the town makes the money furthermore i am sure many of you are aware that nowadays some rescue calls require two fire trucks which one could be our only ladder truck to be on scene for  minutes assisting the rescue that means that  six of the twelve on duty are assisting the rescue and the rest of the town is being covered by the other remaining six firefighters on duty after the  minutes on scene if the patient is transported two firefighters accompany the rescue to the hospital there is a  chance that our only ladder truck would not be able to respond to a structure fire during the  minute time period i understand this is controversial and discussing money and saving lives will spark controversy i am doctor and have worked in emergency departments since  i spent five years working in newarks busiest trauma center we were stretched for resources and made it work then and i dont see why we cant make it work now it is going to take communication collaboration and cooperation i am willing to work with everyone to make this work for the best interests of the residents of cumberland other achievements on the finance committee include meeting with the chief discussing the budget trying to find areas that could be slimmed down or eliminated also i made suggestions as to moving money we had in the bank into accounts that were gaining better interests which helped the chief truly went above and beyond working on the budget working many hours into the night with the finance director on the budget the district is currently handcuffed by the union contract that expires on june   it takes up  of the entire budget and only leaves  to run everything else to be clear i dont blame the union but rather bruce lemois who negotiated the previous contract and gave them offers they couldnt refuse this next comment has been corrected after clarification from one of the firefighters the men of the department pay their deductibles not copays and then are reimbursed by a third party vendor for up to  for a family and  for a single firefighters copays bottom line is the current contract is nonsustainable and it is up for renewal this term if bruce lemois is reelected the future is bleak and the department will likely end up in receivership which nobody wants to see happen once in receivership all the current contracts dont matter and the person assigned makes decisions regarding staffing and other administrative decisions hopefully the town will take over before anything more drastic happens because these men have spent many years as professional firefighters working in good faith and dont deserve to have the livelihoods put in jeopardy for bruce lemoiss political aspirations he recently admitted why he shouldnt be reelected when he admitted that he couldnt understand why a tax cut in  lead to deficits in  he intentionally left out the  deficit because he at least knew that was even too obvious to understand anyone who pays taxes and understands basic math can understand that lowering the tax in  led to less revenue in  which lead to a  deficit in  not that i nor anyone else wanted to raise the fire tax so dramatically but we were forced to do what our charter dictates our charter allows a  increase from the previous years tax levy which is a good thing for you the taxpayers this increase led to a carryover deficit of  in  because we were already set so far behind from the  cents per thousand bruce lemois saved you all in  which was a  tax rate increase to the town levy that  increase set the stage for years of deficit spending when responsible leaders took over and allowed the chief to budget for what the cumberland fire department needs as opposed to the reverse being told to make his budget meet this number the residents of cumberland are intelligent educated as well as informed and you already voted him out of office once so please dont make the mistake of voting for him back to cause more devastation cumberland deserves better than bruce lemois now on to some other things i have been working on for the future to help the residents of cumberland i have reached out to one our member of the general assembly to ask for a legislative grant ive been researching online for novel grants that can be awarded to independent fire districts as well as other sources of revenue i have had extensive discussions with the finance director about changing back to a once yearly payment verse our optional quarterly payment system she advised me that  of our payments come from banks andor mortgage companies who pay quarterly so they can gain interest on the money in escrow instead of the fire district we have an  milliondollar budget and having that money in the bank as soon as possible would allow the taxpayer money to gain interest which can be used to the advantage of the district as always taxpayers would still be able to call or meet with the finance director to arrange payment plans our finance director is fantastic and i have found her to be very accommodating to taxpayer requests i also discussed tiered taxing with the finance director regarding industrialcommercial and residential tax rates this is a possibility that could save residents money on the future fire taxes in the future do you know nursing homes which include short term rehab facilities are not required by law to have aeds in them neither did i until i went into one to visit a relative and was shocked it is simply incredible to think this is the law i did my research and am working with my colleagues at brown and harvard to gather our research together i am also working with a legislator who has agreed wot work with me on this issue and help get me pointed in the right direction so the law can be changed and lives can be saved in cumberland as well as the rest of the state of ri i am the physician in charge of hoperi which is a program that is federally funded and we have trained over  towncitycollegeuniversity police departments the state house and court sheriffs mall security etc in the use of narcan we recently secured  doses to distribute throughout the state of ri i lost count of the thousands of lives hoperi has saved i am also medical director in charge of a team that responds in to a natural disaster that may happen anywhere in ri resulting in large numbers of injured patients like the recent tornado in lincoln these are just a couple examples of my work behind the scenes to help people in cumberland and beyond i dont believe that members of the fire board should be paid so i donated my stipend back to the department for the last two years the way i see it the  dollars may not make a big dent in the overall budget but it will be better spent by the cumberland fire department than i,1

new hampshire homeowner story youre telling me i spent nothing out of pocket practically did nothing and now i have a brandnew solar roof jim had been outside over an hour cycling between a state of disbelief and pure accomplishment he repeated the same motions over and over look down at this electricity bill then back up at his brandnew tripleblack solar roof bill roof bill roof how could it have been this easy jims wife lisa finally dragged him back inside just before dark just last month he was watching the news something his wife lisa also must drag him away from dreaming of more ways he could make an impact he was always trying to find the next best thing to lower his carbon footprint on the planet but easy was never the word hed use to describe it easy not so much but totally worth it  hed bought a nice electric car that took forever and a day putting up with car salesmen  switched to cloth everything napkins diapers handkerchiefs kindagross but saving the planet gets messy and if you can believe this he not had zero paper mail coming in but that was no sweat for jim a little inconvenience was all part of being environmentally conscious and living as sustainably as possible but this this new solarpowered roof he marveled at his triple black panels glimmering in the sunshine knowing it would make the largest impact of all his endeavors and how quickly and easily it all happened he woke up one morning about a month before checked his email and hopped on facebook scrolling through the usual news soon enough he saw an advertisement on wwwnewhampshirehappeningsorg amp decided it was time to look at how feasible it would be to install solar panels on his roof hed been avoiding getting a solar estimate for one because he didnt trust his environmentally motivated impulse buying habits and for two because he thought itd be too expensive out of pocket but it turns out it was the easiest thing hed done so far he entered his address to see if his roof faced the right direction for solar and he immediately received a ton of info on what rebates and incentives were still available turns out new hampshire is on the forefront of everything solar jim was late to the solar party but not too late his roof qualified for  financing which was a refreshing considering what he was paying in utility transmission and delivery charges  of his installed system was paid for in tax credits alone plus his homes value went up and the year bumpertobumper warranty is fully transferable to the next homeowner a future millennial owner will be swept off their feet with this solarized home see if your roof qualifies here,1

should new hampshire communities allow religious symbols to be part of their annual winter displays on town property many communities open the holiday season with christmas related events  a santa parade singing carols and the ceremonial first lighting of a christmas tree in durham this year a menorah lighting to recognize the start of the jewish celebration of hanukkah was added to the holiday celebration but the lighted menorah was not permitted to be added to the  public holiday display that included a lighted christmas tree in part for fear that the menorah might be vandalized this has given rise to a debate as to whether the town should have any religious themed displays at all the town human rights commission and town council are considering the question proponents of removing the display from town property say a public display for the christian holiday may be offensive to people of other religions or who have no religious belief at all they favor a more neutral winter carnival themed display i am a person of no religious affiliation these things dont bother me but i understand how they might bother someone else said kitty marple the chairman of both the durham human rights commission and the town council advocates of keeping the display say removing the display altogether is an example of political correctness going too far some feel a christmas tree is symbolic more of the holiday season than an expression of any religious faith the whole idea behind the lights is to bring light into darkness its a positive thing said sally tobias a member of the durham town council others argue that the town square should be a place for communities to express their cultural diversity and therefore the christmas tree  and all other religious symbols  should be allowed,1

change a unit apartment complex called the san lorenzo village green has been proposed to be built on lot that has been vacant for nearly  years it is just one mile from a bart station this project will help alameda county meet its goals for addressing climate change an  d building new housing on july   the alameda county board of supervisors will decide whether the village green may move forward all five supervisors will vote on the project thus no matter where you live in alameda county the supervisor who represents you will decide the fate of the village green we request your support please contact your supervisor and ask him or her to vote yes on the san lorenzo village green because building new housing close to bart is an important step in fighting climate change every message is important here is the contact information for the supervisors keith carson keithcarsonacgovorg or   represents albany berkeley west oakland downtown oakland oakland hills north of piedmont

threatens our wellbeing today and poses a significant danger to the safety and security of the world our children and grandchildren will inherit in response the state of california s ambitious climate plan aims to reduce statewide carbon emissions to  percent below  levels by  much of the states climate plan relies on local actions related to housing production and related automobile use one important strategy is to build new housing close to bart stations instead of in suburban or rural areas far from the job centers this shortens work commutes reduces greenhousegas emissions from cars and creates vitally needed new housing within the existing urban bay area the proposed unit san lorenzo village green apartment project directly reflects state and local environmental goals and will help alameda county address climate change and the desperate need for housing the village green will be one mile from the bay fair bart station and on a busy ac transit bus corridor in addition the village green developer will provide all residents free clipper cards to encourage their use of public transit to connect with bart alameda county is woefully behind on meeting statedesignated housing production goals the village green represents the most housing units proposed in eden areaunincorporated county neighborhoods in decades a related benefit is the comparatively affordable rents and workforce housing discounts at village green the rents will be at market levels for san lorenzo which are much less than rents found in downtown oakland or san francisco for similar quality apartments we will also be offering discounts to teachers public safety officers and veterans nevertheless four trade unions have filed an objection with the alameda county board of supervisors asserting that the village green is environmental impacts were not adequately studied the unions objection is without merit the same unions have opposed recent housing projects in oakland and elsewhere in alameda county on equally frivolous grounds the village green is not in an environmentally sensitive area and will follow the highest standards for worker health and safety the apartments will be built on an asphalt lot shown in the photo above that has been vacant for decades and next to a major roadway hesperian boulevard in the center of san lorenzo alameda county retained an independent expert to examine our project the review was extensive the expert found that the village green complies with californias rigorous environmental laws in turn the alameda planning commission approved the village green project on july   the alameda county board of supervisors will decide whether the project moves forward all five supervisors will vote as the project is located in an unincorporated area of alameda county thus no matter where you live in alameda county the supervisor who represents you will decide if the san lorenzo village green project will be built we request your support please contact your supervisor and ask him or her to support the san lorenzo village green project because building new housing close to bart and an ac transit corridor is an important action we can take in

in the linked tallahassee democrat article you may notice once again i am the only candidate taking a different approach or action on a popular concept this time it is the idea of committing to a carbonneutral campaign and i want you to know why
i believe the folks who organized and offered this had the best of intentions and the candidates who agreed to it are trying to do the right thing to be honest i was very very close to also making this easy decision i would have agreed to what would have amounted to a small donation my name would have been listed alongside everyone else is and i could have forgotten about it i waited until the last possible moment to finally abstain because something just seemed to be missing and i finally realized it was action
too often government throws money at problems without demanding action this time is no different none of us candidates were asked to change our campaign styles we werent asked to send less mailers print less signs use digital messages more than direct mail we werent asked to drive around less we werent asked to save any carbon impact at all we were only asked to donate money afterthefact that money will be used in some manner after administrative costs to assist in some future project aimed at improving the environment for me this does not constitute a carbonneutral campaign for me this is government as usual and i am running for commissioner to stop participating in government as usual i am running to make real changes for the real people in our community
i commend those who are contributing to protecting our environment but i decided to take a more direct approach my campaign did not send out direct mailers instead we only did email blasts and digital ads we did have yard signs printed all through local vendors we are also giving away wildflower seeds and will be offering a few dozen sapling trees given away to offset any carbon footprint our campaign has had
direct action and the simplest solution to combat a problem without bureaucracy or administration eroding it away first
as your commissioner i vow to always find and fight for the most direct and simple solutions to issues impacting our county i will never agree to things just because they are popular or have catchy names i will always do my homework and demand direct action with benefits we can see locally and in real time as often as possible

"the pmp group of county councilors criticizes the defiant attitude of the president of the county council towards the problems of the people of iasi
today may  during the regular monthly meeting the pmp county councilors raised again the issue of the mobile hospital intended for the treatment of patients infected with the new coronavirus as with all the factories he ran maricel popa seems to be preparing a new stake in the case of the mobile hospital that is said to be set up in letcani although i voted confident that the citizens of the moldovan region will be able to be treated quickly this project has long delays many shortcomings serious irregularities and shows very clearly the lack of vision of the head of the institution not having the courage to come in front of the people of iasi to tell the truth about this project clearly and bluntly maricel popa sent a subordinate to say that june  is the new completion date of the project
we refuse to believe the lies of a man who managed the performance of losing about  million euros which come from the funds of the iasi county council and the neamt county council ie from the pockets of the citizens of the two counties the culprits for this budget hole but also for not realizing the promised mobile hospital have to pay
also in today is meeting we returned to the requests meant to come to the aid of the medical and specialized staff from the hospitals subordinated to the county council these are two draft decisions submitted by the groups of pmp and pnl county councilors on march  the first project provided for financial incentives for medical and support staff involved in actions to limit the spread of coronavirus and the second was for the purchase of medical equipment and products
although more than two months have passed since then the president of the county council maricel popa completely ignored our proposals it is the same attitude he has had since the beginning of his term to completely ignore any proposal that he does not like it never mattered whether the proposal came from a person who was not politically involved from a county councilor in the opposition or even from his own party colleagues",1

"of all places in the us to locate largescale solar power plants the sf bay area is one of the worst choices the region is rich in critically threatened species that require our protection
walling off open space and tearing up agricultural land on which threatened species live or use for migration or hunting to construct industrial solar power plants poses a direct threat to these species we can generate far more solar energy on rooftops and over parking lots in the bay area than by building utility scale solar power plants which should not be located in the immediate bay area
please share this photo with your friends in alameda county the north livermore valley is one of the few unspoiled rural areas remaining in the county let them know it is under threat from proposed massive industrial solar power plants
as background the us harbors a remarkable array of ecosystems that sustain an exceptional variety of plant and animal life but not all regions of the us are equal in terms of where conservation efforts are most needed regions harboring exceptional concentrations of vulnerable and critically threatened species are considered hot spots where it is imperative that conservation efforts be undertaken as explained in the landmark book precious heritage the status of biodiversity in the united states the bay area is one such hot spot region
biodiversity as explained by the world wildlife fund refers to all the different kinds of life you will find in one areathe variety of animals plants fungi and even microorganisms like bacteria that make up our natural world each of these species and organisms work together in ecosystems like an intricate web to maintain balance and support life biodiversity supports everything in nature that we need to survive food clean water medicine and shelter

"bogdan gheorghiu pnl deputy
mr ioan stan and the selected company in order to justify the fact that they violated all medical protocols on march   presenting themselves at the suceava county hospital for the covid test are embarrassingly related to the situation of president flutur fortunately for their lords and we continue to wish them health they were perfectly healthy unlike gheorghe flutur who went through illness and convalescence the question is why didnt you go to the dsp and go unconscious instead of going to the hospital which could be a driver of communitybased transmission of this virus
in absolutely all civilized countries those who hold decisionmaking positions must and are tested with priority because the state of health of a responsible person influences his activity in the service of the community
in the end mr stan as a direct contact seems to meet the eligibility criteria for testing but the others as alleged secondary contacts by no means had anything to look for there i repeat fortunately they had negative results and a period of  days of isolation a period that they used to the full for political conspiracies and false attacks
but in an attempt to strike at gheorghe flutur who was politely aligned with all political opponents and ordered press campaigns to destroy his image they hit suceava bucovina people and doctors at suceava county hospital
gentlemen the medical staff at sju went through the hardest period there was no need for political pressure with the smell of election campaigns an elementary reasoning doubled by some common sense would have made you see that the small team from the infectious diseases department of the county hospital has managed about  cases of people infected with this type of coronavirus almost  times more than the number of patients managed by matei bals hospital in bucharest with much more human and material resources this political attack strikes these people it strikes those whom you have deprived of the medical services and so limited from suceava

tariffs do they help businesses with global competition or are they killing american business they are killing american business tariffs sound like they should be a tax on other countries products so american buyers are less likely to import foreign products american companies can compete because american products are less expensive compared to the products produced by other countries and our companies win that is not exactly how they work when the united states  imposes a tariff on a foreign product americans pay the tariff and so the foreign products are more expensive for us and the us government pockets the tariff we pay for them if we buy less of those products because they are more expensive then the theory is our domestic companies will begin producing and selling those products and americans win and other countries lose thats not what happens we are a global economy and we depend on selling our products internationally and other countries depend on buying our product and natural recourses we are now in a fullblown trade war we do not live in a vacuum so our tariffs paid for by americans are met with tariffs imposed by other countries on our goods so we sell less of them in  american farmers sold  tons of soybeans to china this year our farmers sold about  tons of soybeans to china a fraction of the previous sales china is a huge country and is run by a central government that has sought other sources of products so when the trade war is over our sales to them wont come back the trade war is hurting american companies and we will probably not recover when we stop this nonsense jeff edberg ccim sior here is a well written article from the sior report from fall  titled economic war on tariffs commercial real estate brokers shouldnt ignore the tariff situation if the industrial market hadnt been so strong these past couple years transaction business and corporate expansion would have already slowed for every tariff the united states imposes on imports from a foreign country a retaliatory tariff is placed on american products sold abroad if this sounds like economic war it essentially is and in every type of conflict there is always collateral damage lets look at one unexpected area where tariff wars are hurting real estate brokers the businessmans lunch when the united states imposed a tariff on steel and aluminum imports from the european union the retaliation was a  tariff on harley motorcycles us whiskies and other goods brown formanthe maker of jack daniels and other liquorsreported the tariff situation is costing the company  million according to the wall street journal if the threatened tariff on mexico had not been retracted in june  it would have been hard for restaurants to cheaply source avocados and other vegetables and fruits grown south of the border avocado toast could have disappeared from menus if this all appears silly its not there is a caution here for brokers of commercial real estate robert hand sior a broker with louisiana commercial realty in metairie la produced a report explaining that tariffs steal money out of consumers pockets by causing prices to increase stifle creativity reward inefficiencies and destroy the competitive drive that allows a free market economy to deliver cheaper smarter and innovative products why brokers should pay attention totrade wars tariffs increase the costs of what your tenants sell so higher prices cause consumer demand to decline a manufacturer faces declining sales so to cut costs it will first take the easy route seeking rent reductions or curtailing expansion again according to the wall street journal the tariffsparticularly on steelhave cost general motors and ford billions of dollars each its not just the manufacturer the retail sector will be affected as well what we are talking about says hand are companies such as amazon walmart and home depot that utilize huge warehouses to store inventory and when consumers demand a product inventory is taken out for shipment tariffcaused priceincreases will be passed on to consumers who are going to buy less at retailers such as walmartand that means stocking less inventory and possibly a reduction in warehouse space the good news is that it takes about a year for the effects from tariffs to enter the system and another year for individual companies to start rightsizing warehouses says hand on the other side of the coin the bad news is the industrial sector will be the first to get hit as the need for warehouse space will decrease hand isnt the only one researching the tariff situation to get ahead of the curve geoff poston sior vice president of the cushman amp wakefield  thalhimer virginia beach industrial group checked in with the port of virginia in hampton roads an important contributor to the local economy the ports response is that it is closely monitoring the current trade environment and the effects any additional tariffs might have on its business says poston its forecasting shows that an estimated  of cargo moving across the port would be impacted by the latest round of us tariffs as of may  china is the ports largest trading partner and collectively chinese exports and imports subject to tariffsrepresent  of its total teu twentyfoot equivalent unit volume short and longterm the port is taking the tariff situation into serious consideration poston continues it is diversifying its cargo mix which is something the port has been planning for some time but now hedging its bets in a challenging trade environment poston also queried a pl thirdparty logistics provider handling shipping and receiving for manufacturers and other clientsincluding one that imports pigments for dying from south korea for this particular client tariffs caused the importation of pigments from south korea to no longer be economically feasible and the client turned to a domestic company the concern for some companies is that domestic providers are working from inventory and a change in pricing would come when new inventory is needed the trade environment is on everyones radar says poston its affecting certain industriessuch as agricultureimmediately other industries have experienced no effect so far but there will be in the near future another broker talking about the tariff situation with associates is jim steinbauer sior vice presidentrealtor with steinbauer associates inc in lakeland fla i have a good client in the stainlesssteel business in lakeland and we were discussing the tariff situation back at the beginning of the year says steinbauer my client testified in front of congress last fall he said the tariff on raw materials and different costs of production has raised his costs which he has been able to pass on so far his customers have accepted the higher costs also accepting the higher costs and passing them on are developers steinbauer adds he recently sold a acre parcel to a manufacturer who was going to build  square feet it will be a steel building and despite the higher costs the project is going forward steinbauer assumed the costs of the steel was locked in as early as last year although the recent scare about mexican tariffs caused a bit of worry during that kerfuffle the us lifted the steel and aluminum tariffs imposed on canada which will in turn withdraw the retaliatory tariffs it levied on billions of dollars of american imports construction prices are going through the roof says poston while labor is a challenge most contractors cite tariffs as an issue he shares steel prices are up although everyone has been able to pass the higher costs through to the consumer a domestic manufacturer i spoke to buys most of its metals in the us but prices have increased so steeply it has negatively affected margins he has been forced to increase pricing twice in one year according to the washington post in  us companies went on a hiring spree adding the most new employees in more than two decades as a good economy caused demand to rise unfortunately so far this year manufacturers added so few jobs the sector has seen the weakest gains since before the current presidential administration hiring in the manufacturing sector could become a concern if it starts to affect physical expansion by us companies as every commercial real estate broker knows the rising cost of steel and other tariffs has meant construction costs have vaulted and continue to do so but the need for new industrial space has meant those costs have just been absorbed how long that will go on is the big question the boom in the industrial sector hasnt diminished yet says steinbauer developers are spending money to build new warehouses but what happens next depends on whether they can get the increase in rents to match the higher costs to build poston adds so far he is seen no adverse impact to new construction in the industrial sector but it is something we are closely watching as every commercial real estate broker knows the rising cost of steel and other tariffs has meant construction costs have vaulted and continue to do so but the need for new industrial space has meant those costs have just been absorbed how long that will go on is the big question by steve bersman sponsored by the sior foundation contributing sior authors robert hand sior geoff poston sior jim steinbauer

"from today we have reopened our large garden to the boys and girls of the mount of olives
for almost three months the boys and girls of riesi like their peers throughout italy were forced home
there has been little or no talk of them of boys and girls throughout the pandemic and up to now
little because the priorities as often happens were other and childhood as often happens is never a priority for both public and private institutions
bad because the times when boys and girls were remembered they were portrayed as vectors of covid therefore a vehicle of death for their grandparents and for others
for three months in each of these very long days we have had no peace
we did not give up in front of the narrative that claimed that schools parks spaces dedicated to children had become the most dangerous places in the world
the schools the parks that had not contributed to the outbreak of the infection were closed and for long days and weeks there was talk of something else
the meaning or rather the common sense of words has been lost for some time and security has become synonymous with fear
thanks to a reasoned articulated and serious order the mayor of riesi wanted to restore hope to the boys and girls of riesi
within the law the provisions envisaged for containing and combating the spread of the pandemic and also in the awareness that it is no longer possible to unload the anxiety and fears we have tried and feel on boys and girls
in compliance with these measures as well as the provisions of the law as well as common sense we were able to listen to the shouting of the boys and girls along the avenues the gardens the outdoor areas
in the next few days we will continue with the program of structured activities outdoor education as we say now and what else will be possible to restore broken sociality to the smallest citizens
in the meantime since last september we have already experienced the minute hours as well as for more than  years outdoor teaching sport and music theater and poetry as disciplines on which we have never backed down even as much as the ministerial programs and the huge and often illogical bureaucracy was imposed relentlessly
of course now we have to rebuild three months of social desolation and we need the help of everyone and everyone of anyone who can and will
the monte degli ulivi village makes sense as a village for boys and girls a place for those who know how to look beyond the present time do not let themselves be imprisoned by anxieties and fear because while trying them they are aware that there is also much more in the world",1

why because with each machine  liters of water are rejected and the treatment plants are unfortunately not able to filter everything as a result laundry detergent ends up in our oceans
you use pimpant because you have chosen an easily biodegradable detergent a natural simple and effective alternative to current detergents which lead to water and soil pollution

"although you signed a severance agreement can you still assert an overtime claim
in the wake of the covid pandemic many employers have laidoff employees and provided them with severance packages in these severance packages employers agree to pay employees an agreedupon sum in exchange for a release usually these severance agreements broadly release any and all claims the employee may have against the employer these provisions are intended to a ensure employees do not assert any claims employees may have against their employers and b shield employers from any liability for any potential claims the employee could assert
under the flsa unless a private settlement of a claim for minimum wages or overtime is approved by the united states department of labor or a court the settlement has no effect and cannot be later enforced against an employee therefore although an employee may have signed a severance or other settlement agreement containing a general release the release of the flsa claim may be ineffective and the employee may be able to pursue claims for unpaid wages against the employer
if you have signed a severance agreement with your former employer but feel you were not properly compensated you may still be able to assert your claim for unpaid wages contact the shavitz law group pa at  or infoshavitzlawcom we would be happy to assist you in a free consultation to discuss your employment concerns

limiting the car access from dichiu to piatra arsa the effects can be seen in the accompanying images the solution would be to set up a traintype transport line preferably electric which at regular intervals would run the dichiupiatra arsa route with the arrangement of a parking lot at the dichiu chalet most tourists there walk to babele crucea caraimanului varful omu car access to piatra arsa should be allowed only to those who have reservations at the accommodation units in the area practically only piatra arsa and to the landowners a permit can be issued by the town hall

running ads of a political nature in america right now lets you see the pain and frustration people are feeling the comments we read are filled with emotions from hope to all out rage given the style of politics we have had for over a decade now it is easy to understand why by themselves each of the two major parties represent less than a third of the population is it ever going to work for either party to try and impose their will on the whole country metaphorically we  re in a big relationship fight weve escalated to the point of if you dont agree with me then im out of here it seems like were in that point of the fight where were so dug in that were ready to break up or get divorced now ask ourselves these questions what will happen if we do not resolve this fight what if it did lead to divided nations would we have the same military might if we were smaller separate economies if our adversaries wanted to destroy us what would we do if we were attacked while were in the middle of fighting with ourselves what would we do if we were attacked after becoming bitterly separated nations we would certainly be more vulnerable and would lose the strength we have today in the world is that the outcome we really want for those who dont think dividing ourselves further is the right directionhow can we start to come back together without compromising on our beliefs there is certainly plenty of blame to go around and we know many people will focus on that in the comments but in our personal lives has anyone ever resolved a bitter fight by forcing the other person to give up their beliefs has anyone ever resolved a fight by reinforcing that its the other persons fault resolving a fight starts with small steps that usually dont focus on the things that caused the fight lets be honest were not going to start by coming together on the hot button issues our nerves are too raw right now and it is understandable because there really are some issues where we have strong differences of opinion its hard for us to see right now how wed work together without compromising on our own sense of right and wrong so let us not start there instead there are some issues where were not so different if we start working together on those issues we can start to cut the tension and division we feel and just like in the moments after we resolve a fight we could start to see the other person as a someone we care about again even if we cannot imagine that right now at that time we might be in a better emotional state to find solutions we can agree on for today is hot button issues that do not require us to compromise on our values if we the people are encouraging our elected officials to fight with each other then that is exactly what they are going to do but if we the people are united in our support of what we want no one would stay in office long without getting in line over  conservative moderate and liberal americans have already committed to working together on the issues where we agreeand we are growing we are going to voice our support together on those issues to our representatives in washington check out our site to learn more about how we are doing it,1

"attention update press release of  what does aua have that thousands of entrepreneurs do not have please like and share if you would like to know or understand this
what does aua have that thousands of companies dont have aua renovation vs desperate calls for help from local small business owners christian huber innsbruck entrepreneur and chamber of commerce official asks uncomfortable questions to those responsible in the state
dear members of the federal government dear members of the national council dear decisionmakers in the most diverse functions and committees
i would like to address you with my open letter and thus state my fears my regret and my lack of understanding for some decisions made in the context of the corona crisis consciously as an individual consciously without partypolitical coloring consciously without any ideological approach just as the solidarity was announced at the beginning of the corona crisis i expect the elected representatives in the various committees to also close ranks in the urgently needed and overdue problem solving without partisan tactics and election campaign noise
it is not amusing to observe how the most diverse political representatives duel in their pools of ideas with proposed solutions for the best headline especially since some of the suggestions are more for the coveted likes on the facebook page than sustainable solutions does the abolition of the mns obligation mean that you really have more money in your pocket to spend or how should vouchers be distributed as widely as possible across the economy do wellknown addresses benefit the most from this it would be primarily a task for politicians and mandataries to pay less attention to headlines and more to content
the abolition of compensation under the epidemic law was a unanimous decision thus there is joint responsibility for further development through overly bureaucratic difficult to understand and nontransparent covid measures laws
the fact that some members of parliament are currently remembering the usefulness of the provisions of the epidemic act although they were in the economic interest of overriding the decisive provisions shows a certain ability to learn but it seems to come too late
the regulations of the epidemic act are generally known and quite understandable and sensible however the replacement regulations covid  measures are nontransparent incomprehensible in need of clarification and raise a large number of questions
let is take the example of aua in  austrian airlines recorded sales of around  billion euros this corresponds to an average monthly turnover without taking seasonal fluctuations into account and it wasnt the peak season ideally of eur  million according to the provisions of the epidemic act this turnover would correspond to support for three months midmarch to midjune with a very simple and extremely businessfriendly calculation of around  million euros assumption would be  euros turnover and all costs remain  exist instead there is currently talk of supporting the aua with an even higher sum put simply the aua would like more public money than it would ideally have spent in this period and also benefits from shorttime work layoffs and the fact that many costs kerosene takeoff and landing fees catering and lounge costs and much more are not incurred since there are no planes in the air especially from the point of view that the epidemic law for austrian companies was not implemented because the state cannot afford it i would like to ask you for an understandable and comprehensible explanation of this special circumstance
since you are informed about the current development in our country i will refrain from giving many negative examples and reports from the field of epus and smes which are opposed to the state support considerations of the aua alone the enumeration of the regulations such as partial assumption of fixed costs only from a  drop in sales with incomprehensible graduations or the company with subsidies as part of the hardship fund with minimum amounts of a maximum of  euros per month or public guarantee assumptions by the state for loans that the entrepreneur himself has to secure more than  of his own assets should be sufficient to prove this imbalance
i would also like to quote barbara stockl ombudswoman of the kronenzeitung from may th  no one will be saved this way and above all something must be wrong when so many feel abandoned to put it simply the austrian entrepreneurs who form the backbone of the domestic economy with their sole proprietorships or small businesses are being left to their fate by the austrian state despite announcements in the media cost what it may
may i ask you for an understandable and comprehensible explanation for the fate of the thousands affected
you all have a responsibility for the country with your office you have decided to work actively to be creative and to work for austria and its people in the best sense of the word i dont expect any excuses from you no political back and forth no but the others i expect simple and clear answers from you i expect equal treatment for all entrepreneurs and your full commitment to solving this dramatic situation

"money money money
it is not the title of the song with which betty curtis revolutionized music in the s but it is what in italy now everyone is asking due to the economic crisis triggered by the coronavirus
as is well known fca atlantia arcelor mittal and others asked for money from the street vendor to the small shopkeeper and gradually up to the big industry
what is disconcerting however is that they are asking for figures from many zeros including companies and individuals who in previous years declared derisory revenues to the tax authorities
the government has already approved and allocated  billion euros of new debts which will fall on the heads of our children because sooner or later they will have to be paid and there are those who expect hundreds of billions to rain from europe even if they were sweets which if they come will be by way of loans with heavy conditionality and in any case there is the sinister feeling that they would not be enough even if they were  billion euros
i remind you that today is  billion is equivalent to  thousand billion of the old lire and therefore in the interest of the nation since we are talking about large figures i would like to suggest that the government be very careful to distribute this enormous wealth without responding to logic patronage or worse still political and party squandering this great opportunity for economic recovery
but rather to exploit it to strengthen our agricultural commercial industrial activities requiring above all certain guarantees on the use of these resources finalizing them to the restructuring improvement innovation and modernization of companies with the possibility of control by inspectors state and with the commitment not to fire and not to close the business except for proven reasons

a comment of hope from our last post i was a republican from the time my dad pinned an i like ike button on my chest until trump i had to man up and make the change not easy but they changed first  at penzeys we believe cooking set our humanity in motion our nearly one million years gathered together around the fire taught us true strength does not come from driving others away but from welcoming others in the kindness of tens of thousands of generations  of cooks created our humanity but racism sexism and homophobia can all too easily undermine the goodness cooks work so selflessly to create in the world as a business of cooks we have decided for better or worse we wont sit idly by while this happens yesterday i was forwarded an email that stated that i had called all republicans racists and anarchists i also received another email that said your comments echo those of the desperate left who have no message for the nation other than that of all trump supporters are racist first off i dont believe any human is truly an anarchist how is anarchy something you can believe in not to say that people havent posed as anarchists to create a reason to justify crackdowns or possibly simply to get dates but no ive never called republicans anarchists and on the charge that im somehow echoing others calling all supporters of the president racists i dont think i was echoing anyone on that notion im pretty sure i was right there hitching the horses to that bandwagon one week after the  election i wrote in an email the open embrace of racism by the republican party in this election is now unleashing a wave of ugliness unseen in this country for decades the american people are taking notice let us commit to giving the people a better choice our kindness really is our strength in sifting through the replies to that email it was clear that though not intended a good number of people seemed to sincerely believe in my statement i was calling all republicans racists in the replies from those republicans who did not vote for the party is nominee i sensed genuine pain at having the strength of character to not go along with what was happening but nonetheless be grouped in with those who did i apologized and said you are your party is future and you deserve my admiration and respect and your country is as well i did go on for the rest of you you just voted for an openly racist candidate for the presidency of the united states of america in your defense most of you did so without thinking of the consequences of your candidate is racism because for most of you the heartbreaking destruction racism causes has never been anything you or your loved ones have had to experience but the thing is elections have their consequences this is no longer sixty years ago whether any of us like it or not for the next four years the  of this country who did not just vote for an openly racist candidate are going to treat you like you are the kind of person who would vote for an openly racist candidate you can get angry at everyone else for treating you like you just did the thing you just did or you can take responsibility for your actions and begin to make amends two years and tens of thousands of emails trying to convince me otherwise havent voting in the st century for what paul ryan labeled before the election textbook racism is indeed an act of racism the impact on all americans whatever their skin tone of saying you are fine with open racism or at least dont see how it should disqualify a candidate for the presidency of the united states of america is a very real and very racist impact caused by your vote does committing a racist act make you a racist i think the answer to that comes in your response to what you have done and in what you do going forward where my thinking has changed in these past two years is that i no longer believe you have to go out of your way to make amends for who you voted for in the past election all you have to do to make amends for helping to put the president in the white house is to stop supporting him and those who enable him for reasons i still have not quite figured out our last post really took off and now has over  comments in those comments are many much like the one this post starts with that speak to the difficulty of choosing the values the writer was raised with over loyalty to the party they were raised to believe in thats not an easy stepmore of a leap really it takes strength as another customer put it dont let the label you have slapped on yourself not reflect the truth of what you believe i grew up in a republican family and heck even my mom isnt republican anymore right now the president is going to great lengths to distance himself from the language of hate that he uses towards immigrants the press his previous opponents and pretty much any american that lives outside the narrow demographic of his support instead of taking responsibility for his words hes pushing the false notion that those who oppose him are the ones driven by hate and anger this simply isnt true hate doesnt drive people to work for racial equality transgender rights or the welcoming of asylum seekers what drives us to care about others is our humanity something cooks have in abundance from the likes and warm positive comments received by those coming to grips with the reality that holding onto their beliefs means letting go of their party i can tell you that you wont find any hate on the other side just kind decent people looking to support you for your courage now really is the time to choose who you want to be and what you want to stand for and my thanks to all the penzeys supporters for the kindness strength and compassion found in your comments your spirit makes what we do possible dont forget through monday  i will vote kind boxes  turkish oregano and  bavarian seasoning tuesday we will be closed and giving our people a paid holiday to vote if you have a business you should do this too no coupons or codes needed for any of these offers in our stores or online at you can see the  value vote kind box here the regularly  turkish oregano here and the regularly  bavarian seasoning over here we are doing the i will vote boxes as part of our get out the vote efforts they are really nice the turkish oregano is great and great oregano makes for a good life the turkish people do a good job with so much including oregano and investigating the murder of journalists was a reporter for an american newspaper killed because with americas reduced standing in the world these past two years they thought they could get away with it or did they do this to win favor with a president that time and again has encouraged his supporters to commit violence against those that report on his actions either way this is not good our thanks to the quality investigative work of the turkish government for exposing this in a way where our president has to deal with it and bavarian seasoning too i love how so many americans have tried to figure out how to respond to what is happening and how to use their skill set to make a difference a customer sent me this link to a truly great example from pbs travel host rick steves maybe its just coincidence that has mr steves addressing so very effectively the rise of fascism in europe at just this time but im guessing its not one of the points he makes is our belief that it cant happen here it can only happen in places like germany is simply wrong germany had great art they cared enough to create a great food culture they invented kindergarten the reality is if it could happen there it could happen anywhere watch this if you have the chance and pass it along to others this is amazing work thanks for the recommendation and thanks for having the kindness to care for the world around you you really do heal the world bill penzey billpenzeyscom liking this post liking our fb page and more importantly leaving a comment helps overcome the extra hurdles our posts face because of our political belief that cooking is what happens when you care about people with what this week is sure to be please share this with anyone you know who could use a reminder that many who once supported this are now turning away this is a time for hope and please share the importance of voting you are more respected than you imagine you have the power to get out the vote of those around you please use it thanks,1

"members of commission vii dpr ri and head of bph migas support the use of lng for railway fuel
palembang member of commission vii dprri h yulian gunhar and head of bph migas m fanshurullah asa and bph migas committee ahmad rizal made a working visit to south sumatra province in order to carry out the function of supervising the oil and gas sector one of the work visit agendas in south sumatra is monitoring and supervising the use of certain types of fuel quotas jbt or subsidized diesel for consumers using passenger and goods public railways at pt kereta api persero divre iii palembang thursday  during the visit the director of facilities management of pt kereta api persero azahari
head of bph migas m fanshurullah asa on the occasion conveyed the subsidized diesel quota provided by bph migas to pt kai in  was  kl and the realization was  or  resulting in an overquota of  in  bph migas has provided a subsidized fuel quota for kai of  kl if multiplied by the retail selling price of rp  it is worth rp  trillion explained ifan a greeting for m fanshurullah asa
to prevent the occurrence of overquota in  the determination of the subsidized fuel quota is set every quarter for the first quarter the quota is set at  kl and the realization is  kl  then for the second quarter it was increased to  kl but due to the largescale social restrictions pspbb which had an impact on limiting train operations the realization was only  kl  for quarter iii the quota is the same as for quarter ii which is  kl explained ifan
ifan further said that he had checked that there was a freight train for export coal that uses subsidized fuel based on field checks there are freight trains for export coal to china india vietnam malaysia and brunei transporting an average of  million tons per month with fuel consumption of  thousand klmonth or around rp  billionmonth or  billion a year said ifan
ifan hopes that the use of subaidi diesel oil can be replaced with liquified natural gas lng so that fuel subsidies can be more efficient in addition to cheaper lng prices the use of lng is also cleaner energy
responding to this member of commission vii dpr ri from the pdip fraction for the south sumatra pdip dapil h yulian gunhar supports and encourages the use of liquefied natural gas or liquified natural gas lng as a rail fuel to be immediately implemented in the commercialization stage
just as the fuel oil subsidy is only for the indonesian people at home to move the economy so the use of freight trains for export commodities is not appropriate to be given a fuel subsidy therefore i support the use of lng as a fuel for trains replacing the use of diesel oil explained gunhar
according to gunhar the plan to use lng as a railway fuel has started since  which was marked by the signing of a memorandum of understanding between pt pertamina persero and pt kereta api indonesia persero pt kai on august   this is to support the government program in the context of energy diversification by converting the use of fuel to gas furthermore h yulian gunhar said that the use of lng as a train fuel has been used in several countries such as the usa canada russia and india
based on the results of the ddf lng trial on the power train carried out by pt kai persero in  witnessed by the head of the research and development agency of the ministry of energy and mineral resources showed a decline in consumption of diesel oil by  lng supply can be supplied from bontang with isotanks via sea and land routes
in addition to saving fuel costs the use of lng also has several advantages including as a clean and economical alternative fuel encouraging the use of natural gas in the country reducing imports and subsidies for diesel fuel diesel fuel reducing pollution caused by diesel engine emissions and extending the period maintenance of diesel engines so that maintenance costs are reduced
after making a working visit to pt kereta api persero divre iii palembang head of bph migas and the team made a field visit to pt bukit asam tanjung enim muara enim regency to see firsthand the operation of the coal transporting train and also to review the process of refueling for trains at the tanjung enim vhs facility

"on tuesday may   the chamber of deputies will decide on the effects of the compensation bonus act which will have a major and unfortunately negative impact on the financing of all municipalities cities and regions we managed to stop this law in the senate but the last word will be given to the deputies tomorrow
the estimated impact of the government is proposal on the revenues of the budgets of municipalities cities and regions will be a total of more than  billion crowns incomes in municipalities will be lower by  crowns per capita and in regions by  crowns per capita
help for selfemployed people and selfemployed people small businesses and their partners is in my opinion necessary and necessary the way in which the government of the czech republic withdraws this money to support these groups without prior warning from the local government budgets is in my opinion flawed and unacceptable
you may ask some of you why
the effects of all measures related to the covid  coronavirus pandemic on the functioning of the economy are also beginning to be reflected in the local government is tax revenues the ministry of finance estimates the drop in tax revenues in shared taxes at  compared to last year and this figure was published before the impact of the compensation bonus was calculated given the complete unpredictability of economic development i consider it reasonable and responsible to expect a revenue shortfall of up to  percent compared to 
coincidentally the liberec regional council will also discuss a fundamental change in the regional budget on tuesday which envisages a reduction in tax revenues this year to  billion crowns for comparison last year it was  billion in real terms you are all in a similar situation so you know how difficult it is to look for savings throughout the year savings and cuts will affect with some exceptions all parts of the region is budget from contributory organizations through the subsidy fund to the regional office is budget it is an extremely unpleasant but unfortunately unpleasant and necessary step
in the discussion and letters the ministry of finance uses the argument about rich municipalities cities and regions and billions of crowns in their accounts however this argument is only true in numbers and is used without three essential facts on the one hand these savings are mostly linked to ongoing and planned investments and serve among other things to prefinance european and national subsidies which are usually repaid only second these billions of savings in the accounts are only significant minorities especially large cities thirdly and finally the savings on the accounts of municipalities and counties are not state money and do not belong to it they belong to the citizens and are decided by municipal and regional representatives and they are significantly more visible than the money administered by ministries and other state institutions their management is significantly more efficient than the management and use of money demonstrated at the central level for a long time
the government supports and in my view correctly those groups of the population companies and entrepreneurs who have been affected by the measures and the resulting economic crisis municipalities cities and regions do not yet think of any support on the contrary we can listen to various statements that we will manage the situation simply and easily i consider this a mistake for a fundamental and gross mistake in this situation on the contrary immediate and direct support of municipal and regional budgets would help to start investments and repairs of municipal property schools roads and other infrastructure everywhere in the smallest village and remote town with the involvement of public control with the opportunity to engage in the work of small businesses sole proprietors and do it right away on the intentions they are ready
it would be enough to immediately involve only a small part of the planned state budget deficit of  billion crowns and create a entitlement subsidy for example  crowns per capita for municipalities and  crowns per capita for regions for repairs and property investments without the pointless bureaucracy associated with standard grant funds and billing by the end of  it would cost the state a maximum of  billion crowns in two years ie less than  of the planned deficit municipalities and regions would gain the certainty that they would not be left alone in economic trouble and were not afraid to invest the state would gain the support of more than  public investors and contracting authorities
finance minister schiller and prime minister babis talk about subsidies prepared by the ministries it is a promise whose seriousness and fulfillment we will be able to verify for ourselves in the coming months but what is certain now is the demands on project preparation the administration of the programs and the subsequent control of the applicants will postpone any assistance in time and complicate the matter
the coronavirus pandemic has affected the entire world the entire czech republic and all regions cities and municipalities no exceptions we have paid the cost of securing measures approved by the government in an emergency and beyond from our budgets these days we are preparing austerity budgets and thinking about how to deal with the economic crisis we are waiting for help from the state and it seems that our pleas are not yet completely understood",1

"rutherford institute warns of first amendment lawsuit after police threaten  fines over drivein church
the rutherford institute has warned that it will consider filing a first amendment lawsuit if police continue to threaten a new york church with prosecution and  fines for holding drivein worship services that adhere to social distancing guidelines
in a legal letter to the chief of police for the town of massena ny rutherford institute attorneys point out that while federal and state governments have adopted specific restrictive measures in an effort to decelerate the spread of the covid virus the current public health situation has not resulted in the suspension of fundamental constitutional rights such as religious freedom freedom of speech and the right of assembly institute attorneys also pointed out that such a ban is an overbroad restriction on first amendment rights as long as other similar drivein activities are allowed for example the state is restrictions allow for gathering in convenience stores beverage stores hardware stores and drivethru restaurant lines
while we appreciate the dedication and personal sacrifices of so many emergency personnel who are working to combat the spread of this virus that does not justify allowing government officials to needlessly and heedlessly trample all over the first amendment said constitutional attorney john w whitehead president of the rutherford institute certainly if government officials have determined that it is safe to gather in convenience stores beverage stores hardware stores and drivethru restaurant takeout lines while adhering to social distancing guidelines there is no reason to single out church drivein services where worshippers remain in their cars from the list of approved activities

youre telling me i spent nothing out of pocket practically did nothing and now i have a brandnew solar roof jim had been outside over an hour cycling between a state of disbelief and pure accomplishment he repeated the same motions over and over look down at this electricity bill then back up at his brandnew tripleblack solar roof bill roof bill roof how could it have been this easy jims wife lisa finally dragged him back inside just before dark just last month he was watching the news something his wife lisa also must drag him away from dreaming of more ways he could make an impact he was always trying to find the next best thing to lower his carbon footprint on the planet but easy was never the word hed use to describe it easy not so much but totally worth it hed bought a nice electric car that took forever and a day putting up with the car salesmen switched to cloth everything napkins diapers handkerchiefs kindagross but saving the planet gets messy and if you can believe this he had zero paper mail coming in but that was no sweat for jim a little inconvenience was all part of being environmentally conscious and living as sustainable as possible but this this new solarpowered roof he marveled at his tripleblack panels glimmering in the sunshine knowing it would make the largest impact of all his endeavors and how quickly and easily it all happened he woke up one morning about a month before checked his email and hopped on facebook scrolling through the usual news soon enough he saw an advertisement for wwwmarlyandsolarproscom and decided it was time to look at how feasible it would be to install solar panels on his roof hed been avoiding getting a solar estimate for one because he didnt trust his environmentally motivated impulse buying habits and for two because he thought itd be too expensive out of pocket but it turns out it was the easiest thing hed done so far he entered his address to see if his roof faced the right direction for solar and he immediately received a ton of info on what rebates and incentives were still available turns out maryland is on the forefront of everything solar jim was late to the solar party but not too late his roof qualified for  financing which was refreshing considering what he was paying in utility transmission and delivery charges  of his installed system was paid for in tax credits alone plus his homes value went up and the year bumpertobumper warranty is fully transferable to the next homeowner a future millennial owner will be swept off their feet with this solarized home see if your roof qualifies here httpbitlysolarsurvey he did everything online a friendly surveyor came and confirmed the installation specs and everything was installed while he was at the ravens game and lisa stayed home with the kids all she got was a knock on the door and some kind folks told her theyd be working on her home but she never really heard anything else from them until everything was completed a few hours later when jim and lisa got their first electricity bill they were dumbfounded after running the numbers they were owed money back from their utility company jim thought why wasnt the whole world on this already but then he remembered how long it took him hung up on the thought that it was going to be a painful process when in fact it was much easier than what hed made up in his own mind he like many maryland had the wrong impression this whole time about one of the best financial decisions he would ever make but all of that was in his rearview mirrors now and it all began with jim qualifying his own roof online perhaps its time you take the easy route like jim it doesnt get any better than right now for going solar in maryland click the link below to take your own solar roof quiz httpbitlysolarsurvey,1

"the democrat and republican regime in washington dc is irredeemable
the reign of democrat and republican politicians in dc is irredeemable we must stop electing them our nation must emancipate itself from these parties that have long abandoned responsible governance
we often hear our opinion class decry the government for not being able to agree on what is important and get things done we focus on the squabbles the mudslinging the namecalling we lament our bitter partisan divide
the truth is that democrats and republicans agree on just about everything that matters here are two examples of an unjust government that is supported overwhelmingly by both parties
our military budget is eighthundredbillion dollars per year that is more than russia china and the next  nations of the world combined to spend on their military
we are not at risk for military invasion the world is two most massive oceans surround us and two friendly nationsneither of which is a world military power there is not anything approaching a good reason to spend that kind of our gdp on the military this spending is wholly indefensible and utterly absurd it is like living in san diego and squandering a quarter of your budget on coldweather gear
before covid when times were good democrats and republicans were spending more than a trillion dollars a year more than they took in it did not matter who controlled the white house senate or house the spending bills passed with vast bipartisan majorities
both parties are so furiously printing and spending money that it is nearly impossible to keep up with the actual national debt it is somewhere around  trillion that is about k of debt per taxpayer our government owes  for every  that exists in circulation pile up every last bit of our currency and we owe x that amount
this malfeasance and mismanagement of government are wholly unsustainable and indefensible
democrats and republicans control the congress that has made this mess we must kick them out of office and that begins with this campaign

we have had a failure of integrity in government in the nt in recent times we are no longer surprised to hear about donors to political parties receiving massive financial returns from the government after the election
i want to be part of a clean government that genuinely represents the people who vote me in i want to be part of a government that makes the people of the nt proud i want to restore dignity to our parliament i want to be part of a government with integrity
i wrote the constitution and the vision statement of territory alliance with authenticity and integrity in mind in order to genuinely serve the people of the nt

they put  people into technical unemployment and reduced the number of races
instead of arbitrarily reducing the number of vehicles that the stb takes out on the route in order to avoid the congestion of the type in the picture they had to rethink the traffic charts so as to ensure sufficient means of transport on the routes where there is demand and in the intervals times when there is demand
this is exactly what will have to be done after may  when the individual traffic restrictions imposed for the management of the covid epidemic will be relaxed
our lives have changed and we no longer have to be in buses trams or trolleybuses or in stations man by man
the social distance will require the decrease of the passenger density in the means of public transport and consequently the increase of the number of vehicles in order to ensure an adequate transport capacity
so why put people in technical unemployment isnt it better to prepare more vehicles
and lower the number of directors their salaries and the allowances of ca members who cut the leaf on dogs or think such stupid measures as can be seen

it appears to be intentional as to why things are the way they are in oklahoma the majority of state legislators including my opponent leslie osborn and glen mulready currently running for insurance commissioner made the following law for wages i thought you would want to read it for yourself i would like to stress to you that all oklahomans that need help if they do not make enough in their wages to meet basic critical needs like food shelter and health care receiv  e tax dollars through state programs people question why we have stagnant wages so how is putting an unnecessary burden on taxpayers to support sub par wages to protect poor business models okay to continue oklahoma is current minimum wage is  per hour the same as federal minimum wage oklahoma is minimum wage applies to any employer that grosses  or more a year or hires ten or more employees oklahoma does not have a unique minimum wage and instead adopts the federal minimum wage by reference oklahoma sets a special minimum wage of  per hour for work not covered by the federal minimum wage including full time students any employees under the age of  who are enrolled as fulltime students are exempt from oklahoma is minimum wage law but the special minimum wage of  per hour still applies additional exempt employees include farm and ranch workers maids government employees railroad workers temporary parttime employees feed store employees and deputy sheriffs exempt means they are unprotected because they are not required to be paid the minimum wage additional minimum wage statutes allow oklahoma employers to deduct the cost of uniforms from their employee is wages if employers fail to pay the legal minimum wage to an employee they could be liable to pay up to double the amount of wages owed to the employee oklahoma employers may not pay you under  per hour unless you or your occupation are specifically exempt from the minimum wage under state or federal law again the burden of a business that only prospers by sacrificing the well being of its employees should not be placed upon the shoulders of oklahoma wage earners,1

the case for change
from dan schneckenburger fair hill taxpayer joe carabetta perryville taxpayer may  
four years ago both of us challenged alan mccarthy in the  republican primary although he was victorious and became county executive both of us have a unique perspective on the record of the incumbent
although alan campaigned as a conservative and would fight taxes he significantly raised both the property and income tax his first year he has also increased local government spending every year and refuses to hold the tax revenue stream to constant yield this year which will raise the tax burden on all residents this man misled the public during this  campaign and if he was honest he would not have been elected and we both still have his campaign mailers stating he would fight tax increases
both joe and i have disagreed on many different policy issues over the years we certainly agree that our tax burden is too high and we should make it the top priority to reduce taxes it is impossible to ignore the  million surpluses in  and  as an indication that our tax rate is too high even in this fiscal year the county has an additional surplus although we both are residents of other states we still own and pay property taxes in cecil county
that is why we both support and endorse danielle hornberger for county executive in the  primary on june  she is a woman of high integrity who has made it a top priority to put the cecil county taxpayer first with the economic reduction that has occurred as a result of covid  we need a leader who will limit government spending support all of our first responders and bring true conservative values for the future vision of the county this is why we urge all our past supporters to support ms hornberger in the june  primary mail in only we cannot afford another four years of a mccarthy regime",1

high crimes the impeachment of donald trump i dont think that donald trump should be impeached for throwing paper towels at the devastated victims of hurricane maria in puerto rico and telling them to have a good time i dont think that donald trump should be impeached because the bereaved widow of a dead us soldier says that trump told her that her husband knew what he signed up for i dont think that donald trump should be impeached because he has confessed that hed like to date his daughter in sum i dont think that donald trump should be impeached because he is a jackwagon  quite possibly the worst jackwagon ever to hold any public office in the united states he is our idi amin our own idiot amin minus the cannibalism at least as far as we know but is there any doubt that if maralago did offer human flesh on the menu trump would tout it as the best the very best human flesh ever available anywhere absolutely primo human flesh better than even what was for sale during the siege of leningrad but i do believe that donald trump should be impeached  for the numerous high crimes and misdemeanors that he has committed donald trump should be impeached because as doonesbury once said of richard nixon trump is guilty guilty guilty yes yes i understand that its tempting to say that trump should be impeached because it seems as though an evil clown from a stephen king novel has wandered into the white house its tempting to say that trump should be impeached because as president he is the woat worst of all time you dont have to take my word for this the american political science association apsa is a nonpartisan organization of political scientists after donald trumps first year in office a survey of the members of apsa named donald j trump the worst president of all time president andrew johnson who was impeached and almost removed from office ranked fifthworst president richard nixon who resigned after the us house judiciary committee voted for impeachment ranked th worst president bill clinton who was impeached by the house and then like andrew johnson won the conviction vote in the senate and remained in office was ranked th best read more wwwimpeachbookcom so yes i understand the impulse to say that trump should be impeached because he is a terrible horrible no good very bad president but when it comes to the impeachment of donald trump we can and we should be more specific than that donald trump is impeachable because the constitution of the united states says that he is for the reasons stated therein the us constitution says that the impeachable offenses are  treason  bribery  high crimes and  misdemeanors now i must concede that we have a president who will admit to nothing no collusion no obstruction if trump started to speak in farsi he would insist thereafter that there was no confusion if he accidentally dropped a nuclear weapon on philadelphia he would maintain that there was no destruction no confusion no destruction it doesnt matter in fact weve had a lot of truly awful public officials who have nevertheless insisted that they were as pure as the driven snow or in trumps case as pure as the orange glow it doesnt matter it hasnt mattered and it shouldnt matter it doesnt take a confession to find someone guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors in fact our own angry creamsicle is the capo di tutti i capi boss of all the bosses when it comes to impeachable offenses he is benedict donald historically impeachable offenses fall into these nine categories  divided loyalty  corruption  obstruction of justice  other abuse of power  campaign misconduct  sexual misconduct  tax evasion  conflicts of interest and  conduct unbecoming a public official particularly bad hombres as donald trump would call them have been guilty of two types of impeachable offenses on this list in trumps case you can find impeachable acts for all nine donald trump literally is guilty of every impeachable offense when a public official commits high crimes and misdemeanors or in trumps case revels in them what else are you going to do  ignore them look the other way close your eyes and hope that they disappear for those of us old enough to experience object permanence that just doesnt work anymore read more wwwimpeachbookcom how does donald trump stack up against the other miscreants who have soiled american history when you measure this scalawaginchief against all the other scalawags does his scala wag the most is trumps political stench  eau de trump his branded cologne  as putrid as theirs trump once tried to sell a trump cologne in a phallusshaped bottle the chicago tribune reported that it smelled like a strip club in sum is this president unprecedented look into it and you will find that donald trump has committed high crimes and misdemeanors that are as bad as or worse than every other official who has committed high crimes and misdemeanors therefore he should be impeached and removed from office qed and ill go one step further if you take an oath of office to uphold the constitution  as i did as every member of congress has done  then thats how you should see it too if you want to read all about it then you can buy the book  high crimes the impeachment of donald trump at wwwimpeachbookcom and as donald trump might say treasons greetings,1

take a look because this will help you better understand who your prospect is and what the biggest opportunity is in your market when i present this idea of prospect awareness to our clients amp students i present it as a pyramid on the bottom of the pyramid is the unaware prospect thats the biggest part of the market when you go up a level the area shrinks and then you go up another level and as you move up and up the size of the marketplace  the number of people at that level  decreases but it becomes easier to convert them as we go down levels  to the bottom unaware layer of the pyramid  that is our biggest opportunity because its the biggest universe there are more people but the reason its harder to convert at the bottom is because there is a lot more belief that we have to create in the minds of our prospects and this is the thing that i want to share with you today what prospects need to be educated and which do not the individual who is at the top or close to the top already has existing beliefs  they have understanding and insights this guy  on the other hand when an individual is completely unaware like this guy  we have to lead them through the entire string of beliefs there are things we have to say to them that we dont have to say to the person who is at the problem level of awareness for example the individual who is at the problem level of awareness we dont have to educate them to the fact that they have a problem they know they have a problem theyre already aware of the fact that they have a problem the person who goes on google and searches for flood repair  or something like that already knows they have a problem whereas the person who is unaware that there is flooding going on behind the sheetrock we have to educate them thats one additional belief  in this simplistic example  that we have to establish with that individual and still the higher up on the level of awareness the fewer beliefs that we have to establish because theyve already been established on the lower awareness level how direct do you need to be in your message the last thing i really want you to start to see is that as you go higher on the levels of awareness the more direct you can be in your ideas and talk for the funnel so for instance lets say we have a prospect who is aware that they have had a flood and theyve got damage and they need it repaired and now theyre searching on google for flood repair with a certain type of method for that person we dont have to start with an indirect big idea that is slanted toward being intellectually interesting and invoking curiosity instead jump into their thought process at a place thats appropriate for them lets begin the dialogue there whereas for the unaware individual we cant start like that we cant jump in and have an ad that says what you need to know about flood repair or the six reasons why we can get your home back to its original condition in  hours or less guaranteed you cant start there with the completely unaware because they are unaware we have to take the scenic route and thats what brings me back to why the lower you are on the awareness scale the more difficult it is to convert because we need to establish more beliefs in that type of prospect and we need to have a big marketing idea that takes the scenic route we need to find a big marketing idea that is intellectually interesting to create a level of engagement so that eventually we can lead them into the direct hook something such as here are the five reasons why you want us but we cant start there with the unaware understanding prospect levels of awareness is the key to being able to create the right message at the right time get this right and youll have them lining up at your door so the question is how do you find a big marketing idea that grabs attention and allows you to acquire new customers even in the most competitive markets if you are serious about capitalizing on this biggest and most untapped opportunity in the market i strongly suggest you grab a copy of my new book it is called how to find your big marketing idea and it is just  on the next page this will be a total game changer for you,1

making a case for joe biden more than just that he polls well against donald trump and let us start off by saying that those polls should not be ignored joe biden has had a consistent edge over the other democratic candidates in headtohead polling against trump in national surveys going back to last march biden kicks trump is butt additionally biden polls much better against trump than other candidates in swing states but right now let us focus on some things that biden brings to the table in terms of the sheer number of issues biden influenced during his time in the obama administration foreign policy and fiscal issues are among many items in biden is portfolio back in  it was biden is office that primarily orchestrated the handover of iraq to the iraqis it is biden is view of afghanistan that bit by bit came to dominate thinking inside the  withdrawal plan on financial reform it was biden who prodded an indecisive obama to embrace paul volcker is idea of barring banks from risky trading according to austan goolsbee formerly the head of obama is council of economic advisers biden also tilted the discussion in favor of a bailout of the big three auto companies according to jared bernstein biden is former economic adviser i think he made a difference in president is thinking bernstein said he understood the importance of the auto companies to their communities and throughout the country thanks to his decades in the senate biden came to the job of vp with a deep understanding of the way the federal government operates which enabled him to oversee projects that spanned different agencies and different branches most importantly he was in charge of implementing the american recovery and reinvestment act recovery act which was one of the administrations great unsung successes it involved a huge amount of work and coordination and by every account biden performed exceptionally well at it just the fact that they managed to distribute over threequarters of a trillion dollars without any major scandals of graft or theft was an extraordinary accomplishment biden led the successful administration effort to gain senate approval for the new start treaty strategic arms reduction treaty this is a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the united states and the russian federation with the formal name of measures for the further reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms it was signed on april th  in prague and after ratification entered into force on february th  it is expected to last at least until  biden declared his support for marriage equality on national television in   three days before barack obama did hes been a champion of lgbtq rights and made big waves when he said its going to become a political liability in the near term for an individual to say i oppose gay marriage mark my words in a  interview with the human rights campaigns chad griffin his support for the lgbtq community continued throughout his vice presidency biden officiated a samesex wedding at the vice presidential residence in washington dc marrying two longtime white house staffers buzzfeed reported at the  state of the union address obama announced the establishment of cancer moonshot an initiative led by biden that would accelerate cancer research making more therapies available to more patients while improving our ability to prevent cancer and detect it in early stages according to the national cancer institute moonshot came almost a year after bidens son beau died of brain cancer in may of  at age  biden is  violence against women act was reauthorized in   and  the act led to further related developments in the creation of the white house council on women and girls begun in obama is first term as well as the white house task force to protect students from sexual assault begun in january  with biden as cochair along with valerie jarrett biden has a strong stance on sexual assault for example biden stated to a victim of sexual assault at stanford university you did it  in the hope that your strength might prevent this crime from happening to someone else your bravery is breathtaking he has also taken legality into the situation biden issued federal guidelines while presenting a speech at the university of new hampshire he stated that no means no if you are drunk or you are sober no means no if you are in bed in a dorm or on the street no means no even if you said yes at first and you changed your mind no means no biden was selected to head up a special task force on the issue of gun control after a school shooting at a newtown connecticut elementary school biden delivered solutions for reducing gun violence across the nation to president obama in january  he helped craft  actions that the president could take on the issue using his power of executive order among other recommendations among  presidential candidates biden has the longest legislative record on climate change he pioneered some of the earliest climate change legislation in us history his first climate change bill introduced in  did not pass in the senate but the following year a version of bidens legislation survived as an amendment to a state department funding bill president ronald reagan went on to sign it into law the upshot of bidens global climate protection act was to call on the president to set up a task force to plan how to mitigate global warming the measure also asked him to make climate change a higher priority item on the ussoviet agenda biden supports governmental funding to find new energy sources he cosponsored the sense of the senate resolution calling on the united states to be a part of the united nations climate negotiations and the boxersanders global warming pollution reduction act the most stringent climate bill in the united states senate under obama the recovery act implemented by biden made the largest single investment in clean energy in history providing more than  billion in strategic clean energy investments and tax incentives to promote job creation and the deployment of lowcarbon technologies and leveraging approximately  billion in private and other nonfederal capital for clean energy investments joe is skilled at reaching across the aisle to get things done he can sit down in foreign policy or other issues and find a common interest and drive the ideas forward look at what he did with jesse helms and strom thurmond in passing the chemical weapons treaty and crime bills respectively in the s his former chief of staff and later successor ted kaufman noted back then i mean jesse helms and strom thurmond you do not get more conservative than that let us remember biden is debate performance in  he faced his republican counterpart representative paul ryan in the lone  vice presidential debate on october th in danville kentucky there he made a feisty emotional defense of the obama administration is record and energetically attacked the republican ticket this helped the obama campaign regain momentum after obama is first lackluster debate performance biden is most important role within the obama administration was to question assumptions playing a contrarian role obama said that the best thing about joe is that when we get everybody together he really forces people to think and defend their positions to look at things from every angle and that is very valuable for me another senior obama advisor said biden is always prepared to be the skunk at the family picnic to make sure we are as intellectually honest as possible and on and on and on is joe biden a perfect human being of course not who is but is biden an intelligent man who could bring a lot of important experience and skill to the white house at a time when we desperately need to be rid of donald trump hell yes and let us once again emphasize biden polls very well against trump compared to other democratic candidates who either have far less experience are too ideologically extreme or both i say we need joe biden,1

lets declare war on israel from the title of this article i surmise your thoughts are that i am muslim i am an arab sympathizer i am antisemitic i am crazy or that i am all of these things however i am not one of them instead i am a christian and a nd generation american who grew up believing that the united states is the greatest nation in the world this is what i grew up believing but today i no longer think this is true in order for a nation to be great  two things are necessary it must provide a viable and good life for most of its citizens and it must be a positive leader on the world stage standing up for truth justice and the rule of law among nations it is the latter that i presently have problems with from my perspective the united states has become a rogue nation that lies to the world lies to its citizens and has grievously trampled the rule of law between nations my sincere belief is that we have become this way because of our irrational support of the nation of israel complicating any discussion about jewish political issues is the holocaust where six million jews died horrible deaths at the hands of adolph hitler and his nazis surely something had to be done for a group of people who so grievously and wrongfully suffered in  great brittan helped create the nation of israel most people at the time thought this was the right thing to do and indeed most still feel this way today however the truth is that creation of the nation of israel was a blunder that has kept the world at war for the past  years with no end in sight to the carnage and destruction stop and think about this for the first time in the history of the world a coalition of world governments agreed to establish a homeland for the jews in a land occupied by mostly arab peoples a land that was fought over by european powers against the arab world during the crusades for almost  years in light of this reality didnt anyone think how the arab people would feel about this decision when it was being considered apparently not at the time the allies were swimming in the euphoria of their victory over the axis powers and could care less about what the arabs thought or felt the truth is that while creation of the nation of israel was a great victory and joy to the jews it was a defeat and an insulting affront to the arabs however the situation is much more complicated than this because of how this affected the palestinian people the palestinian people were a majority in palestine and the jews lived and worked beside them in peace for centuries this changed in  suddenly with british assistance jews began immigrating to palestine in droves became the majority and formed their own government and guess what because the jews believed they are gods chosen people living under this new government were two classes of people citizens who were jews and everybody else this is exactly the same situation that jews lived with in nazi germany under hitler and blacks lived with in south africa under the afrikaners furthermore the israeli doctrine of the right of return forced palestinians to surrender their homes and the lands they occupied for centuries to newly immigrated jews who never lived in israel before the situation just described is the crux of the problem that has driven the arab israeli conflict and world terrorism for the past  years the jews believe that they have a god given right to palestine and have displaced palestinians who have lived in the area for generations the jews base their claims upon the torah and the palestinian claims are based upon a longstanding right of ownership for reasons which to say the least are convoluted the united states has taken up the israeli cause against the arabs this turned into a tragedy after  years of fighting and war there is no end in sight to the destruction suffering and carnage carefully think about this the united states is the most powerful and militarily advanced nation in the world no other nation can stand up to our military superiority with this great power comes great responsibility a responsibility to promote justice in the world and peace among nations every living american should know and understand that this is our greatest responsibility however the truth is that in this we have failed we have failed because for the past  years we have fought wars not in the interest of peace and justice but instead to further the interests of zionism and the injustices associated with this wrongful and backward political philosophy we stood up against slavers hitler and the afrikaners because of their belief that they were better than everyone else so why are we today supporting a group of people who are guilty of this same injustice especially when these people have assumed the right to take for their own homes and land that does not belong to them what is zionism it is the belief that the jews are the chosen people of god and as such should have a nation of their own in the land god gifted to their forebears the jews in the old testament of the bible the problem is that the united states is fighting wars to support these ends unfortunately in order to win these wars the arab people must be forced to accept that palestine is no longer theirs that the piece of dirt called the holy land is now the property of israel and that they must demonstrate they are good people by accepting what israel and the united states is forcing upon them the truth is that every arab we kill because they are a terrorist is a person fighting for their honor and the homes and lands that rightfully belong to the palestinian people in other words we are killing people fighting for the same ideals that americans fought for in our revolutionary war the united states and israel is the invading army not the arabs this being true how is it possible for america to claim the high ground in this conflict how is it possible for americans to believe that the best way to bring peace and justice into this world is by forcing the arab world to accept injustice lets declare war on israel when we do and israel sues for peace as they surly will as a condition of peace we should demand that israel disavows their doctrine of jewish superiority and the racist doctrine of the jewish right of return also we should demand that israel grants equal citizenship to all its citizens including the palestinians in america we subscribe to the notions of freedom of and freedom from religion this being the case it is absurd that we are fighting to establish a religious state where equality under the law does not exist what is worse through our unholy alliance with israel we are forcing the other nations of the world into accepting what is best described as a rogue nation among the community of nations the america i love and served should be a force for peace and justice in the world unfortunately this is not the case america has become a tyrant ruling the world by subterfuge

"if covid teaches us anything it should be that the cost of animal agriculture is too high it is time to stop bailing out the industry and start funding a shift to plantbased farming
if you have been watching the news you have probably heard about the virus infecting hundreds of slaughterhouse workers farmers dumping milk and culling animals and millions being spent on bailouts including
 million in agrirecovery for cattle and hog producers  million for each with the remaining  million to be determined
 million for slaughterhouse upgrades
 million to buy food that cant be sold
 million in increased borrowing capacity for the canadian dairy commission and
 million for a federal pandemic relief package to fish food allied workers ffaw
animal agriculture is as nonessential as it gets even without the threat of zoonotic diseases it causes catastrophic damage to the environment our health and animals
it may be politically expedient right now to prop the industry up along with airlines and fossil fueldependent sectors but doing so without requiring urgent and fundamental change is essentially subsidizing the emergence of the next pandemic
rampant deforestation uncontrolled expansion of animal agriculture and wildlife exploitation have created a perfect storm for the spillover of zoonotic diseases
we need to think beyond damagecontrol to plan for the future business as usual will not work business as usual for pandemics means waiting for the next one to emerge and hoping for a vaccine that is not a good strategy
it is time to stop bailing out the industry and start funding a shift to plantbased farming

dear mp name
i am writing as a resident of community to ask for your support to create policies that will enable a shift in canada is agricultural sector to mitigate catastrophic climate change
we now know that animal agriculture is a major contributor of greenhouse gas ghg emissions and is one of the leading causes of climate change
in order for canada to meet our ghg emission targets before  it is imperative that we start planning for a and in order to ensure the agricultural sector in canada is not disrupted and continues to thrive we must start enacting policies to enable this shift now
we are asking the federal government to include in the next federal budget meaningful policies and funding that will
one way the government can do this is by the dairy industry for example has a massive environmental footprint and is struggling but because it receives millions in government subsidies every year there is little incentive for farmers to transition if the government redirected just some of the funds used to subsidize the industry to help dairy farmers transition we would be securing the agricultural sector for the future while taking critical steps to combat climate change
canada is taking on important and bold initiatives to address ghg emissions across a range of sectors and industries but if we are to meet our ghg targets one of those initiatives must include a plan to transition to more sustainable agriculture",1

"may st 
 am
morning note how we are recovering
it is nice to return after a holiday weekend and the market has positioned itself to open up about  points
there are still many questions about the stock market and the impact of covid we saw that in the shakiness of trading on friday before a holiday weekend
some investors are still feeling timid and would rather be out of the market before a holiday weekend
however as we are seeing today a penalty is being applied if an investor is looking today at trying to buy into a  point rally day that could go higher this has happened several times since early march and it also happened in the early part of  and that ended up being a great year for the market
in midmarch through today i have been advising clients to reposition some holdings to pick up some great name companies that were in a position to benefit from current market conditions
in the  to  days some of those positions have increased substantially and in some accounts greater than  i have shared my thoughts to nonclients and advised them to review any investments with high expenses or poorperformance in their portfolios and to make changes
the market recovery has been selective but investors should not be surprised companies like microsoft zoom beyond meat amd facebook the g sector and mediacommunication holdings have done extremely well
i have had concerns about financials and the insurance sector during this time since low interest rates do not favor these industries at the moment also they have not performed well
if investors check their mutual fund holding they may see that those funds hold big positions in financials and should not be surprised if those mutual funds are negative for the year
the big question on most people is minds is when will we get a vaccine for the virus
i am not as focused on that question since more than  different companies are working on a vaccine and im confident that more than one will become a reality
by removing this question from the table it allows me to focus on the fundamentals of stocks bonds mutual funds and other investments
in about  days i will be releasing my views on the second half of  as most know i write a report for the first half of the year and the second report comes out in july while these are not predictions they are a researchbased overview of what is impacting the market during the first half of the year and how it will impact the second half
i have spoken to some investors during the shutdown of the state and they have not looked at their own investments some take the position that everything is done and when the market recovers so will their portfolio
this could never be more wrong by making some subtle changes to a portfolio during this time could have a significant change in a portfolio imagine selling one or two investments that have decline and picking up two or three new positions that are up since march by greater than  it would have a positive impact
i would not be surprised by an investor making some dramatic moves during the lows and finding out that their portfolio is up  or  ytd
we handle k plans in our office for local businesses and when i hear nonclient employees talk about their k becoming a k i get concerned since none of our client k accounts had such declines
once again if you are an employer use this time to review your kb plans and check the expense fees being assessed and the investments in your plan
many times i will hear an employer say my fees are not that high i then review what the employees are paying and its  to  yearly
second they purchased a cookiecutter plan not knowing whether those are topperforming funds or not
personally i want to hear from more than the company or its agent telling me they have all top funds i would rather do some research and then by doing a comparison among all mutual funds in that category make that claim
our current rally should continue on the data that i am seeing but as we approach july i believe i will have a better understanding of what is potentially ahead for the rest of the year
i hope everyone has a great week and continues to stay safe
if you have a question about your kb or your investments in general our first consultion is free and there is noobligation on the part of the investor
call our office at  or our cell

"our public health policy director molly rauch speaks out in the hill on yet another way us epa administrator andrew wheeler is ignoring sound science and attacking the health and safety of americans
in the midst of a deadly respiratory pandemic that preys on those with underlying heart and lung disease epa has refused to strengthen national standards for particle pollution a lethal but invisible form of air pollution that causes heart attacks stroke asthma cancer and premature death
particle pollution is made up of microscopic flecks of solids liquids and gases it comes from cars trucks factories power plants and fires and it is one of the most consequential pollutants regulated under the clean air act also called particulate matter soot or pm  this deadly substance wreaks havoc in part because it is so minute the particles can pass directly into the bloodstream from the lungs triggering serious health conditions including premature death some experts estimate that it is responsible for  deaths each year in the us
across the country most areas are in compliance with national standards for particle pollution which is good news but scientific knowledge advances over time and regulatory agencies like the epa need to take that knowledge into account when setting and updating national standards despite us air quality having dramatically improved over the past several decades it is now abundantly clear that particle pollution standards must be strengthened to better protect breathers everywhere
thankfully the reality of scientific advancement is baked into the clean air act under which the epa is required to periodically review and update national standards for pollutants but right now epa administrator andrew wheeler is flouting the requirements of the clean air act and the mission of his agency tens of thousands of lives could be saved if wheeler would follow the science and prioritize our health

v for victory pins yours this weekend at penzeys yup wednesday was a huge victory for all of america in the struggle against the rising tide of nationalism and injustice of course for supporters of the republican party wednesday was like a big ole rock crashing through their hornets nest they are now out and angry and energized and looking for someone to sting some of this is not pretty but all of it is good they are out of their propaganda bubble now and finally mix  ing it up with those from outside their right wing echo world good will come from all of this this is a time for hope from the combative responses ive received to our post and emails since wednesdays historic results virtually all of them want to argue facts that make their support of this administration right or at least reasonable but of course they are having some real issues wrapping their heads around the reality that those facts simply dont exist even before his impeachment sent him into his current overdrive the president had already made  lies since taking office the truth is you dont make up  lies if the truth works for you and no the economy is not good much less great for every job created this administration has added  in taxpayer debt and this debt is not an investment in our future but just parked in a stock market bubble and bubbles always burst and no other than the bipartisan prison reform bill he is not doing jesus work he supports the right to life movement that intentionally creates four out of five abortions in america by banning sex education in schools blocking accessibleaffordable birth control and shutting down planned parenthoods there is nothing new testament about that but yes as the bipartisan senate intelligence committee stated in october russia interfered in the  election to promote his victory and undermine the clinton campaign and as the mueller report showed there was indeed multiple communications between the presidents campaign and russia and the intentional use of russianleaked stolen files and yes yes the mueller report also laid out ten clearcut impeachable examples of the presidents obstruction of justice on just the topic of his campaigns coordination with russia none of this reality made it through the foxrussiarightwing media bubble for his true believers their first step into his postimpeachment reality is indeed a doozy but its a step that for the sake of our nation needs taking the truth is this week has been a huge win for the spirit of peace on earth and goodwill towards humankind that fuels this holiday season to celebrate this weekend at penzeys along with our already scheduled holiday offers we are highlighting americas greatest success yet against this rising tide of nationalism and injustice that has come with the successful impeachment vote in congress by giving away a free v for victory pin with any purchase if youve yet to hold one of our v for victory pins in your hands they are modeled upon the victory pins of americas last great struggle against nationalism during wwii the pins are both small and powerful and are a constant reminder of all that is at stake in this defense of american values against the corruption and cruelty that have overtaken the republican party in this time of unlimited political spending and yes yes yes celebrate i have immense respect for the leadership in congress who managed so successfully to navigate impeachment to its historic victory in the house of representatives i also fully understand for those who cast their vote wednesday the seriousness with which they took their obligation that was neither the time nor the place for happy dances but for the rest of us right through the new year this is very much a time for us to celebrate that this holiday season the forces of kindness and compassion have proven themselves to be still very much alive and well in our nation america isnt great because of any one type of person that lives here america is great because of its rules of law that defend the rights of every human no matter where they may have come from whenever those laws prevail as they did this wednesday it is a time for all who believe in america to celebrate the goodness at the heart of our country our v for victory pin is a powerful little reminder of all that is at stake right now in our country come get yours this weekend while we have such a good and just victory to celebrate no coupon needed please share this and let your family and friends know and when the holidays come and you see those angered by the reality impeachment has brought to their world please be kind and be patient they are going through a very tough transition but as much as kindness matters here kindness is not rolling over to help them grasp the reality that there are no facts that make their support of the president and the republican party just or reasonable my experience is that there is success to be found in those  lies he has told since taking office if the facts worked for him why would he have needed to create a lie for literally every waking hour since he entered the white house please visit us at penzeyscom thanks for making us part of your kitchen and a most sincere happy holidays to you and all those in your life bill billpenzeyscom and to those of you feeling a bit annoyed about not finding

"is sex work work or exploitation sex work or sexual exploitation
changhua county is planning to establish a legal red light district which has caused divisions in public opinion proponents argue that since the sex work industry already exists it is best to provide sex workers with a safe environment under the supervision of competent authorities they also mentioned the lack of job opportunities in changhua in southern taiwan and that sex work can provide women with no other means of earning a living wage sex trade zone some people claim that only  of sex workers in taiwan are from human trafficking and it is rare to enter sex work through human trafficking so most sex workers choose to join the sex work industry
the source of this statistic is unknown but from lixin is past experience this is just the tip of the iceberg there are thousands of forms of exploitation they are often hidden beneath the surface or in gray areas on the fringes of the law the us state department is trafficking in persons report section for taiwan states that  of the aliens accused of illegal immigration last year were identified as victims of human trafficking  of them were victims of sex trafficking
lixin has over  years of experience protecting sex workers providing sheltered placements other direct services and advocating for sex workers rights we stand with sex workers and are committed to their dignity and safety however we believe that sexual activity should not be classified as work no woman will choose to engage unless sexually abducted enticed coerced framed extorted financially difficult or otherwise circumstantial sex work for example some women are lured into paying off their debts through prostitution simply because they have taken out loan sharks and failed to pay the expensive interest on time
lixin disagrees that legal sex work and governmentregulated brothels will protect women experiences in germany and other countries where prostitution is legal show that the number of illegal prostitution cases or trafficking of women increases in both the regulated red light districts and other areas outside the regulated areas lixin also doesnt think there are other opportunities to earn a living in the changhua area we call on the government to dedicate resources to provide equal job opportunities for women
we know that because men who are willing to pay for prostitutes have a sexual need there is a supply of the sex work industry some of them have disabilities orphans or other reasons however this is still not the right thing to do we have to look at this issue from a gender standpoint in the context of patriarchy the exploitation of women the commodification of women and other factors
this is a difficult and complex social issue and there are strong arguments for both sides lixin looks forward to more indepth and constructive discussions in the future to help taiwanese society reach a consensus and gain a deeper understanding of this issue
see moregender issuessex work is not work but exploitation
sex work is not work sex work is exploitation penalty for whoring but not prostitution
investment in employment resources for disadvantaged women
changhua county is plan to set up a red light district has split opinion proponents of the proposal argue that sex work exists so it is better that sex workers are given a safe environment where there is supervision and oversight by the authorities they also say changhua in south taiwan lacks economic opportunities so sex work gives women who have no other way of supporting themselves a valuable income
some argue that since few sex workers are trafficked the majority do it by choice others say there is a need for a sex zone among men who are unmarried widowed disabled or husbands of wives who are ill
among feminist groups in taiwan there are differences of opinion on whether to legalize abolish decriminalize or prohibit prostitution
at the garden of hope firstly we stand by the women sex workers and defend their dignity and safety we have been at the forefront of protecting sex workers for over  years providing shelter and other direct services and advocating for their rights
however we do not think that sex should be classified as work it is not a career path that any young woman would consider taking unless she was forced by grooming enticement coercion entrapment extortion economic hardship or other environmental factors
even though only a small minority are physically forced we do not agree that any woman goes into prostitution by choice
for example we know of cases of women who have borrowed money from loan sharks found themselves falling behind on the high interest rates and have then been enticed into prostitution as a way to get themselves out of debt
supporters of changhua is red light district claim only  of sex workers are trafficked in taiwan we dont know where this figure comes from but in our experience this would only be the tip of the iceberg exploitation takes many different forms and is often hidden under the surface or in a grey area on the margins of the law
the us state department is trafficking in person is tip report on taiwan says last year  trafficking victims were identified among foreigners accused of immigration violations including  sex trafficking victims
we doubt that legalizing sex work and regulating brothels will protect women the experience of germany and other countries that have legalized prostitution has been an increase in illegal prostitution outside the regulated red light districts and more trafficking of women
we also do not accept there are no other viable job opportunities in changhua we urge the government to invest in employment to give women equal work we understand that supply is created by demand for sex from men who are willing to pay for it some of whom may be disabled widowed or have other good reasons however that doesnt make it right
we need to look at this issue from a gendered perspective and in the context of the patriarchy exploitation of women commodification of women is bodies and other factors
this is a difficult and complex issue with strong arguments on both sides we would like to see more informed and constructive dialogue on this question to help build consensus and understanding in taiwanese society

to those still supporting the president someone posted this on our page and i believe it is worth sharing with you how incredibly biased your company is i hope your conservative customers take a hard look at what you are really selling you certainly do not want america to be great again i am a proud republican conservative and think our great president is making america great again first off let me say thanks for writing to you and every other writer of the    comments ive read along these lines in the last two years and yes we are biased biased in favor of the kindness at the heart of cooking through cooking we learn that when we take time to share kindness and care for those around us the world becomes a better place there was a time when this kindness was at home in both political parties for now at least those days are past reading all these emails has been an education at this point my response is if you werent hurting anyone you could believe whatever you wish and for the most part no one would say anything but you are hurting people by what your support is keeping in power your support of racism environmental devastation and the devaluation of our standing in the world is causing real harm not only to all of us right now but to future generations as well i understand how the realities our country is facing has been kept from you and that your thoughts are no longer entirely your own doesnt it seem odd to you how your mind can sincerely believe celebrities and business people should stay out of politics while at the very same time being equally sincerely excited about your celebrity businessman president and i have no doubt that you love this country but doesnt it somewhere deep down bother you that we are turning our allies against us while empowering and enriching those who would do us harm somewhere along the way you gave up something inside you of who you are something so fundamental to the functioning of democracy where once you would have held deep distrust for any candidate keeping their tax returns hidden you came to see the hiding of the truth as admirable where once you saw loyalty as key to character now it sure seems you are totally fine with third spouses playboy models and adult industry workers for all ive known and enjoyed conservatives all my life and i have to be honest with you and say this just does not sound like you please wake up your country needs you the good news is that a whole lot of people who were supporting all of this just a short while ago are now waking up and rejecting the personality cult the republican party has become and are instead finding their own path weve also seen posted recently i didnt choose to leave the republican party the republican party chose to leave me i and the rest of my family were born and bred republicans donated  canvased for votes both doortodoor and by phone worked the polls and this current republican party in no way resembles the party we supported i really cant view it as republican i am a lifelong republican and have never been more embarrassed to say so i am working diligently in my state of nh to get democrats elected dont let the label you have slapped on yourself not reflect the truth of what you believe i grew up in a republican family and heck even my mom isnt republican anymore the even better news is if you choose to make the change from everything weve seen a whole lot of people will be reallyreally happy that you did and they will welcome you with wide open arms as much as the president himself is pushing the false notion that those who oppose him are driven by hate and anger this simply isnt true hate doesnt drive people to work for transgender rights racial equality or the welcoming of asylum seekers just the opposite really for anyone who has come around to realizing supporting the president and those enabling him was a mistake but are now worried about how they will be treated if they come out and make the change please dont be really kind people are going to be very happy for you right now its not about where you have been so much as about where youve arrived and nows a good time to arrive at a good place i think you will find the food tasty here too not a lot of lonely desktop taco salads and buckets of deepfried fast food a big part of the fun in celebrating all the cultures that actually make america great is the cooks you meet and the foods they share dig in the election is now right around the corner as much as we believe every night is a good night to cook and theres nothing better to do with your time than cooking were good with reheating something tuesday  to give you time to get out to vote with that in mind and understanding some foods are even more tasty after a day or even

eight years ago our states humanity came under attack vote tuesday  to restore wisconsin to a place where elected leaders have the strength to protect our schools environment and kindness no matter how big of a campaign donation offered to promote sharing until sunday  worth of good spices amp kindness just  all of us who grew up in the state of wisconsin grew up in a place we could be proud of a strong economy based on quality public education a  university system that rivaled the nations best a pro environmental voice heard around the country and around the world and behind all this was the intentional kindness and caring of our states people the wisconsin of our youth was a gift given to us by all those who came before that we were obliged to pass on to all those who came after then came the  election the republican party chose wisconsin to be the test ground for all that unlimited political spending could do the very same forces that paved the way for what happened nationally in  first tested it all out here before the president grabbed the reins it was our governor testing out the attack on education selling out the environment and even testing the staged racism towards native americans we must address what is happening in the white house but just removing the tip of the iceberg changes pretty much nothing for real change we must also address the source and thats up to us the wisconsin voters penzeys is a wisconsin business and a national business too as a yearold just starting penzeys i thought it would have been easier if my grandparents had chosen a city a little more in the spotlight today im convinced if we had been planted anywhere else finding our way to the business weve become would have only been harder human kindness really is universal but growing up in my parents spice store on rd amp galena through our customers i was given the chance to witness a kindness that was also intentional through them i learned when you take the time to care about others the world becomes a better place thats a very milwaukee and very wisconsin idea the fact is wisconsin wasnt randomly chosen out of a hat as the test ground for what unlimited political spending could do we were chosen because of our history wisconsin created the republican party as a force against slavery milwaukee has long embraced compassionate capitalism if unlimited media buys and the anger of the right wing echo machine could unravel a century of wisconsin support for education and the environment here it could be repeated everywhere so they set off to vilify teachers and turn suburban voters against public education for a  property tax cut then they went after our states proud history of environmental protection for nothing more than their own campaign contributions at first our desire to see goodness in everyone had us thinking this was just a brandnew governor in over his head but as time went on and this all only escalated we saw how incredibly organized the money behind all this was in time we came to realize there was no goodness here at all only the stripmining of the public good to give more to those who were already the wealthiest of the wealthy there was the thought in  that our now president with his lack of conscience and willingness to sell out all that is good for his own advancement somehow surprised the republican party we here in wisconsin have learned the hard way these are the very leadership values theyve built their new party model around january   the day after the inauguration the day of the first womans march many nationally were pleasantly surprised that a wisconsin spice business had a symbol that so closely embraced the feelings that had them marching in our kind heart pin and in the words kindness cant sit down simply because anger has stood up testing grounds work both ways while wisconsin was the trial run for what the republicans have now become nationally we were pushing back against their efforts time and again we found when they go after education minority rights the environment healthcare for those in need or even now in their taking of children from parents legally seeking asylum what they are really trying to do is erode our common decency and our shared humanity for them to win they need us to stop caring in studying their blueprints what weve found is that their death star has no defense against human compassion our kindness is our strength please use this knowledge any way you can this tuesday in wisconsin its this message of kindness we must share and continue to share across the nation through november  and onward to november   in wisconsin it is time for someone with the strength and courage to stand up to outside money no matter the size of the check to be voted the opportunity to govern thankfully there are many with this strength and courage on tuesdays ballot if you are in wisconsin and would like to know more about how and where to vote please click this link,1

an important message for my fellow illinoisans good evening illinois its a shame that abc  chicago decided to exclude  of the candidates running for governor after working diligently for the last two weeks to convince abc to allow all four candidates on the debate stage i have nothing left to say to them but i do have something to say to you the people of illinois it is obvious that a vote for pritzker is a vote to make madigan the de facto governor of our great state it is also equally obvious that a vote for rauner is a vote to allow madigan to continue to be the de facto governor of our state we all know that a pritzker governorship would put the chicago democratic machine in total control of illinois state government which would be the death of our great state as we know it we also know that rauner is a failure and would bring four more years of the same failure to the governors office we simply cannot afford four more years of any elected official that allowed veterans to become sick and even die while deliberately suppressing details of a deadly epidemic at the quincy veterans home for selfdealing political gain the illinois attorney general has appropriately launched an investigation into criminal wrongdoing on the part of rauner and his administration i call on the attorney general to request that the us department of justice and the fbi take the lead on this investigation the last thing we need is a progressive chicago billionaire who as the inspector general of cook county just reported allegedly orchestrated and engaged in a scheme to fraudulently reduce his own property tax burden while the rest of us struggle to keep our heads above water with the everrising onslaught of higher and higher property taxes year after year unlike pritzker i will work to remove madigan from his recordbreaking term as speaker where he keeps a stranglehold on the people of illinois unlike rauner i wont have to ask madigan permission to be in charge as he infamously confessed in chicago on december th  it should go without saying that the governorship of a major state does not come with on the job training  you have to be ready to lead from day one i am the only candidate running for governor that is prepared in every way to lead our state into a stronger and more prosperous tomorrow but i cant do it alone this is where you the people come in you not the media not the parties and definitely not madigan are in control of this election i implore you to be brave enough to vote for the illinois that you want not the illinois that the dueling parties the lobbyists the billionaires and the backroom dealers have convinced us for far too long is the best that we can do we can do better and we will do better i am asking for your vote to be your next governor of illinois lets rebuild illinois together senator sam mccann  october rd,1

remember pull aside stay alive
if you encounter a dust storm and cannot avoid driving into it
pull off the road as far as you can safely do so
turn off your headlights and taillights
put your vehicle in park andor engage your parking brake and take your foot off the brake so your brake lights are not illuminated other motorists may tend to follow tail lights in an attempt to get through the dust storm and may strike your vehicle from behind
