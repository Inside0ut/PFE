Paramedics and emergency medical technicians MUST RESPOND to every single call for help. They must triage the injured, stop the bleeding from fatal wounds, restart hearts that have ceased to beat, evacuate critical Covid patients, and so much more.
This work cannot stop, nor can it slow. And to do it they need an overflowing stream of medical supplies and equipment. In Israel these things are provided almost exclusively by the generous donations of others, largely from FRIENDS in America.
When you make a donation of ANY AMOUNT to help provide the urgent professional medical supplies that Israelis cannot live without, we will send you one of our ISRAEL FIRST-AID KITS as a token of our appreciation.
This kit contains a variety of household first-aid supplies such as multiple types of personal bandages, gauze, tape, tweezers, alcohol prep pads, scissors, safety gloves, cotton swabs, and more.
When you give to help Israel’s emergency response teams save the most critically wounded and desperate patients, we want to give you this kit to help in the small emergencies of your life.
