q what can be done to slow the revolving administrative turnover a turnover in the district will always be a concern because there are many opportunities for administrators and bigger districts simply can afford to pay more than we can this propensity toward turnover makes stability in board leadership even more important to understand the vision of the strategic plan as well as our responsibility toward our constituency and our respect for our history fortunately w  e have implemented a strong new strategic plan that alone will help guide our districts leaders in times of leadership change in addition to competitive contracts which our administrators enjoy for a district our size we must make lsh schools a place where people can find job satisfaction we have many strengths not the least of which is our smalltown atmosphere and the opportunity to get much experience through wearing many hats as an administrator we will attract people who are emerging leaders who have accepted their first administrative position one thing that is important for us to do is to utilize dr johnsons strengths in formalizing internal procedures in  the district had few formalized internal procedures which can overwhelm a new emerging leader administrator unfortunately complacency with longstanding administrators moved us to face the challenges of rebuilding our internal processes the board in the past  years has reviewed all the districts policies and is adhering to an annual schedule of review some policies had become quite dated with an everchanging learning environment evolving policies and procedures are critical to the success of our future leaders we must strive to make sure that our policies and procedures fit the needs of our district this means applying critical thinking and keeping on top of the needs of our learners and educators all that having been said it is far more important to have the right individuals in place than to have longstanding noncollaborative and ineffective administrators we are definitely headed in the right direction with our current leadership teams through these teams our goal of achieving a culture of excellence and success has a strong foundation  votefaches  giantvision  smalltownsgiantopportunities,1

what does it take to defeat don blankenship in a west virginia republican primary race for us senate it requires the mitch mcconnellcontrolled republican senatorial committee to spend nearly  million running negative false ads against him it requires every major national television networkand even president trumps sonto slanderously label him a felon it requires five republican us senators to endorse an opponent even with all that it still requires presiden  t trump himself to urge west virginians not to vote for don these media clippings which show the national media falsely labeling don a felon will likely be brushed off by some as just politics in fact they may even be totally ignored by the media but the story these clippings tell is a frightening one sure they show that the media and politicians lied in order to advance their establishment idealsno surprise there yes calling don a felon is a blatant lie doing so in the days leading up to the most watched race in the nation however is corruption in its truest form the washington establishment and the media have shown what they are capable of doing to protect themselves they will collude to spread any lie necessary to protect and maintain a government and an establishment that benefits the elitists and punishes average americans notwithstanding the fact that their actions will inevitably bankrupt america this is the same reason don was sent to a prison housing only felons as a mere misdemeanant this is the same reason that don was charged with felony crimes which the department of justice doj knew he did not commit this is the same reason that the truth about the upper big branch ubb mine has been hidden for eight years and why the government destroyed ubb documents and refuses to release doj internal reports related to the corrupt prosecution of don it does not take columbo or scotland yard to figure out what is going on here patrick morrisey is just another corrupt politician he settles west virginia lawsuits for pennies on the dollarlawsuits worth millions of dollars that were filed against opiate distributing drug companies before he even came to west virginiayet he parades around as the champion of the demise of the opiate industry meanwhile the opiate industry praises him hires his family to lobby on their behalf and provides the income his family depends on these companies were so happy to cheer on his arrival in west virginia they even paid for his inaugural party i dont believe there is a single candidate who ran for the west virginia republican party senate nomination who will vote for patrick morrisey why we got to know him well and we know we owe it to our fellow west virginians to do better than morrisey,0

homeschooling as some teachers parents and guardians believe can be an appropriate option for the student especially now in the midst of a health crisis all educational opportunities are being challenged due to covid covid is forcing educators across our country and especially in oregon to think outside the educational box and develop creative delivery models and methods
to meet the special needs of our all our students we must be willing to put aside differences and adjust to challenges such as the lack of rural broadband availability limited technology in homes and limited student interactions with classroom teachers and classmates the new normal may look much different than previous delivery models as we work to keep students and teachers in a safe learning environment we must work closely together to provide a quality education that is in the best interests of the student with whatever model is appropriate students first always",1

advertorial published today in the edmonton journal   those who advocate for lucy have repeatedly called for an impartial evaluation by species experts of her ability to be transported to sanctuary as long as qualified impartial veterinarians are never invited to examine her we will never know the truth the zoo claims it considered a long list of experts and fresh eyes to examine her instead they brought back the same  zoocircus vets they have used in th  e past and a calgary equine vet who has no experience with elephants these are hardly the qualified impartial assessments they promised advocates and the citizens of edmonton the edmonton valley zoo is primary consultant james oosterhuis opinion on lucy has never wavered as indeed it never has when the issue before him is moving a zoo elephant to sanctuary he also believed for similar reasons that a sick elephant in an alaska zoo should not be moved and yet that elephant was successfully relocated to sanctuary  years ago and she is still alive and thriving it is a fact that zoo veterinarians rarely if ever consider retirement to sanctuary because it does not serve the interests of zoos to have these popular megafauna retired from display mr galloway says we cannot send her to her death and yet lucys life has been a kind of death the small enclosure with no enhancements her isolation a cold climate and daily keeper reports spanning four decades make clear that the care she receives is just good enough to keep her functioning as a zoo exhibitthe latest medial assessment of her health status is just another shameful chapter among many in lucys life as a captive zoo elephant if the valley zoo is confident with their hired zoo vet is assertions they should be open to allowing world renowned experts to confirm their claims leap has offered to cover the costs of such an exam yet they steadfastly refuse to allow these experts in why what could it harm if species experts confirm moving lucy is not in her best interests this battle could finally be over we would then switch our focus to helping her living conditions here the one thing we cannot change no matter what improvements are done is edmonton is climate and lucy is solitary confinement these are the  biggest issues affecting lucy is quality of life,1
