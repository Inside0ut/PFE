why oklahoma should vote no on sq  on november  i have been seeing so much somewhat misleading and deceptive attractive advertising trying to get those viewing the ads to vote yes on sq it appears that they are relying on the fact that most voters do not actually read the words of a state question until they actually see their ballot when voting and will decide based on just what they had heard advertised as opposed to understanding the real meaning of what they  are voting on almost everyone would like more free choices and affordability on anything which is what these ads focus on however that is not really what sq is about below is the actual wording of sq as it will appear on the ballot the key important words toward which everyone should focus are presented below in capital letters after the sq text below i am presenting some comments about the wording and it is actual meaning for everyone to consider state question  reads this measure adds a new section  to article  of the oklahoma constitution under the new section no law shall infringe on optometrists or opticians ability to practice within a retail mercantile establishment discriminate against optometrists or opticians based on the location of their practice or require external entrances for optometric offices within retail mercantile establishments no law shall infringe on retail mercantile establishments ability to sell prescription optical goods or services the section allows the legislature to restrict optometrists from performing surgeries within retail mercantile establishments limit the number of locations at which an optometrist may practice maintain optometric licensing requirements require optometric offices to be in a separate room of a retail mercantile establishment and impose health and safety standards it does not prohibit optometrists and opticians from agreeing with retail mercantile establishments to limit their practice laws conflicting with this section are void the section defines laws optometrist optician optical goods and services and retail mercantile establishment shall the proposal be approved   for the proposal  yes   against the proposal  no comments  the only reason that sq was written in this way and will be on the ballot is because of an initiative petition on which walmart was able to get enough signatures from their many customers in their many stores throughout oklahoma by just telling them that signing it would get past the politics of eyecare and make eye exams and eyeglasses cheaper most people likely signed with just that information without really knowing and understanding the real impact of sq by the way walmart is behind the vote yes ads even though they usually do not say so in the ads  this would be changing the oklahoma constitution rather that making or altering legislated law so that it can not be ever changed or amended by the oklahoma legislature in the future without another statewide vote things in the constitution trump all laws or rules by oklahoma is legislature or any heath profession boards that monitor standards of practice and care of provided by state doctors to protect the public from unethical and potentially harmful modes of practice  oklahoma is the first state where walmart is attempting to totally bypass going through the elected state legislature to change or negate our laws that do not fit into their business model or positively affect their ability to profit off the healthcare sector of the economy   notice how it states that no law shall infringe on the ability of an optometrist or optician to practice in a retail establishment or infringe on a retail establishment is ability to sell prescription optical goods and services in other words all of the current state public protection laws that require minimum levels of competency examination accuracy of prescription eyewear etc would be voided and not applicable to optometrists opticians or optical goods provided within a retail mercantile establishment such as walmart the laws would all still be applicable to every other professional optometrist optician and all optical goods outside of retail mercantile stores it sure appears that this is an attempt to protect the retail mercantile establishments from having to worry about maintaining a certain level of expertise and quality of care to avoid potential litigation  since this is a vote to change the oklahoma constitution the state legislature would no longer have the constitutional authority to vote on change pass and enforce future laws or rules that would apply to the quality or scope of vision eyecare or optical good quality provided by any retail mercantile establishment in oklahoma other than in the specific areas stated above in sq that it allows the legislature to do  it does not prohibit optometrists from agreeing with the retail establishment to limit their scope of practice there are certain minimum procedures in current oklahoma law that are required to be a part of every eye examination that often detect many other serious health problems including but not limited to glaucoma macular degeneration cancer diabetes tumors etc with this wording those laws would not apply to the optometrists in the retail mercantile stores such as walmart  laws conflicting with this section are void pretty much covers it all to protect walmart and other retail establishments from having adhere to any of the laws that were passed after much debate within the oklahoma legislature over the last century those laws and regulations have served oklahomans very well as we are currently at the top of the list of states in the country when looking at the quality of vision care eye health care and optical goods provided that will rapidly change if sq passes please think about it all and hopefully you will decide to vote no on sq on november  personal note thank you for reading all of this as many of you know this is my th year of practice  so i am very well established and the outcome of this vote will really not personally have a significant economic affect on my practice at this point in my life my deep concern and time doing this is from the heart for my love of oklahoma and my chosen profession my sincere concern is for the very dedicated young professional doctors and future oklahomans that the high standards of care we have seen in the past will continue to be provided and available to all future oklahomans for many years to come donald j farris od please share this information with to your friends family and coworkers  thank you,1

"patacas and synthetics
the first days of deflation have revealed a lot of dynamics on the part of the municipal executive of pacos de ferreira visits have already been made to several parishes circumstantial works were presented on public roads and measures to support recreational and sports associations were announced suddenly and after many appeals for fellow citizens not to leave their homes and companies to stay behind closed doors to protect themselves from the spread of covid the executive reacts as if we are not leaving a national state of emergency and even finds a magic formula to invest in various infrastructures which is healthy
all this frenzy comes after the leader of the municipality assumed that the chamber did not have funds for investment and that it even led to requesting the postponement of payment to the fam to focus only on supporting fellow citizens in difficulties because of the pandemic well this suspension was accepted and the money was made available to help citizens in difficulty which when it happens is always worth highlighting but what is not understood is how from a status of a bankrupt council funds are suddenly arranged to for example invest in the construction of four synthetic turfs in clubs in the county i have always defended that sports infrastructures must be properly equipped for the development of sport in our community which is sorely lacking but it is also important to understand how and when it is done and we cannot forget that at this moment the priorities must be different namely in full support for the dynamism of the local economy and real support for families
but beyond that we cannot forget that the history of synthetic turf has explicit rules so that clubs can be awarded this work all the study work technical and financial was well structured by the former sports councilor a deep knowledge of the sporting and recreational reality of the county through concerted measures with the clubs he managed to foresee the construction of a synthetic in each year of this term but financial difficulties have postponed this objective until now almost as a miracle we see the mayor announcing an investment of  seven hundred thousand euros fully supported by the municipality which is healthy it should be remembered that the municipal budget line for synthetic fields was opened in  but due to lack of funds this investment was postponed with only the construction of a synthetic for this year  two for  and another two for  counting five synthetics leaving penamaior behind

so much false information why do we believe the crap let us research for ourselves myth delegates could make changes to the constitution that new yorkers dont want fact delegates can only propose changes to the constitution new york state voters have the final say and must approve any amendment proposed by the convention myth supporters of a yes vote hid the convention referendum on the back of the ballot so that fewer people would see it fact convention supporter evan davis representing the yes coalition sued the new york state board of elections to force the referendum to be printed on the front of the ballot the yes coalition publicly called on the no group to join this effort and received no response ultimately the lawsuit was withdrawn after the board of elections agreed to instruct voters in a prominent placement on the front of the ballot to turn it over and make sure to weigh in on the question myth if you leave the referendum question blank it will be counted as an automatic yes vote fact this is a ludicrous lie that has been spread on social media if you dont vote on the convention question it wont register either way myth big money special interests and shadowy billionaires with a hidden agenda are pushing for a yes vote fact actually the opposite is true the yes coalition which is comprised primarily of good government groups and reformminded organizations is waging a david versus goliath battle against the no side which includes virtually all of the major special interest groups in albany the no side is dramatically outspending the yes coalition perhaps by as much as a  margin come election day politico reported that last year the no side contributed  times more money to statelevel candidates than the yes coalition in addition the no side spent  million lobbying in new york state while the yes coalition spent a mere,1

yesterday news broke that new york republican representative chris collins had been charged with securities fraud wire fraud and making false statements from what is allegedly an insidertrading scheme centered around a pharmaceutical company from australia federal prosecutors believe rep collins who sat on the companys board of directors used nonpublic information about the companys drug trial results to tip off his family members but in the end collins ended up  losing about  million of his own money his son however after being tipped off about the nonpublic information sold his shares and purportedly avoided more than half a million dollars in losses its a farreaching story and an important topic and suffice it to say its not the first time we in oklahoma have heard of this australian pharmaceutical company in april  the oklahoman reported on our very own congressman markwayne mullin who sat on a subcommittee with influence over the fda having a possible conflict of interest with his big investment in this very same company that story broke more than a year ago as a result of news that rep collins had purchased stock in the company pushed for the passage of a bill that would benefit the company then bought even more stock in the company of course mr mullin through a spokesperson denied the existence of a conflict when the news broke that he had invested according to the oklahoman not even two months before mr mullin invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in this company he voted for a bill that purportedly required the fda to give lower standards of evidence when considering whether or not to approve a new drug rep collins put together that provision i realize the importance of running my campaign not simply against the horrible things markwayne mullin has done to our district and for his own benefit ive tried to run this campaign for eastern oklahomans because ive always said i want you to know what i stand for and not just what i stand against but now is not the time to turn our heads or to shy away from speaking up and against these actions i choose to run against the corruption and indifference that plagues many of our incumbents including markwayne replacing markwayne mullin will take an oklahoman who has lived here through mr mullins tenure  one who understands whats at stake for our district and our country if we let him continue to parade around at the expense of special interests while evading his own constituents for years ive seen him silence people who offer a differing opinion ive heard him tell fellow oklahomans they just dont understand how government works ive listened as he forcefully told voters that he doesnt work for them enough our district has suffered from his policies for far too long i understand the importance of replacing mr mullin because ive lived through the past six years he needs to go and were going to make sure that happens please join me in this effort by voting for me jason nichols in the democratic primary runoff election on august th and again on november th,1
i didnt wear seat belts growing up and i lived but that doesnt make it a solid parenting practice respectfully its time for us to grow out of the limiting belief that spanking is acceptable because i was spanked and i turned out fine perhaps you did  though not because you were spanked but in spite of its true that not every child who was spanked will turn out badly its also true that some children who were never spanked will not turn out fine but anecdotal evidence aside scientific research clearly shows the likelihood of negative outcomes increases when youve been spanked as a child we cant always see these outcomes in the moment just as we cant see our children growing taller on a daily basis to claim spanking a child is fine because we turned out fine often means we are falling victim to three pitfalls in our thinking that come along with anecdotal evidence namely dismissing all broader data to the contrary dismissing alternate views and failing to learn and progress by engaging with a challenging idea if you are pro spanking i ask that before you reply you sit with the data and the reality that pediatricians and psychologists around the world are clear  spanking is harmful says kazdin who served as apa president in  there is no need for corporal punishment based on the research we are not giving up an effective technique we are saying this is a horrible thing that does not work grow past spanking it can be challenging when it was the only form of discipline modeled for us but with tools and support it is possible for more on the science behind this share,1

"are vaccines the only path back to a normal life with the covid vaccine likely being the most rushed and most widely mandated this video is important and timely
is it true that vaccine studies dont ever get control groups and randomization read dr fauci is answer below
dr fauci fed response and gov newsom ca gov state that things will only return to normal when a vaccine is widely available and taken by  of the uninfected population dr faucci specifically states that he hopes we dont get natural herd immunity because that would require so many people to get infected
this episode  video below promotes doing good studies for vaccine safety is it wrong to just allow for continued dialogue and research
q some antivaccine groups say the only trial they will accept is a randomized control study that compares vaccinated children with unvaccinated ones what are the issues with a study like that
answer by dr fauci methodologically that is very difficult if not impossible to do because there are real ethical concerns about withholding a potentially lifesaving intervention from a group of people where it would be a large enough group to have a statistically significant conclusion of unvaccinated cohort and vaccinated cohort it is logistically difficult and ethically quite questionable
it is peculiar that one can conclude that any medical procedure is so safe that risks are almost unmeasureable and so effective that it is unethical to withhold when it has never been compared to a control group

people have asked me what i will do as supervisor being a republican on a board that has four democrats to which i answer in local elections party does not matter because we are trying to find people that can make sure things get done things like paving our streets plowing our snow keeping our streams clean ensuring the public safety and making decisions that do not make our lives more difficult i see my job as a newly elected supervisor as a thirdparty watchdog i k  now i will need to compromise to achieve what is best for our community i understand that i will not always agree with the direction the majority will take us but i will make sure that we do not waste taxpayer dollars or exacerbate the problems we face i will focus on moving things forward that only municipal government can do such as maintaining what we own including buildings streets storm and sanitary sewers and our parks a prime example of what i will focus on at my first meeting is the community center roof for unexplained reasons and after going over budget and beyond deadlines this board has not addressed the leaking roof on the building it has been four years and since the start of renovations and we have not fixed this problem it has caused damage to the facility and is a significant liability my opponent was on the citizen board that oversees the community center before being appointed supervisor she now is the supervisor liaison to the advisory board she has known about the problems but has not been able to get the roof project completed recently they paid over  and relied on an architect to come up with a plan to redesign the roof the idea was put out to bid and came back at a whopping  million for the repairs knowledgeable residents with roofing experience sounded the alarms that this was too much money and unnecessary instead of getting a second opinion from a commercial roofing company on the plan and cost ms garzillo requested a second opinion from the township public works director now ms garzillo and the board have decided to piece the roof project out and bid each piece separately by doing this the public will not be able to track the price tag easily and it will ultimately result in a more costly roof because of the loss of economies of scale unfortunately this is not the only project in the township that this is occurring but it is indicative of what complacency and a lack of oversight bring to local government,1

to all of the women in my life i say i am sorry i am sorry for playing into a system that marginalizes women i have unfairly played a role in creating this monster it is ingrained in our ethos as a society i say that i am disgusted at a travesty committed by a governing body that not only failed but sent a crystal clear message to children both male and female that this behavior is okay when you are young and when you are old i say that i am enraged at the inequality  that is still alive and well in this country that hammers home the message that women are not powerful intelligent capable and strong enough to be as credible as men i say that i am proud i am proud of dr ford i am grateful for strong female role models who stand up when the unspoken rules of society tell them to have a seat i am in awe of the strong women in my life who ive been fortunate enough to have been steered in the right direction by i say that you are powerful you are strong you are capable and that because of this our society is being forced from its complacency with the knowledge that true change happens only by making the hard decisions by shouting singularly through the winds of a storm that would not have you speak at all i say now that you are not singular i hear your voices my son hears your voices i make sure that he hears you that he believes you that he respects you i say now that change is coming to the old guard it will not go down without a fight thank you to all of you strong women for empowering me and by proxy l all of the men and boys i communicate with to be an advocate to be an ear to have the courage to stand up and speak up along side you as long as you are present powerful loving passionate and strong i have hope for tomorrow i will not say that i am surprised i will say that you give me hope and i love you for that,1
please read the extremely important information about covid forwarded to me by a patient very good and reliable information subject fw deep insight on covid from ucsf is top infectious disease researchers this is worth readingsent by a colleague at um subject deep insight on covid from ucsf is top infectious disease researchers with brooks help i was able to arrange a discussion yesterday with uscfs top researchers in infectious disease here are the notes i bolded some of the more notable comments from the researchers uc san francisco is either the  or  hospital in california depending on which survey you read it is the th largest medical research center in the us based on research grants university of california san francisco biohub panel on covid march    panelists o joe derisi ucsfs top infectious disease researcher copresident of chanzuckerberg biohub a jv involving ucsf  berkeley  stanford coinventor of the chip used in sars epidemic o emily crawford covid task force director focused on diagnostics o cristina tato rapid response director immunologist o patrick ayescue leading outbreak response and surveillance epidemiologist o chaz langelier ucsf infectious disease doc whats below are essentially direct quotes from the panelists i bracketed the few things that are not quotes  top takeaways o at this point we are past containment containment is basically futile our containment efforts wont reduce the number who get infected in the us o now were just trying to slow the spread to help healthcare providers deal with the demand peak in other words the goal of containment is to flatten the curve to lower the peak of the surge of demand that will hit healthcare providers and to buy time in hopes a drug can be developed o how many in the community already have the virus no one knows o we are moving from containment to care o we in the us are currently where at where italy was a week ago we see nothing to say we will be substantially different o  of the us population will be infected over the next  months after that level you can start to get herd immunity unlike flu this is entirely novel to humans so there is no latent immunity in the global population o we used their numbers to work out a guesstimate of deaths indicating about  million americans may die the panelists did not disagree with our estimate this compares to seasonal flus average of k americans per year assume  of us population thats m people infected with  mortality rate that is m americans die over the next  months the fatality rate is in the range of x flu this assumes no drug is found effective and made available o the death rate varies hugely by age over age  the mortality rate could be  see chart by age signe found online attached at bottom o dont know whether covid is seasonal but if is and subsides over the summer it is likely to roar back in fall as the  flu did o i can only tell you two things definitively definitively its going to get worse before it gets better and we will be dealing with this for the next year at least our lives are going to look different for the next year  what should we do now what are you doing for your family o appears one can be infectious before being symptomatic we dont know how infectious before symptomatic but know that highest level of virus prevalence coincides with symptoms we currently think folks are infectious  days before through  days after onset of symptoms t to t onset o how long does the virus last on surfaces best guess is  hours depending on surface type maybe a few days but still no consensus on this the virus is very susceptible to common antibacterial cleaning agents bleach hydrogen peroxide alcoholbased o avoid concerts movies crowded places o we have cancelled business travel o do the basic hygiene eg hand washing and avoiding touching face o stockpile your critical prescription medications many pharma supply chains run through china pharma companies usually hold  months of raw materials so may run out given the disruption in chinas manufacturing o pneumonia shot might be helpful not preventative of covid but reduces your chance of being weakened which makes covid more dangerous o get a flu shot next fall not preventative of covid but reduces your chance of being weakened which makes covid more dangerous o we would say anyone over  stay at home unless its critical cdc toyed with idea of saying anyone over  not travel on commercial airlines o we at ucsf are moving our atrisk parents back from nursing homes etc to their own homes then are not letting them out of the house the other members of the family are washing hands the moment they come in o three routes of infection hand to mouth  face aerosol transmission fecal oral route  what if someone is sick o if someone gets sick have them stay home and socially isolate there is very little you can do at a hospital that you couldnt do at home most cases are mild but if they are old or have lung or cardiovascular problems read on o if someone gets quite sick who is old  or with lung or cardiovascular problems take them to the er o there is no accepted treatment for covid the hospital will give supportive care eg iv fluids oxygen to help you stay alive while your body fights the disease ie to prevent sepsis o if someone gets sick who is high risk eg is both old and has lungcardiovascular problems you can try to get them enrolled for compassionate use of remdesivir a drug that is in clinical trial at san francisco general and ucsf and in china need to find a doc there in order to ask to enroll remdesivir is an antiviral from gilead that showed effectiveness against mers in primates and is being tried against covid if the trials succeed it might be available for next winter as production scales up far faster for drugs than for vaccines more i found online o why is the fatality rate much higher for older adults your immune system declines past age  fatality rate tracks closely with comorbidity ie the presence of other conditions that compromise the patients hearth especially respiratory or cardiovascular illness these conditions are higher in older adults risk of pneumonia is higher in older adults  what about testing to know if someone has covid o bottom line there is not enough testing capacity to be broadly useful heres why o currently there is no way to determine what a person has other than a pcr test no other test can yet distinguish covid from flu or from the other dozen respiratory bugs that are circulating o a polymerase chain reaction pcr test can detect covids rna however they still dont have confidence in the tests specificity ie they dont know the rate of false negatives o the pcr test requires kits with reagents and requires clinical labs to process the kits o while the kits are becoming available the lab capacity is not growing o the leading clinical lab firms quest and labcore have capacity to process  kits per day for the nation o expanding processing capacity takes time space and equipment and certification ie it wont happen soon o ucsf and ucberkeley have donated their research labs to process kits but each has capacity to process only  kits per day and are not clinically certified o novel test methods are on the horizon but not here now and wont be at any scale to be useful for the present danger  how well is society preparing for the impact o local hospitals are adding capacity as we speak ucsfs parnassus campus has erected triage tents in a parking lot they have converted a ward to negative pressure which is needed to contain the virus they are considering reopening the shuttered mt zion facility o if covid affected children then we would be seeing mass departures of families from cities but thankfully now we know that kids are not affected o school closures are one the biggest societal impacts we need to be thoughtful before we close schools especially elementary schools because of the knockon effects if elementary kids are not in school then some hospital staff cant come to work which decreases hospital capacity at a time of surging demand for hospital services o public health systems are prepared to deal with shortterm outbreaks that last for weeks like an outbreak of meningitis they do not have the capacity to sustain for outbreaks that last for months other solutions will have to be found o what will we do to handle behavior changes that can last for months many employees will need to make accommodations for elderly parents and those with underlying conditions and immunesuppressed kids home due to school closures o dr derisi had to leave the meeting for a call with the governors office when he returned we asked what the call covered the epidemiological models the state is using to track and trigger action the state is planning at what point they will take certain actions ie what will trigger an order to cease any gatherings of over  people  where do you find reliable news o the john hopkins center for health security site which posts daily updates the site says you can sign up to receive a daily newsletter on covid by email i tried and the page times out due to high demand after three more tries i was successful in registering for the newsletter o the new york times is good on scientific accuracy  observations on china o unlike during sars chinas scientists are publishing openly and accurately on covid o while chinas early reports on incidence were clearly low that seems to trace to their data management systems being overwhelmed not to any bad intent o wuhan has  beds per thousand while us has  beds per thousand wuhan built  additional hospitals in  weeks even so most patients were sent to gymnasiums to sleep on cots o early on no one had info on covid so china reacted in a way unique modern history except in wartime  every few years there seems another sars ebola mers hn covid growing strains of antibiotic resistant bacteria are we in the twilight of a century of medicines great triumph over infectious disease o weve been in a back and forth battle against viruses for a million years o but it would sure help if every country would shut down their wet markets o as with many things the worst impact of covid will likely be in the countries with the least resources eg africa see article on wired magazine on sequencing of virus from cambodia top takeaways o at this point we are past containment containment is basically futile our containment efforts wont reduce the number who get infected in the us o now were just

"taipei lessons for the mediocre rulers of bucharest
in february this year when in taipei the capital of taiwan comparable to romania in terms of population  million inhabitants hundreds of measures had already been taken against the covid epidemic in bucharest the rulers were still playing the part of early elections the nominees of prime ministers were on the facade and president iohannis assured us that everything was under control that we were dealing with a simple cold it was not until march  that the masquerade for the renaming of the orban government ended and the president announced the entry into force of the march  state of emergency
the wuhanchina epidemic began in december  and on december   the cases were also reported to the who of which taiwan is not a part for two and a half months the romanian rulers who are now giving us lessons on how well they managed the health crisis ignored all public information on who or affected states all special services reports all warnings from epidemiologists and experts announcing the danger of proportions for romania
meanwhile in taipei the rulers immediately understood the danger from the beginning of january  they restricted all shipments to and from china quickly restored the entire stockpile of protective materials increased domestic production of masks from  million masks a day in january to almost  million in may all this without instituting any measure to block the economy schools restaurants shops all economic activity remained open and now in the postvirus period taiwan does not think that it will stand with the sword of damocles over its head when it is evaluated by rating agencies as is the case in romania
moreover the difference between the government professionals in taipei and the mediocre political tricksters at the head of the government in bucharest is that while ours like fir trees they still tell us how well they managed the health crisis not being able to thaw the economy faster and waiting until june  after  and a half months of total economic downturn in the state of emergency and alert to announce a kind of economic recovery plan taipei is already discussing concretely the economic recovery model the areas which will be supported by government policies including biotechnology renewable energy cyber security and the actions to be taken by the taiwanese government for sustainable economic growth
from bucharest to taipei is  km but the distance in the deeds of the rulers is unfortunately much greater and this is best seen in the numbers although only  km from china with nearly  million people working and living in china taiwan had only  cases of coronavirus infection in its midst of which only  were active and only  dead at the same time romania had registered almost  thousand cases and almost  thousand deaths
what bad luck on romania with such mediocre leaders

update legislative leadership just invoked the nuclear option with respect to the budget for the first time in modern history it appears our budget will be passed as a conference report instead of a regular bill why does this matter because a conference report gets to skip over the committee process and is not subject to any amendments that means that whenever we see the budget  and it is still being written behind closed doors  it is essentially final and we are hearing the budget vote will be as soon as next week so without having seen a single line of it it is basically done you only pull a move like this if you are so entrenched in power that you are ok with openly insulting every taxpayer in the state think of it like driving over your neighbor is mailbox while giving them a thumbs up you only do something like that if you have become totally detached from what people think of you if you are a fiscal hawk you should be especially concerned by the fact that this budget will spend  billion of your tax money without anyone being able to publicly question or amend a single letter of it ultimately this is about teachers republicans know that democrats are going to offer amendments to raise teacher pay and republicans do not want to be on record voting against that so they are going to torpedo the whole process to avoid publicly saying no to teachers add this to your list of reasons why voting this november is absolutely essential,1

seems that the va is on a rating reduction rampage recently i have been deluged with vets writing about the va reducing their ratings here are some actual comments im at  for ptsd and the va letter i got says they are reducing my rating to  they did this from reviewing my records the va doctor looked over my case asked me some questions about my back injury she never asked about my depression and the letter i got said i was better and my rating was being reduced to  i just got a  rating for my tbi because the doctor said he could not separate my tbi problems from my depression symptoms seriously wtf it seems that recently the va is on a rating reduction rampage why is this happening well it depends upon who you talk to here are some of the reasons  reducing a rating reduces the money flowing out of the government the vet gets less benefit money each month and the government saves money now calculate this action by  million vets see why the rating rampage is going on  there are incompetent clinicians doing reviews im sorry to say this but it is true i read many dbqs and reports and i am shocked at the mistakes and inaccurate diagnosis i come across i was giving an expert opinion in court and afterwards the judge asked me this question i come across so much inconsistency in some psychologist reports especially with the global assessment functioning score the psychologist will be telling me why the client cant work that they are suicidal and then they give them a gaf of  can you explain this to me i politely but with some sarcasm replied i have no idea why that happens because i dont make those mistakes he laughed the gaf score is not suppose to be used anymore but the va frequently requests it and you will see it in reports  what seems to be happening recently is that a vet is scheduled for a review they meet with the doctor the doctor does not ask enough enquiring questions the vet does not know what symptoms or clinical evidence to tell the doctor and the next thing that happens is they get a va letter saying they have improved which equals a decreased rating i have personally talked to some va docs and contract docs who have told me i never ask about symptoms i want to see what they the vet shares with me if they dont bring up issues then i feel its not important another one said this they the vet have to prove to me they are disabled and another so many of these guys are out for the money its an easy monthly check now of course all docs are not like this but to go into a clinical interview and the doc is already prepared to deny benefits unless the veteran can prove their case is simply unprofessional clinically unsound and i believe unethical and in the end veterans are the ones who lose  the other reason this is occurring is that some vets do get better most vets will have a disability review scheduled by the va people do get better and the va wants to see if improvement has happened this is a legitimate reason to have a review of symptoms if psychological conditions have improved through medication or therapy then a rating of impairment would decrease the rating reflects improvement this would be clinically accurate unfortunately many examiners are overworked some care and some dont care sometimes they listen and take good notes sometimes they are tired and leave out important clinical information its the same in any other profession but in the end its the veterans report and it directly affects individual veterans and their families although some of these realities are terrible and some are infuriating but these are the facts these examples may explain why individual veterans can get a rating reduction however if a veteran gets a rating reduction and feels it is unfair unjust inaccurate or seems like it came out of the blue for no reason it can be challenged and i can help contact me im here to get this right for veterans brett valette phd clinical psychologist wwwveteranspsychevaluationscom,1

fifteen years ago i was addicted to opioids i had wrecked my back from various jobs the most likely culprit being as a cowboyactor at frontier town i saw one doctor after another trying to find a solution to my pain multiple doctors told me that surgery wouldnt do anything for me and that i just needed to manage the pain so i got a pain management doctor he prescribed hydrocodone telling me i could take as much as i wanted he said it wasnt addictive and yet i be  came addicted i kept taking more and more to control my pain after about six months of taking eight to nine pills a day i suddenly started prepping for the apocalypse my wife told me i was paranoid she looked up the symptoms of opioid abuse paranoia was one of the first ones listed like most addicts i told her i could quit anytime i wanted i quit cold turkey i thought i was going to die as i went through the opioid withdrawal i was lucky that i had a massive amount of support  from my family my friends and my workplace i never wanted to be addicted it wasnt a choice i was literally following doctors orders since this experience ive spent a lot of time researching initiatives both in this country and abroad i have talked to people who have opioid addictions or are in recovery mental health professionals public health officials elected officials and anyone that would talk to me about this issue these discussions and my own personal experiences have made me realize that there is no one simple solution we need a multifaceted approach to this public health crisis we need to take aggressive measures to combat this crisis the proposals that i bring forward are common sense bipartisan evidencebased ways to tackle this problem  fentanyl test strips  fentanyl is killing people every day fentanyl is the chief culprit in marylands dramatic increase in overdose deaths if we provide this inexpensive tool to atrisk populations we can at least ensure that the user is aware of the increased potential danger of the drug  legalize cannabis  studies have shown a correlation between having legal access to cannabis and lower opioid usage ratesas a comparatively safe alternative to opiates legalization would save taxpayers money by eliminating the costs of enforcement and incarceration for cannabis use and possession  needle exchange programs  taking this step will dramatically lower hiv transmission rates while also saving our health system money in the long run  increasing mental health providers  this would pay dividends to our society at large reducing crime lowering suicide rates lowering selfmedication and in the end lowering opioid use we need to expand access to services such as instituting the talbot county imbedded school therapist program statewide while also increasing incentives for individuals to enter the field such as covering student loans  remove the stigma surrounding mental health and addiction  people love awareness campaigns although they dont always do much help solve problems they do help make cracks in the stigma surrounding illness as portugal has shown when the stigma is removed from addiction the likelihood of people seeking treatment massively increases  decriminalize drug use  we want people to seek help not get used to lying to people about their behavior we have tried the war on drugsit failed decades after the war was declared we have an epidemic that kills more people per year than car accidents or aids ever did as the experiment in portugal has shown decriminalization drastically increases people seeking treatment without increasing opioid use this would not only be a costfree proposal to implement the reduced cost of lower incarceration rates can be redirected to provide treatment to those suffering from substance use disorders  give housing to the chronic homeless  as the city of salisbury program has shown this reduces costs for the city as it would statewide it is easier to get people into treatment if they have a stable address  increase public transportationaccess to addiction treatment and mental health providers  this should include utilizing new technologies like facetimeskype therapy as health officials in caroline county are already doing and even organizing rideshare programs on a county or state level if a program existed i believe this could be staffed with volunteers and possibly this can be done via a rideshare app developed by the state lack of access is a huge problem in rural communities  letters to doctors  this is tough as i know the doctor that prescribed me opioids was only trying to do one thing help me he was a good person who was trying to help me to not be in pain in my experience thats why doctors become doctors because they want to help people and heal people however there is research that shows if doctors receive letters informing them that their patients to whom they have prescribed opioids have died from an overdose they will prescribe less going forward  education for children and adults  if parents have opioids in their medicine cabinet those medications are not secure we want to believe that our children will not try opioids but we know they might remove the temptation and access perhaps most importantly talk to your kids about the danger of opioid use by the time you are done reading this another american will have died of an overdose we are losing our children we are losing our siblings we are losing our fathers our mothers our friends our artists our teachers our veterans but we are not helpless and we are certainly not hopeless we can learn from what others have done and take action to tackle this crisis however we cannot expect things to get better by just talking about it or just wearing purple awareness campaigns are important

impeach the president and the funding of fox too right now there are two types of americans both types know the presidents a liar know the presidents a cheater a bankrupt and more likely than not compromised by the russians the only difference is that one type believes what they know the other type has fox and its disinformation in their lives fox lies to its viewers and they are not random lies they are lies crafted to elect and support certain chosen politician  s that these are the same politicians our nations enemies wish to see in office says everything we need to know about fox except for whos funding fox and why you may have seen how through an odd series of events suddenly penzeys was in the news this last week it all started with us being ranked number two in facebook impeachment ad spending to just the president himself and ended up with us making the last small stepgiant leap of officially being done with pretending there is anything at all rational about this president being in the white house or about the party supporting him your response was just take our money we said how about sending us new customers instead then sales went whoosh this is not your fathers capitalism we pledged to put all the dollars of the new customer spending you brought us over those three days into penzeys ads on impeachment and here we are why begin with the top  funding fox truth is you can be the impeachiest impeacher who ever impeached and its still going to get you nowhere if you dont get to the root of the problem the issue here isnt the president hes just a symptom yes he has to go and judging from the latest house testimony the vice president as well but until americans address the disinformation machine of the republican party we are never going to rootout the corruption and cruelty that has overtaken the republican party we are a company of cooks who for some time now has believed you are what you advertise for us its about advertising the humankindness at the heart of cooking that when you care about others the world becomes a better place our somewhat unique style of marketing has made us the scouts riding up ahead of the pack doing our best to find the best way forward trying to see the future living in a time where political thought is no longer tied to rational thinking is no easy task no matter how many times you shake it the magic eight ball keeps coming up reply hazy try again later with us officially giving up on all the nonsensical reasons this president and his party hide behind weve already found in just a weeks time much has come into focus having passed through the fogginess of the irrational suddenly the future is right there out in front of us again from this plateau we now stand upon we can see the future is a hopeful one but it does look as though we are in for a substantial amount of turbulence before we get there the political landscape of america is in for the type of sudden shift we havent seen in close to fifty years you might want to buckle up one of the childhood memories that has stuck was when nixon was up for reelection in  and i was just in elementary school our teacher asked if you could vote would you vote to reelect the president one other kid and i were the only ones to not raise ours hands flash forward two years to shortly after nixons resignation and our teacher asked who would have voted to reelect the president for a moment i was thinking great heres where my classmates admit they were wrong and i was right but it didnt play out that way this time it played out the exact opposite with only two kids raising their hands to admit they wanted nixon reelected of course third graders when it comes to voting are pretty much a reflection of their parents thoughts but this has stuck with me a long time as something i could never quite reconcile i liked my wauwatosa wilson elementary classmates they were good sorts but why would they lie about something as important and as fundamentally american as this now coming to grips with our own nixon and in backandforthing with so many customers i think i finally understand their thinking they werent lying at all they were actually telling their truth nixon won the  election by a landslide yet two years later no one voted for him the thing was then like now his voters supported him because they believed him when he said he was not a crook once the process of impeachment began in the house of representatives and week by week the curtain was slowly pulled back the reality of the presidents crookedness became inescapable at that point his voters decided he was not who they thought they were voting for so therefore logically they didnt vote for him there is a lot of truth in this nixons supporters were unwavering right up until they wavered the parallels are strong to our time but just like nixons support was made up of voters who would never support a crook our presidents supporters are voters who would never support a cheating lying bankrupt russian government asset in the white house truth always outs and as much as we might hope the next step is a lot of republican voters taking responsibility for their actions thats not how humans work the next step is all about who to blame and it wont take long for the blame to arrive on those who worked to amplify foxs lies by funding their operation there was a time when every american ceo knew the lesson of what happened to those businesses in france that were seen as profiting from the nazi invasion and occupation oftentimes because those future ceos were marching through france on the way to germany when the retribution took place for the top  fox funders ceos if movies are your thing i recommend owning casablanca and watching it often please pay close attention to the scene towards the end where captain renault realizes the bottle of water he is pouring from is labeled vichy the french collaborators and with new found resolve trashes it that bottle is your brand and captain renault is every future american consumer dropping your brand into the waste basket of history if black and white film is not quite your style maybe your best bet is tuning in to what is happening in hong kong not  years ago but right this very moment it can seem like whats happening there is all random and chaotic but its not the peoples anger at those seen as promoting and profiting off the situation there is very much the same thing that will be happening here as reality settles in about how the enemies of our nation were able to gain influence over our highest offices of power right now as a top  fox funder your fingerprints are all over this crime my advice is its time to get out a rag and start wiping please at some point google penzeys  boycott our objection to the corruption and cruelty that has overtaken the republican party has taught us more than most about how boycotts work if you are a foxfunding  ceo trust me what you will be facing will be farfar more than just a boycott this is about arriving at pariah status this is about people not being able to take your product out in public because of the backlash they will receive this is about the end of resale value your job is to not let it come to this please do your job this is not the week to name the names of the top fifty fox advertisers this is about giving them the benefit of the doubt and about giving them time to make a change decades back when so many of the foxfunding  were just getting started maybe there was nothing wrong with marketing on the news of the left and of the right and everywhere in between but fox stopped being news a long time ago today advertising on fox is nothing more than writing a check to fund the lies that provide cover for the corruption and cruelty that has overtaken the republican party there is no hiding this anymore to the leaders of the foxfunding  please think of me as someone trying to help you have some very serious and very real choices to make is a funder of fox who you want to be or not your advertising contracts all have behavior clauses that fox right now is in violation of just visit their website the lies that they are spinning about the impeachment process are beyond excuse think of how much better it would be if this chapter in your companys history was about you choosing to do whats right not your company being forced to do what is right please step up and show the leadership you want to be remembered for now please please please the first tuesday of next month marks one year from the next presidential election if at that point you are still funding fox then america will have your answer and we will know our pleas fell short if its that your company benefits from the corruption and cruelty of the republican party and you want to keep funding fox so be it then it will be time to name names then you and i will catch beef and even though we are a progressive company with a lot of great seasoning options for nonmeat meals trust me when i say we still have manymany ways to bring an endless variety of tastiness to a beef with you for me there is sadness in all this because so many of the foxfunding  were up until now known as great american brands still if this is about clearing space for new american brands that celebrate the diversity and equality that fox and the republicans are doing everything they can to undermine then this is what this needs to be dang bill billpenzeyscom next time shorter and with recipes too i promise and with us trying to stretch our impeachment ad buy fund shares and comments mean more than ever also with us trying to amplify our message it would mean a lot if you could follow us on twitter penzeysspices and best of all sign up for our voice of cooking email list httpspicespenzeyscomvoicehtml thanks oh yeah and buying something at penzeyscom is how this all works our spices and seasonings are good and our

"members of commission vii dpr ri and head of bph migas support the use of lng for railway fuel
palembang member of commission vii dprri h yulian gunhar and head of bph migas m fanshurullah asa and bph migas committee ahmad rizal made a working visit to south sumatra province in order to carry out the function of supervising the oil and gas sector one of the work visit agendas in south sumatra is monitoring and supervising the use of certain types of fuel quotas jbt or subsidized diesel for consumers using passenger and goods public railways at pt kereta api persero divre iii palembang thursday  during the visit the director of facilities management of pt kereta api persero azahari
head of bph migas m fanshurullah asa on the occasion conveyed the subsidized diesel quota provided by bph migas to pt kai in  was  kl and the realization was  or  resulting in an overquota of  in  bph migas has provided a subsidized fuel quota for kai of  kl if multiplied by the retail selling price of rp  it is worth rp  trillion explained ifan a greeting for m fanshurullah asa
to prevent the occurrence of overquota in  the determination of the subsidized fuel quota is set every quarter for the first quarter the quota is set at  kl and the realization is  kl  then for the second quarter it was increased to  kl but due to the largescale social restrictions pspbb which had an impact on limiting train operations the realization was only  kl  for quarter iii the quota is the same as for quarter ii which is  kl explained ifan
ifan further said that he had checked that there was a freight train for export coal that uses subsidized fuel based on field checks there are freight trains for export coal to china india vietnam malaysia and brunei transporting an average of  million tons per month with fuel consumption of  thousand klmonth or around rp  billionmonth or  billion a year said ifan
ifan hopes that the use of subaidi diesel oil can be replaced with liquified natural gas lng so that fuel subsidies can be more efficient in addition to cheaper lng prices the use of lng is also cleaner energy
responding to this member of commission vii dpr ri from the pdip fraction for the south sumatra pdip dapil h yulian gunhar supports and encourages the use of liquefied natural gas or liquified natural gas lng as a rail fuel to be immediately implemented in the commercialization stage
just as the fuel oil subsidy is only for the indonesian people at home to move the economy so the use of freight trains for export commodities is not appropriate to be given a fuel subsidy therefore i support the use of lng as a fuel for trains replacing the use of diesel oil explained gunhar
according to gunhar the plan to use lng as a railway fuel has started since  which was marked by the signing of a memorandum of understanding between pt pertamina persero and pt kereta api indonesia persero pt kai on august   this is to support the government program in the context of energy diversification by converting the use of fuel to gas furthermore h yulian gunhar said that the use of lng as a train fuel has been used in several countries such as the usa canada russia and india
based on the results of the ddf lng trial on the power train carried out by pt kai persero in  witnessed by the head of the research and development agency of the ministry of energy and mineral resources showed a decline in consumption of diesel oil by  lng supply can be supplied from bontang with isotanks via sea and land routes
in addition to saving fuel costs the use of lng also has several advantages including as a clean and economical alternative fuel encouraging the use of natural gas in the country reducing imports and subsidies for diesel fuel diesel fuel reducing pollution caused by diesel engine emissions and extending the period maintenance of diesel engines so that maintenance costs are reduced
after making a working visit to pt kereta api persero divre iii palembang head of bph migas and the team made a field visit to pt bukit asam tanjung enim muara enim regency to see firsthand the operation of the coal transporting train and also to review the process of refueling for trains at the tanjung enim vhs facility

"in moving forward with my campaign there are objectives that i will commit to the citizens of this county these are in no certain order and will be considered a work in progress throughout my term as commissioner
the first objective is we have we must move to being a proactive commission versus a reactive commission that becomes cornered into decisions that are not in our best financial interest too many times we have been forced into a decision because of the inaction to provide solutions early on roads and trash are perfect examples
the second objective is becoming truly a transparent commission i support posting video feeds of each public meeting to allow those who are sick and shut in to view in the comfort of their own home the good news here is we have begun to do so with commissioner meetings we just have to perfect it perfect it by having all meetings recorded and having adequate audio so people can hear in addition to video feeds we will quit playing the quorum game when it comes to public meetings what does that mean well many times meeting are carefully set up without a quorum present  or more commissioners to disallow the legal requirement to hold the meeting in public form we will schedule lake authority meetings in the evenings so people who work can attend those meetings we are dealing with a m project largest the county will ever do paid for by the taxpayers so it is only right to provide a convenient time for citizens to attend
the third objective is to formulate a longterm trash solution overall the solution to our trash problem is multiple fold we have aging trash trucks and dumpsters we have folks digging in the trash we do not have a local dump for household trash and we have folks throwing trash out not in the dumpster the first decision that has to be made is is grady county going to stay in the trash business or are we going to source it if we are in we gotta make some capital investments if we are out we gotta get out sooner rather than later because our resources are deteriorated once we decide that we got to put an action plan in place my initial thought is yes we should be in the trash business which would include capital investments such as a landfill garbage truck and dumpsters currently our landfill owned by the city only takes white goods and nonhousehold garbage in a matter of years the landfill will be completely closed imagine the trash problem we will have then when a major storm hits and contractors have nowhere local to dump tree debris and damaged construction materials
the fourth objective is to provide a longterm fix to our aging roads and infrastructure the tsplost proposed will certainly fast track any solution unfortunately i do not like the idea of a new tax but folks our roads and infrastructure has been badly neglected for decades and without a boost from the tsplost we could be decades out providing an adequate solution i like the idea of the tsplost as  it is not solely on the back of the property owner  everyone even those that pass through the county pays something  unlike the splost which can be assigned across several projects the tsplost can only be used for transportation
the fifth objective is to gain nd amendment sanctuary status for grady county there are bills introduced into the georgia legislature frequently that try to infringe upon your right to bear arms some go as far to include semiautomatic guns which would include many sporting shotguns i support grady county to join the  other counties in georgia to become a nd amendment sanctuary
the sixth objective is progress on the tired creek lake project the constant financial drain this project has placed on our county has left us with back to back record property tax increases with diminishing services provided to the citizens the roads are filled with potholes the removal of dumpsites have left many citizens driving miles to dump their trash and our public safety has been impacted not receiving needing resources
these six objectives are just the beginning stages of us making a difference in grady county together we will make a positive impact for generations to come and together we will hit the bullseye
i commit to the citizens to use my experience and education to approach these objectives in a financially responsible way if there has been any time that we needed financial expertise on the commission board it is now due to covid there most certainly will be funding cuts from the state to include less money allocated to grants now is the time to make every dollar count each decision has to be a road map to the end goal of not increasing the mill rate at budget time we all have felt the financial crunch from covid and have adjusted our spending to live within our means it is time our county government does the same
i would welcome your support to be your district  commissioner early voting is going on now at the courthouse vote early so you dont forget on election day votejordan gradynewdirection
take care

"palembang member of commission vii dprri h yulian gunhar and head of bph migas m fanshurullah asa and bph migas committee ahmad rizal made a working visit to south sumatra province in order to carry out the supervisory function of the oil and gas sector one of the agenda for the working visit in south sumatra was a meeting with the governor of south sumatra h herman deru at the governor is office  the main issues discussed at the meeting were the supervision of certain types of fuel diesel subsidies and types of special fuel assignments premium assignments and the use of lng as rail fuel especially in the divre iii palembang area
at the meeting the head of bph migas m fanshurullah asa submitted a decree on quotas for certain types of fuel jbt or subsidized diesel and special assignment fuel types premium assignments for south sumatra province to the governor of south sumatra h herman deru the jbt quota set by bph migas in  is  kl an increase of  kl  from the  quota of  kl while the jbkp quota in  is the same as the  quota of  kl
member of commission vii dpr ri h yulian gunhar at a press conference after a meeting with the governor asked that the subsidized fuel quota that had been set by bph migas was right on target and could be sufficient until the end of  and there would be no overquota as in  as conveyed by the head bph migas from the jbt quota of  kl the realization reached  kl or 
therefore gunhar requested that the local government really actively participate in supervising the distribution of subsidized fuel so that it is right on target and the gas station digitization program that is currently being carried out by pt pertamina persero in collaboration with pt telkom can be used effectively to monitor the distribution of subsidized fuel
furthermore gunhar conveyed that according to the report submitted by the head of bph migas until august  the current development of gas station digitization carried out by pt pertamina persero has reached  or a total of  gas stations from the target of  gas stations throughout indonesia meanwhile for the province of south sumatra from the implementation target of  it nozzles connected to the dashboard of pt pertamina persero only  gas stations have been realized 
the gas station digitization system currently being developed is only limited to recording transaction volume and transaction sales value and recording of vehicle registration numbers is done manually using edc electronic data capture
i hope that this program can be implemented until it reaches the target of  percent in accordance with the promise of pertamina and telkom submitted to bph migas that the digitization of gas stations will be completely completed in august  and in the future it is necessary to improve the quality of digitalization such as monitoring with video analytic devices cctv said gunhar
gunhar found in the field that manual recording would add more work to gas station operators in addition the increased level of fatigue will also have an impact on the quality of its performance gunhar believes that the digitization of gas stations is very important
for this reason it is absolutely necessary to have a recording system using cctv that takes place automatically and in real time can be monitored continuously said yulian gunhar a member of the dpr ri pdip faction from the south sumatra ii dapil
the current digitalization activity is carried out in order to facilitate supervision of the distribution of assigned fuel and subsidies so that the volume is right and on target this will have an impact on saving subsidies disbursed by the government for the people in order to fulfill their energy needs
this spbu digitization program is a followup to bph migas regulation number  of  concerning the use of information technology systems in the distribution of fuel oil pt pertamina persero in cooperation with pt telkom indonesia built a gas station digitization program for a total of  gas stations spread across the territory of the republic of indonesia starting on august   with an initial target of completion by the end of december  but along the way the target changed several times due to obstacles in the field lastly pt pertamina pt pertamina persero and pt telkom indonesia is committed to completing nozzle digitization by the end of august 
regarding the use of liquified natural gas lng as a railway fuel as proposed by bph migas member of commission vii dpr ri h yulian gunhar supports and encourages immediate implementation in the commercialization stage especially in the south sumatra region this is based on the results of his visit with the head of bph migas and the bph migas committee ahmad rizal to pt kereta api persero divre iii palembang the day before just as subsidies for fuel oil are only for the indonesian people in the country to stimulate the economy so the use of export commodity freight trains is not appropriate to be given a fuel subsidy therefore i support the use of lng as fuel for trains replacing the use of diesel oil obviously gunhar
furthermore gunhar conveyed that based on an explanation from pt kai is plan to use lng as a train fuel has been started since  which was marked by the signing of a memorandum of understanding between pt pertamina persero and pt kereta api indonesia persero pt kai on august   this is to support government program in the context of energy diversification by converting the use of fuel to gas based on the results of the ddf lng trial on the power train carried out by pt kai persero in  witnessed by the head of the research and development agency of the ministry of energy and mineral resources showed a decline in consumption of diesel oil by  the use of lng as a rail fuel has also been used in several countries such as the usa canada russia and india
as previously informed the head of bph migas m fanshurullah asa conveyed the subsidized diesel quota provided by bph migas to pt kai in  was  kl and the realization was  or  resulting in an overquota of  in  bph migas has provided a subsidized fuel quota for kai of  kl if multiplied by the retail selling price of rp  it is worth rp  trillion explained ifan a greeting for m fanshurullah asa
to prevent the occurrence of overquota in  the determination of the subsidized fuel quota is set every quarter for the first quarter the quota was set at  kl and the realization was  kl  then for the second quarter it was increased to  kl but due to the largescale social restrictions pspbb for the prevention of covid which have an impact on operational restrictions for trains the realization is only  kl  for the third quarter the quota is the same as the second quarter which is  kl explained ifan
ifan further said that he had checked that there was a freight train for export coal that uses subsidized fuel based on field checks there are freight trains for export coal to china india vietnam malaysia and brunei transporting an average of  million tons per month with fuel consumption of  thousand klmonth or around rp  billionmonth or  billion a year said ifan
ifan hopes that the use of subaidi diesel oil can be replaced with liquified natural gas lng so that fuel subsidies can be more efficient in addition to cheaper lng prices the use of lng is also cleaner energy lng supply can be supplied from the oil and gas block in south sumatra which is famous for its gas granaries which are even exported to singapore and also flowed to java island through the transmission pipeline lng for trains in the south sumatra region all you have to do is tap from the transmission pipeline then regasify into lng storage in the kertapati area and its surroundings then channel it into an iso tank which is installed behind the train locomotive as fuel for locomotives and generator trains for lighting train carriages as shown in the figure has been used by the usa canada russia and india explained ifan
meanwhile the governor of the governor of south sumatra h herman deru welcomed the arrival of member of commission vii dprri h yulian gunhar and head of bph migas m fanshurullah asa and the bph migas committee ahmad rizal to south sumatra we receive the good news brought by them which will bring progress to south sumatra said herman deru after holding a meeting in the governor is meeting room with the parties in palembang friday 
herman deru said the first good news was related to the subsidized diesel fuel quota for south sumatra which was increased by  kl  from the  quota of  kl to  kl in  and is approaching an agreement with pt kai which will converting fuel from diesel to using lng and for south sumatra this will be the fifth country to use lng as fuel
this will be very beneficial because by using lng it will be more environmentally friendly and economical as for the start it is hoped that it will be realized in the near future with the agreement of pt kai bph migas and the indonesian house of representatives who have provided support
i myself hope that it will be as soon as possible because this will reduce exhaust emissions and hopefully this will become an example for this fifth world country but this must be a decision from the management said herman deru he added
meanwhile the selection of south sumatra as the area that implements the use of lng for trains is because the traffic using trains in south sumatra is very high for example to transport coal oil and others including for consumers who use the public railway passenger and goods transportation at pt kereta api persero division iii palembang
in addition the meeting with the governor also discussed optimizing regional revenue receipts from the motor vehicle fuel tax pbbkb collected from the sale of fuel from both jbt jbkp and jbu nonsubsidized bbm through exchanging sales data in south sumatra and bph oil and gas in addition it also discussed optimizing the establishment of subdistributors to serve bbm needs in certain locations that are still far from distributors and the acceleration of development of the bbm  price program so that people in the t region front disadvantaged outermost who in south sumatra enjoy the same fuel price namely diesel fuel amounting to rpliter and premium liter as a form of equitable distribution of justice in the energy sector as well as to improve the welfare and economy of the people in the t region

a genuine disciple february   a highschool friend was torn between his familys religious beliefs his dad had been an avowed atheist since college yet his mom lived a devoted christian life he settled on calling himself an agnostic this classmate became a respected medical doctor even though he still professed he was an agnostic he told me he decided to attend church because it was good for his public image sad but jesus encountered those with this dishonest  way of life nineteen times he called people hypocrites describing nonbelievers pretending they were righteous and holy to be seen by men but they do all their deeds to be noticed by men matt  in particular he condemned the pharisees and scribes for being hypocrites they blew trumpets in the synagogues and streets to call attention to their acts of generosity they prayed in public places so that people could see them and put on gloomy faces when they fasted so others would notice almost none of them accepted jesus as the messiah the barna group conducted an extensive research project asking nonchristians why they rejected christianity  responded that it was because the church was full of hypocrites several issues exist with this as an excuse first people who use this pretext dont know the biblical meaning of the term hypocrite they dont understand what the church is about or comprehend the distinction between a hypocrite and a genuine disciple the contemporary definition of a hypocrite and the biblical meaning arent the same skeptics try to impose twentyfirst century definitions on words in the bible the simplest biblical interpretation of hypocrisy is a religious performance to impress people it is a nonbeliever pretending to live a virtuous and moral life in public without a change of their heart becoming a genuine disciple begins in the heart these people honor me with their lips but their hearts are far from me mat  niv when we accept christ as our savior we are born again and he gives us a new spiritual heart if anyone is in christ he is a new creature the old things passed away behold new things have come  co  jesus enrolls us in his school of discipleship which means we become learners and will learn for the rest of lives graduation takes place in the final phase of salvation we call glorification then our perfecting will be complete the dead will be raised imperishable and we will be changed co  my students in bible college sought to make perfect grades but often failed to reach their goal that didnt disqualify them as students they kept trying bornagain believers are disciples striving for perfection we dont consistently reach that goal john gave the process to follow after we fail if we confess our sins he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness jn  it doesnt say confess our sins then chastise ourselves for several weeks attempting to add to jesus finished work no after we confess our sin and he forgives us we are to get up and continue striving for christlikeness that does not make the individual a hypocrite when he or she accepts gods forgiveness and keeps going a hypocrite is not a person who commits sin on occasions but they practice sins on a routine basis and continue pretending they are perfect a hypocrite has a terminal heart condition that requires a heart transplant a genuine disciple who has a new heart may have a hour bug but takes his medicine ie repentance and will try again tomorrow the church is supposed to be a hospital for spiritually sick people not a gallery of perfect men and women those that use the excuse the church is filled with hypocrites must never go to the doctor or hospital because it is full of sick people the church is a gathering of imperfect disciples seeking to become more perfect in their walk with christ by learning encouraging each other and worshipping god who has accepted them those who accuse true disciples with hypocrisy are the real hypocrites they try to deflect attention from their own brokenness by pointing out a genuine disciples failure not understanding god has forgiven the disciples failure note other characteristics a hypocrite is more concerned with correcting others than themselves they are judgmental jesus is referring to hypocrites when teaching about judging others why do you look at the speck that is in your brother is eye but do not notice the log that is in your own eye you hypocrite first take the log out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother is eye mat   a hypocrite overlooks all the righteous acts the person they are condemning has done they should consider peter who failed by cursing and vowing three times he did not know jesus yet fifty days later god anointed him to preach and  came to christ are there hypocrites in the church yes but the majority are genuine disciples most hypocrites are outside looking in sustaining word for the week have you received christ and become a genuine disciple if you have been accused of being a hypocrite rest in christs finished work and keep going,1

who writes a simple commoner but not an obscure lackey that is why i do not shut up compatriots i am writing to you to remind you that we must practice love in the times of covid this implies total cleanliness as well as love and care for our loved ones family members etc as complying with the law it goes against our will but it is the only way to combat covid by respecting the quarantine we will achieve i do not infect you nor do you infect me this is how it is being practiced worldwide and it is giving great results let is observe nature what animal should isolate itself and take refuge until the bad weather passes well nothing less than the bear let is follow that example in the proportion that concerns us but between the two there is an abysmal difference because when winter ends and spring blooms the bear will wake up from its lethargy leave its sweet home cave and look for its food as well as the love of its life instead when we leave our homes at the end of social isolation and before a new dawn in our lives when traveling through our cities our country or perhaps abroad we will see that everything changed diametrically most countries will be in an economic social and political collapse never seen or experienced before gone for this reason it is known in advance that the imf wb idb and other associated banks have almost  billion dollars in their coffers not counting what china has everyone willing to lend them to those who need it of course there will be many including us well we will be facing a new world order of which we do not have why scare us but if we act with prudence since geopolitics and the world economy are like that as the sailors say after the storm comes calm what we must be careful and spin fine at the end of this pandemic making use of our resilience is that we must unite in order to build a good political party with a broad base that does not have a straw among its members goodbye corrupt not to the merchants of education not to the swindlers of social security not traffickers terrorists smugglers drug traffickers illegal miners merchants industrialists and corrupt builders former authorities and corrupt politicians etc for this reason following my editorial line with all humility i propose that the new broadbased political project be called peruvian people is progressive party and what will it do for citizens to integrate the famous political party mentioned above in first place it is a new political wave bringing innovation for  in the field of social sciences economics and technology in second place as a requirement its members and future applicants must be young people and people with a youthful spirit in tercer lugar the raison detre of the singular political party is to be pragmatic par excellence and not dogmatic by habit in fourth place as a yearold promoter you lie down but with a spirited youthful spirit i feel admiration as an arequipeno boy named jose a quisocala condori at  years old has created the ecological bank being his general manager recognized with the stockholm award and i am just trying to do something for my poor peru what does this reallife example teach us that we should not expect the state to give us everything to live when the situation is normal we must create and fight to obtain everything we need in fifth place the supreme goal of the state and society is the human person and his dignity and the protection of indemnity for him at work in sixth place since the party claims to be creators innovators and workers it proposes as a platform the creation and dissemination of disseminated shareholders by the state creating the investment and development bank but with a roof seventh all young people between the ages of  and until they graduate professionally andor technically can create junior companies with state guarantees and both state and private educational institutions with a market reserve for their purchasessales in eighth place after four years of learning and knowledge senior companies can be created who with capacity and solvency will be able to collaborate and compete in the national and international market in ninth place volunteering will be encouraged among young people for a period of two years so that they help their compatriots and get to know all of peru by providing their services in all state institutions without exception receiving a diet insurance and at the end a certificate that will have the value of  of the score to apply for any job andor studies be it state private or mixed in tenth place pensions must be collected and paid only by the state thus the contributions are guaranteed and updated over time in eleventh place the hospitals will be administered by a board of directors made up of a doctor a nurse an administrative officer three members of the local civil society and a representative of the ministry of health all elected for said purpose in twelfth place citizen security being of vital importance when innovating the constitution who causes the death of a person by fraudulent action will be applied the death penalty without exceptions in thirteenth place being that the justice emanates from the people a jury will issue its verdict goodbye corrupt judge in fourteenth place reelection is feasible for the only time as long as the person is worthy of it and the social and economic cycles allow it in fifteenth place the construction of the bullet train will be promoted from tumbes to tacna linking the coast from north to south and vice versa as well as giving greater fluidity to international traffic between ecuador and chile goodbye accidents goodbye assaults goodbye staying up late but without costing the state a penny from the national treasury finally our society runs between a dilemma the submissive who do not dare to break the chains of conformism suffering from apathy and indifference which is why they perceive in their lives an insurmountable frontier to achieve progress however the irreverent  through innovation we perceive a majestic horizon therefore i ask you to which sector of society do you think you should belong if you agree and give them like or i love please do not forget to share and comment otherwise if it is not to the reader is liking it is recommended to turn the page and goodbye headache and liver sincerely yours

"lg is promise of dialogue and development jammu needs attention to its aspirations
sahil mahajan
new lieutenant governor of jammu and kashmir manoj sinha has started his innings in the union territory he has stirred hopes of a new era visiting jk with his ideas a mix of tradition and innovation it is however to be seen where exactly jammu region stands in his scheme of things
undoubtedly kashmir is under greater spotlight because of the peculiar situation over there yet jammu has its own situation and demands that are quite different from that of the valley the region deserves as much attention as the valley
it is needless to draw a comparison between two regions it is rather well known jammu has greater linkages with the national mainstream politically and geographically and of late it is also at the ideological level beyond the spirit of patriotism that has always been the hallmark of jammu
since the lg has given an expression to  hold direct dialogue with the people and listen to their grievances and to make efforts to redress these it is firmly hoped that the grievances of jammu region would find an equal attention of sinha and the administration that he now heads in jammu and kashmir
geographically culturally ethnically and linguistically diverse jammu region has its own compulsions not to air its grievances as loudly as the people would have done at any other place in the country jammu is destiny is linked to kashmir because of the history that determines its geography too at the same time jammu is committed in all ways and means to the indian nationhood
therefore it has to be cautious with its words and actions ensuring that nothing goes wrong that may impact the situation in the valley it is aware that it has to make sacrifices in the national interest for that reason it has kept a lid on many of its grievances
that should not mean that there should be no understanding of its concerns or no efforts should be made to keep jammu is aspirations in mind what is important is that jammu deserves not only its due as a region that is part of jammu and kashmir but also needs to be rewarded for the sacrifices it has made for the nation the reward should not be mistaken as a compensation
manoj sinha by his work and training is a politician who it is learnt knows how to read the pulse of the people so it should not be difficult for him to understand what jammu needs and how that can be delivered as he is a bjp man and the saffron party has its deep roots in jammu it is incumbent upon his party to articulate the region is grievances which should be fair and objective in the first place the bjp leaders of jammu should not be shy of spelling things in a camouflaged vocabulary to be here and there too or neither here nor there
then other parties that operate in jammu including congress jk national panthers party bahujan samaj party and other big or small groups too should be involved in the dialogue process because they are the also part of the mainstream that have interests in jk and the nation as well that will send a very powerful message to the people that their nationalistic credentials have been recognized and rewarded
economically its sufferings and potential also need a closer look the details on its safe environment and entrepreneurship cannot be overemphasized this is not a comparison but a statement of facts there are social and other issues and each one of them can be addressed stepwise",1

doctors nurses and nurses who treat this disease are required to follow a strict set of rules to manage the risks of highly contagious outbreaks

"can infrigements threat in slovakia
slovaks and slovaks dear friends
fulfilling the mep is duty to inform citizens about its activities as well as the duty of a member of the ep is internal market and consumer protection committee imco i would like to point out not criticize or attack the possible incompatibility of governmentadopted legal standards with eu law
if you are affected by the current pandemic so that you are not in a position to repay the agreed monthly loan installments you have the option of requesting a bank nonbanking company or leasing company to defer the installments
on april   the national council of the slovak republic approved a bill that will allow consumers small and mediumsized enterprises to defer loan repayments for consumer loans and mortgages in banks by  months and in nonbank and leasing companies by a maximum of  months this is act no  zz on certain emergency financial measures in connection with the spread of covid as amended  effective from  and its economic impact on slovak consumers in connection with the possibility of deferring the repayment of consumer loans and housing loans
according to the available information the banking sector registers more than  such requests
the deputies of the national council of the slovak republic declared that they had negotiated advantageous assistance to the citizens in the form of postponement of the agreed monthly installments however this may not be the case objectively that is why as a member of the european parliament and a member of the committee on the internal market and consumer protection i have decided to point out the possible incompatibility of this law with eu law i provided the ministry of finance with comments on the proposed amendment later reservations about the already approved law and i am aware that civic associations providing consumer protection have proceeded in a similar way if i have the right information the ministry of finance sent the answer only to me which i consider good because when solving professional issues mutual discussion commenting is appropriate and is free from the socalled political blabbering first of all i pointed out some possible mistakes that i do not want to break down because it would require more space and professional discussion but in short that is probably what it is about
what may be the unfairness of deferred payments and conflict with eu law and slovak law i do not consider it acceptable that none of the competent recommenders deferred the credit insurance and that consumers can turn to insurance companies and do not have to make use of the deferral
in my opinion it is also necessary to consider the fact that the consumer contract is amended by the request for deferral of payments provision of d of act no  coll the consumer does not know about the new terms of the loan before applying for deferment based on the above it should be an interest free and fee free deferral of installments provision of  paragraph  letter h of act no  coll on consumer credit if of course the legislator did not exclude the entire period of deferral in breach of eu law from the scope of the consumer credit act it is also a controversial but also debatable legal regulation which denied consumers the right to their protection by applying the provisions of g par 
the law as approved by the government may in its detailed analysis run counter to the euroconform interpretation of consumer protection law directive  eec of 
if i were not wrong in my legal opinion in the future it would presuppose a number of lawsuits and complaints against the ec and the resulting possible proceedings against the slovak republic the socalled infrigements but id rather be wrong however it is always necessary to professionally discuss rethink and carefully consider things in the future and for a simple reason if we are threatened with sanctions from brussels it will be borne only by the citizen which must also be avoided by commenting on the laws
in this context i cannot fail to refer to the program statement of the government of the slovak republic i quote the government of the slovak republic will introduce a functional mechanism of material responsibility and punishment of mistakes of public officials in the management of public funds
it would therefore be appropriate at the very least for the government to implement this mechanism as a matter of priority and only subsequently to approve the laws simply to stick to its program statement and not pass on the responsibility and possible sanctions of the commission to the shoulders of the citizens in order to bear a specific person and this is how the previous government as well as the governments before should have done and then politicians deputies ministers and other public figures would be more careful and more accessible to professional communication in the enforcement of legal norms without the socalled political blabbering

"assembly member linda rosenthal and state senator luis sepulveda have introduced a bill in new york state that would close all live animal markets specifically prohibiting the operation of establishments where animals andor fowls are slaughtered or butchered for food it will also establish a task force to decide whether they should be banned indefinitely
while this is an outlandish piece of legislation this latest move from rosenthal comes as no surprise she has spent her career working against animal agriculture as well as other animal industries such as limiting hunting banning pet breeding and sales banning horse drawn carriages rodeos and more over the years we have written a number of articles about rosenthal is animal extremism and the legislation she has proposed these articles can be found on our website with a simple search if you are interested in learning more
bills introduced in both the senate and assembly
there are two identical versions of this bill being presented in both the new york senate and assembly the assembly bill a has been introduced by linda rosenthal d and the senate version s by state senator luis sepulveda d both bills are currently in committee awaiting to be heard on the floor these two legislators are working in conjunction to close the  live markets that reside in the state of new york
false claims versus the facts
in a statement rosenthal has falsely claimed that these facilities do not adhere to any sanitary guidelines nor do they see any regulation or oversight the truth is that the new york state department of agriculture and markets nystam is directly responsible for overseeing and regulating live animal markets in the state according to their  annual report the department of animal industry dia tested over  birds that year at several hundred different markets and dealers and none were positive for the avian flu the same can be said for  as well the department of animal industry is made up of a staff of field and office veterinarians animal health inspectors and more all dedicated to ensuring that the animals going through those markets are healthy and safe for human consumption
the nysdam annual report also explains that
domestic animal health permits dahp are issued to livestock and poultry dealers department laws and regulations require dealers to properly identify animals and record the details of all transactions to allow for tracing to the point of origin and disposition dai veterinarians and animal health inspectors conducted  dahp inspections on  dahp holders during  field staff also inspect livestock markets to determine compliance with department laws and regulations in general market inspections are performed quarterly and consist of a facility inspection evaluation of cleaning and disinfection procedures and an inspection of animal identification and recordkeeping practices dai field veterinarians and animal health inspectors performed  livestock market inspections on  markets
this proves that not only is there oversight and regulation pertaining to live animal markets in new york but also that those regulations are being implemented successfully as a lawmaker in the state of new york rosenthal should know this if she is aware of the department of animal industry is veterinarians and animal health inspectors then what does that say about the claims she is making
legislators ties to the animal extremist movement
linda rosenthal has spent her entire career sponsoring outrageous legislation that pushes forward the ideology and agenda of animal extremist organizations some of the language in her legislation has been so restrictive that it would make it impossible to even have a pet dog just this year she proposed a bill that would limit options for pet owners by banning pet stores from selling dogs cats and rabbits she has solidly aligned herself with organizations and legislation that seeks to limit animal ownership in the state and animal industries that reside there the animal extremist group the humane society of the united states awarded rosenthal with the humane legislator of the year award based on her efforts to push legislation that aligns with their movement
luis sepulveda is closely associated with nyclass an animal rights organization we have highlighted before especially due to their continued efforts to ban carriage horses in new york city nyclass has endorsed both sepulveda and rosenthal among others based on their cooperation with carriage horse bans
misinformation must be addressed
amidst the coronavirus pandemic there have been several claims from animal extremist groups that are blatantly false regarding its connection to animals while the pandemic has been traced back to originating in bats it is false to claim that animal agriculture is to blame we as an organization refuse to sit idly by as animal agriculture is maligned by those who benefit from its demise this pandemic has affected most of us in some way however this situation has proven the importance of standing strong with our food producers and supporting them as much as possible we will continue to share truthful information about food production and will never stop bringing animal extremism to light",1

coverup tonight is council meeting had a surprise report from the use of force expert the report was not on the advance agenda callison inserted it at the last minute which was obviously a tactic so the council did not have time to go over the report and think about it so they could better ask questions it was also probably a technique to ensure that people would not turn out the way they would have if they had known this was on the agenda unfortunately the council didn  t insist that mr carpenter come back another time when his presence could be advertised in advance so any who cared could come listen the report was about as useful as i though it would be which is not at all useful the differences between the officers statements and marks statements were excused via cherry picking statements out of context and attributing differences in the statements to the the inaccuracy of old memories due to amount of time that elapsed between between the event and the statements of shoudy and brewer he did not seem to apply to same standard to mark is statement which was just as old and he said other things that were simply not factual which is odd to say the least because they are so easy to check for example he said that shoudy was  feet away when the incident happened implying that he could not have seen well enough from that distance to know what was going on but shoudy is statement says that yes when he first saw brewer marks and procapio he was  feet away but by the time the leg sweep took place he was on procapio is right side while brewer was on the right and marks was behind he was hired to represent callison is and marks side of events and he did as well as could be done with poor material for example citing overwhelming general statistics of how much trouble a handcuffed person could cause rather than the facts of the current matter he cherry picked outofcontext statements from the banks report he went exhaustively into procopio is prior bad history but said nothing about marks prior bad history because he was not given that information even the complaint charlie and i made in  was absent since it had aged out of the required record is retention system the fact that others have tried to make a complaint and were not offered a way to do so was also not shared with him he was a salesman using salesman techniques like the insertion of mounds of irrelevant facts in an attempt to obscure the basic issue and attempting to draw in the audience to his side by addressing it in a folksy manner and asking it to imagine things from marks point of view he spends a lot of time in court trying to persuade juries to believe the side that is paying him and it showed in his manner i continue to think that the liability issue the the main insurmountable issue for the city how can you keep someone with such a strong history of bad behavior and not expose the city to lawsuits but who knows we live in strange days,1

come let us adore him now at this time mary arose and hurried to the hill country to a city of judah judea and she entered the house of zacharias and greeted elizabeth here is to me the most exciting spiritual event that happened in the christmas story pay strict attention to what went on here i have never heard it taught in the church in detail it is so cool when elizabeth heard marys greeting her baby leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy spirit and empowered by him and she exclaimed loudly blessed worthy to be praised are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb and how has it happened to me that the mother of my lord would come to me for behold when the sound of your greeting reached my ears the baby in my womb leaped for joy and blessed spiritually fortunate and favored by god is she who believed and confidently trusted that there would be a fulfillment of the things that were spoken to her by the angel sent from the lord one of my most frequently asked questions is this pastor allen if jesus aint gonna do nothin because he already did everything and he already answered all of my prayers and has already given to me all things that pertain to life and godliness what do i have to do to receive all of those great and precious blood guaranteed promises of jesus the answer is in that scripture blessed is she who believed and confidently trusted that there would be a fulfillment of the things that wwere spoken to her from the lord be honest with yourself and ask if a you know all of the things that were promised you from the lord b do you believe all of the things that were promised you by jesus do you believe that jesus healed every disease known and unknown to man on the cross isaiah  matthew psalm  do you believe that jesus forgave and chose to never remember your sins all of them past present and future once and for allhebrews  hebrews  psalms amp zephaniah  do you believe that jesus defeated satan and gave you dominion over him and all of his powers luke  do you believe that jesus gave you the power to do the same things that he did and even greater things and that he promised to do whatever you ask of him john do you believe that jesus has given you the power to speak and command all things and that they must obey you mark  go back and reread those verses over and over until you get what happened think about this mary was not showing she had just then been impregnated by the holy spirit elizabeth had no way to know that she was pregnant she especially had no way to know that mary would deliver god into the world in a flesh suit nor did she know what mary said to gabriel elizabeth had no means by which she could know what marys reaction to gabriel was here is what happened remember that gabriel told zachariah that john elizabeths son would be filled with the holy spirit from conception when mary stood in the presence of john in elizabeths womb john drunk in the power of the holy spirit leaped for joy because he knew that he was in the presence of god at that instant elizabeth was filled with the holy spirit and was given spiritual vision and understanding she knew everything in the blink of an eye doesnt that scene send cold chills up your spine who could have made up such an event read this astonishing faith statement from mary catholics know marys dissertation as the magnificat jesus never asked us to make confessions if he had this would be the perfect example along with the psalms of david of what he would like it is an effervescent joyful loving positive and happy prophetic praise to god the father born in faith beyond comprehension the magnificat is one of the many reasons that i admire mary and mary said my soul magnifies and exalts the lord and my spirit has rejoiced in god my savior for he has looked with loving care on the humble state of his maidservant for behold from now on all generations will count me blessed and happy and favored by god for he who is mighty has done great things for me and holy is his name to be worshiped in his purity majesty and gloryand his mercy is upon generation after generation toward those who stand in great awe of god and fear him he has done mighty deeds with his powerful arm he has scattered those who were proud in the thoughts of their heart he has brought down rulers from their thrones and exalted those who were humble he has filled the hungry with good things and sent the rich away emptyhanded he has helped his servant israel in remembrance of his mercy just as he promised to our fathers to abraham and to his descendants forever and mary stayed with elizabeth for about three months and then returned to her home please reread this power packed message to you from the holy spirit it is

"i succeeded without military leadership let no agitator say that we have no places in hospitals we have to protect ourselves individually but the authorities have an obligation to organize today i give another example of good practice i opened the covid modular hospital in pipera with  seats that can be expanded to  seats you dont need a hospital but if something happens were here get ready to help
the medical unit is intended for covid patients with light forms and will function as an external section of the dr victor babes infectious and tropical diseases hospital
the capital city hall through assmb provided everything necessary from the construction of the spaces to their endowment the provision of services and staff the purchase of medicines and sanitary materials
the hospital has an operating permit issued by the dsp granted two months after the written request dont comment it is a joke
we got used to the delays of this institution
starting yesterday the medical staff who agreed to work in the modular hospital were seconded  doctors nurses and nurses out of which  from the hospitals of the capital city hall and  from the assmb school of medicine network these are the medical staff for the first  patients
admission of patients to the pipera modular outpatient department will be made after their initial evaluation clinical and radiological at the hospital of infectious and tropical diseases dr victor babes  which continues to treat the largest number of infected patients among all covid hospitals
patients who arrive here will benefit from special conditions each salon having at most two beds and being provided with air conditioning washbasin bathroom with shower toilet and boiler to ensure the necessary hot water
the lounges also have tvs and internet access
at the same time there are a number of rooms for medical staff equipped with everything you need to ensure the necessary level of comfort
the modular hospital was built in record time by the capital city hall through the metropolitan buildings trust and the company for the consolidation of buildings with seismic risk
all the services necessary for the proper functioning are ensured by concluding contracts for maintenance and cleaning collection and neutralization of biological waste security catering telephony internet as well as the usual utilities water electricity etc
medicines sanitary materials disinfectants consumables uniforms and protective equipment for medical staff pajamas for patients etc were purchased
the spaces are equipped with strictly necessary furniture and equipment refrigerators beds chairs tables bedside tables bins locker rooms etc assmb also benefiting from the support of dgasmb and the hospitals under administration
the approximate value of all these acquisitions made by assmb for the modular hospital amounts to  lei

"a year in parliament the intention was to achieve  percent in the province of antwerp exactly one year ago impossible carl devos said on television and some cackled after him we went on and what did we do we clocked in at  percent across the province and we went from  to  elected representatives in the federal parliament from  to  elected representatives in the flemish parliament we got our first european elected representatives and another  in the walloon parliament and  in the brussels parliament bam from  to  supralocal mandate holders a year ago
today i am surrounded in parliament i am surrounded by more than a century of trade union experience that is only possible with our group with gaby colebunders former union representative of ford genk do you remember his first intervention a fiery indictment against racism when the asylum center of bilzen was set on fire by farright pyromaniacs for thirty years the miners have been asking for their pension to be rectified it is only when miner is son gaby colebunders enters parliament that things finally get going chance maybe what is certain is that gaby will sink his teeth into it until it is arranged and that the liberal ministers are crazy about colere a large lobby group of the miners that is what they call gaby and co that is a nice compliment the pvda as a more efficient megaphone of the working class
also think of maria vindevoghel for twenty years she has been cleaning the airport of brussels in the cleaning would she have known then that she is shaking up parliamentarians from the stands today about the future of the airport madam minister i have experienced it myself says maria with roberto damico after  years of night shift at caterpillar in gosselies to parliament with nadia moscufo  years of service at aldi the fiery trade union woman from liege gaby maria roberto nadia working class heroes in parliament
street council street that is our starting point we listen to what is going on in the workplace and in the neighbourhood we will bring this to parliament substantiated with proposals from our research department and staff and afterwards we bring it back to the workplace and the neighbourhood we have a wonderful team of dozens of employees who study who contact the unions or professors or civil society who are looking for testimonials who prepare the interventions in parliament who record subtitle publish the videos those who are on site do research and listen most importantly listen my deepest respect for all those teams in the federal european flemish walloon and brussels parliament and in the senate no routines no cabinet members no springboard careerists but all new people with a big social heart much respect to all those companeras y companeros and thumbs up also to raoul hedebouw pvda nadia moscufo ruben ramboer marco van hees gille feyaerts and loonis logghe who lead the entire group
best moment of the past year our emergency fund for healthcare we have worked hard for that populism the liberals and nva shouted in unison any miscreant can get any crazy proposal through parliament said servais verherstraeten cdv about our health care fund insane proposal and about me miscreant but we continued and the  million euros extra for healthcare came the telephone from a hospital in early april that the money from our fund had arrived made me shed a tear our change is working
say do you really think that all those people forgot about that right away or what when sofie merckx gets angry she speaks antwerp she has been living in charleroi for years and is a gp there for medicine for het volk perfectly bilingual such as raoul hedebouw pvda from liege and thierry warmoes from namur sofie was able to put her stamp on barely a year she has helped to ensure that patient associations have a place and an advisory voice on the pharmaceutical reimbursement committee during the corona crisis she makes the voice of medicine voor het volk heard in a debate that is colored by  different ministers of mouth masks and even more ministers responsible for public health today sophie is fighting to have covid recognized as an occupational disease an important bill that may be able to pass sophie makes no distinction brussels resident fleming or waal they all count for us that we are one national party the red devils of politics it still makes all other factions uncomfortable
we have a very diverse group there is raoul hedebouw pvda he is incomparable passionate committed strong he is the engine of the team there are the calm interventions of greet daems equally involved substantiated convincing you should do it anyway as a newcomer to that macho parliament you have the passion of nabil boukili when he defends the palestinians in the foreign policy debates and the tranquility of steven de vuyst who sits next to me in that parliament steven is alderman of the pvda in zelzate on the ghentterneuzen canal together with borgerhout this is the reddest spot in the north of the country steven is on the social affairs committee on december  he and raoul hedebouw submitted the country is first civil law act to the chamber of representatives the request to increase the minimum pension in our country to  euros net in the meantime we had collected more than  signatures with the entire party in the meantime we are five months after the submission and parliament continues to use all possible tricks to avoid discussing our proposal
we have been active in the federal parliament for a year now the classical parties accuse us of populism because we dare to propose that mps would give half a month is wages for the fight against corona this is done in dozens of countries with us all classical parties arrogantly sweep such a proposal off the table last week things were once again up in the air when we proposed to introduce a corona tax on multimillionaires to pay the bill for the crisis one economist after another in europe meanwhile is convinced that it is high time to make the very rich contribute instead of allowing wealth inequality to grow into a frenzied chasm but with us the traditional parties have become so arrogant that they dont want to see or hear real political innovation people no longer like that our proposals do according to the latest polls we would keep all our voters from last year and add another half of new voters we will see
one thing is certain we will continue you force change throughout society parliamentary work is just a megaphone of what is happening on the ground a megaphone for the working class a megaphone for honest politics a megaphone for change i promised that exactly one year ago we do our best with all our base groups with all our members and employees in the neighborhoods and in the workplace as dirk van duppen put it the pvda with extraordinary people who are ordinary and with ordinary people who are extraordinary with light workers and with shadow workers i see the world tipping i believe it will be okay",1

money donated to hsus is used to train law enforcement and to meddle in environmental issues law enforcement agencies are being influenced by animal rights groups animal rights groups have become an influence on law enforcement not only through award ceremonies for example handing out humane law enforcement awards but through training as well the humane society of the united states hsus has provided many states cities and counties with material and workshops about how  to enforce animal laws and conduct seizures then after the workshops they have awarded outstanding officers and departments for their efforts this animal rights influence on law enforcement is a justifiable cause for worry amongst people who own animals the hsus has been known to take extreme measures to end all animal ownership and production they have also been known to participate in seizures and use those seizures raise considerable funds to pad their coffers therefore with law enforcement receiving training and encouragement by animal rights extremists animal rights groups are one step closer to achieving their goal of ending animal ownership training sessions offered by hsus to law enforcement the humane society of the united states training sessions for various law enforcement officers covers the following  background on animal fighting and illegal animal abuse including relevant laws  the unproven claim that animal abuse leads to other violent crimes  investigating cruelty complaints from first response to filing charges  recognizing key evidence warrants and statements most of these trainings are free to law enforcement departments trainers are former and current officers that have an expertise in finding the loopholes in animal protection laws that can be used against animal owners they also have expertise in conducting seizures the hsus website claims the animal rescue team has a long and successful track record with prosecutors judges and law enforcement law enforcement agencies across the country call upon us to assist with the investigation and prosecution of every type of animal abuse training of north dakota law enforcement often when people hear about the hsus inserting themselves into law enforcement they dismiss it thinking it doesnt impact them and that it will never happen in our agricultural state it does happen and in fact the hsus targets states and communities where they believe they can slip in without much opposition what happened in north dakota is a prime example the hsus pushed a ballot initiative in north dakota titled prevention of animal cruelty in hopes of making voters believe they were helping animals voters did not fall for the misleading legislation and voted down the initiative however the hsus was not deterred via back door methods they were able to make changes to the century code and passed similar laws as outlined in their ballot initiative despite the will of the people then they proceeded to train law enforcement on the new law which allows for an actionable claim from out of state callers and the seizure and sale of animals without notice to the owner or hearing to establish guilt or wrongdoing but thats not all  hsus asserts itself in environmental issues sealions the hsus meddles in the ecosystem with their lawsuits against removal of sea lions at the bonneville dam they have filed lawsuits against the us department of fish and wildlife multiple times creating issues with populations of salmon steelhead white sturgeon and orca their agenda is selfish as they are choosing one species and disregarding many others who are at risk of becoming endangered or are already endangered wild horses the hsus has been known for its farreaching tentacles this is proven in their activities around horses on american rangelands the hsus had teamed up with wild horse extremistactivist groups to file lawsuits and to stop the blm from being able to properly manage the horse populations what most people dont know is that the hsus has a patent on pzp a birth control vaccine therefore the hsus isnt concerned about the wild horse population as much as they are worried about their own finances environmental police awarded by humane society on july th in massachusetts environmental police officer major patrick moran as well as the board of wildlife violator compact administrators were honored by the humane society of the united states with the  humane law enforcement award environmental police are otherwise known as game wardens in massachusetts and team up with other state agencies as a part of the environmental crimes strike force according to the massgov website the environmental crimes strike force investigates and prosecutes crimes that harm the state is air land or water or that pose a significant threat to human health the strike force is an interagency team that includes prosecutors from the attorney general is office officers from the massachusetts environmental police and investigators engineers and attorneys from the massachusetts department of environmental protection dep misleading the public these agencies teaming up with hsus are worrisome considering the power they have in their respective communities they certainly are misleading the public about where their money goes when they run ads about shelter animals on television,1

executive director statement on  december  restinpower and end of the year fundraising i began volunteering as a board member with swopusa in the fall of  i had been doing sex work formally for  years and had been doing social justice organizing for  i was raised as a liberal feminist and considered sex work to be a violation i actually protested a girls gone wild recording at a bar in my college town im ashamed of it but it happened at a certain point i r  an out of money and had to take some time off of school i worked retail and it was grueling and i was constantly harassed by mall customers and employees despite my reservations i started doing sex work expecting to hate it but low and behold is has become my most longlasting and consistent work i came into this new project as many organizers do  naive ambitious and with the firm belief that tremendous change was just around the corner after three years on the board and eventually transitioning to the role of inaugural executive director of swopusa i can rest assured its a much longer journey than i had ever anticipated the fight for sex workers rights is complicated and nuanced best practices of the past arent sufficient we are at a crucial moment in the sex workers rights movement our elders fought long and hard for the safety and dignity that we benefit from today but it is not enough we come into another december th with staggering numbers of sex workers who have lost their lives to violence  was a year that we saw brutal violence committed against women of color domestically abroad and at the border everyone knows and loves someone who is a sex worker and those sex workers intersect with and experience every other system of oppression and institution of violence decriminalization as a public health and harm reduction strategy remains an essential pillar of swopusas mission additionally we must address the larger systems that would make decriminalization only a benefit to those already in positions of power criminalization spans much further than sex workers and it impacts us differently black and brown and trans individuals would continue to face extreme policing and violence even if we achieved decriminalization tomorrow our struggle must be intersectional or it is lost this past october the swopusa board of directors and myself participated in the early stages of our strategic planning one of the processes we engaged with was to imagine what december th events could look like in  years it was a struggle for many of us to look so far into the future and try to imagine something brighter more just a world transitioning away from white supremacy and criminalization one of the most tangible points that came out of this conversation was that up until now we have only honored sex workers who have lost their lives we had previously failed to name many other forms of violence violence that is not always immediately fatal  such as incarceration violence resulting from white supremacy trans erasure stigma poverty drug use and so much more this year and for all the years to come we must center the voices and experiences of those impacted by all forms of criminalization we believe that the work of building power and developing activists skills is essential to moving forward as a movement we need a movement of leaders if we want to win and we believe that sex workers will win we could not do this work without our direct community or our generous donors and funders we did not meet our goals for foundation funding for  as unfortunately few foundations directly support our fight and we are in danger of not being able to move forward with some of our funding we need you to you to help keep moving our grassroots organizing forward we currently are running our end of the year fundraising drive in order to continue to support our chapters and projects any contribution tax deductible would be tremendously appreciated and goes directly to funding sex workerled organizing,1

"may st 
 am
morning note how we are recovering
it is nice to return after a holiday weekend and the market has positioned itself to open up about  points
there are still many questions about the stock market and the impact of covid we saw that in the shakiness of trading on friday before a holiday weekend
some investors are still feeling timid and would rather be out of the market before a holiday weekend
however as we are seeing today a penalty is being applied if an investor is looking today at trying to buy into a  point rally day that could go higher this has happened several times since early march and it also happened in the early part of  and that ended up being a great year for the market
in midmarch through today i have been advising clients to reposition some holdings to pick up some great name companies that were in a position to benefit from current market conditions
in the  to  days some of those positions have increased substantially and in some accounts greater than  i have shared my thoughts to nonclients and advised them to review any investments with high expenses or poorperformance in their portfolios and to make changes
the market recovery has been selective but investors should not be surprised companies like microsoft zoom beyond meat amd facebook the g sector and mediacommunication holdings have done extremely well
i have had concerns about financials and the insurance sector during this time since low interest rates do not favor these industries at the moment also they have not performed well
if investors check their mutual fund holding they may see that those funds hold big positions in financials and should not be surprised if those mutual funds are negative for the year
the big question on most people is minds is when will we get a vaccine for the virus
i am not as focused on that question since more than  different companies are working on a vaccine and im confident that more than one will become a reality
by removing this question from the table it allows me to focus on the fundamentals of stocks bonds mutual funds and other investments
in about  days i will be releasing my views on the second half of  as most know i write a report for the first half of the year and the second report comes out in july while these are not predictions they are a researchbased overview of what is impacting the market during the first half of the year and how it will impact the second half
i have spoken to some investors during the shutdown of the state and they have not looked at their own investments some take the position that everything is done and when the market recovers so will their portfolio
this could never be more wrong by making some subtle changes to a portfolio during this time could have a significant change in a portfolio imagine selling one or two investments that have decline and picking up two or three new positions that are up since march by greater than  it would have a positive impact
i would not be surprised by an investor making some dramatic moves during the lows and finding out that their portfolio is up  or  ytd
we handle k plans in our office for local businesses and when i hear nonclient employees talk about their k becoming a k i get concerned since none of our client k accounts had such declines
once again if you are an employer use this time to review your kb plans and check the expense fees being assessed and the investments in your plan
many times i will hear an employer say my fees are not that high i then review what the employees are paying and its  to  yearly
second they purchased a cookiecutter plan not knowing whether those are topperforming funds or not
personally i want to hear from more than the company or its agent telling me they have all top funds i would rather do some research and then by doing a comparison among all mutual funds in that category make that claim
our current rally should continue on the data that i am seeing but as we approach july i believe i will have a better understanding of what is potentially ahead for the rest of the year
i hope everyone has a great week and continues to stay safe
if you have a question about your kb or your investments in general our first consultion is free and there is noobligation on the part of the investor

"today the public discussion national strategy for human rights  achievements challenges and next steps initiated by the ministry of justice of ukraine was attended by more than  government officials experts from ngos in the field of human rights and international organizations
i would like to note that regarding the information provided by the ministry of justice of ukraine the implementation of the strategy for  is about  percent and according to the information and analysis of the ukrainian helsinki human rights union the implementation is only  percent
however to say that someone is guilty of low performance would not be entirely appropriate based on the  assessment of the implementation of the national strategy for human rights which contains  points to consider when developing amendments to the national strategy and the relevant action plan implementation
in my speech i pointed out that the possibility of proper implementation of the national strategy for human rights is possible only in cooperation with all state institutions and joint efforts of all branches of government legislative executive and judicial however in addition to cooperation it is necessary to organize proper control over the further implementation of the strategy creating specific indicators the achievement of which can be clearly defined as success
we must not forget about the new challenges that covid has brought to our lives therefore we need to be more flexible in the implementation of any plans because life is full of surprises and the state must respond to them quickly maintaining a balance of protection of human rights at the appropriate high level
i also did not forget to mention the need to strengthen the role of the verkhovna rada commissioner for human rights for which the relevant bill  was initiated
he also answered the following questions
on the gender and difficulties of advocacy of this term in ukrainian society on the example of the bill  on strengthening the responsibility for crimes committed on the grounds of hatred
about the protection of digital rights through the protection of personal data and the implementation of the gdpr in national legislation and the establishment of a new institution of the commissioner for personal data protection which will be endowed with appropriate administrative functions to exercise proper control over privacy including digital rights",1

this is a disclaimer that this ad is by tariq albazzaz administrator of this page immigration dilemma torn families the wall and no illegal human racist and bigot is definitely thrown around a lot today videos of white nationalists or crimes against minorities are shown in the news and on social media frequently news reports of children torn from parents have been catching headlines people talk about how ridiculous the idea of a border wall is and some  are suggesting that no human being is illegal ie anyone should be able to come and have the opportunity to live in america and enjoy it as any citizen would suggesting migration controls tends to bring up the words starting this article and one underlying theme seems to be that the current president has caused undercover racism to come out into the open and even created racism among people where there once was little to none after all its suggested that the united states has always welcomed immigrants in a white house press briefing the cnn reporter jim acosta spoke about the statue of liberty and how inscribed on it are the words give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free it definitely sounds inspiring so lets take a look at the immigration policies of the united states in the past how governments debate create and enforce immigration laws and a generally more detailed picture of what is being discussed go to new york and you can see people of all colors with many different languages being spoken i remember as a child being taught in a school textbook that new york was considered the melting pot of the us we learned about how immigrants came to ellis island from europe and contributed to the country that we know today what wasnt in the textbook was the fact that immigration policy at the time was actually much less open and was much more strict than today explicitly excluding many asian immigrants while being more open to those viewed as more similar in culture and skin tone  the europeans if you really think about it this shouldnt be very surprising if american society discriminated and discriminates today against those of african descent why not others in fact even those white europeans faced discrimination and there were calls for more controls on immigration to the us as more immigrants came in  the emergency quota act was put into law which explicitly restricted the annual number of immigrants from any one country to  of the total from that country counted in the us census of  then in  a stricter law was enacted lowering that  to  and only allowing that percentage from the lower number in the us census of  that doesnt sound like we were so willing to take in all those huddled masses as jim acosta said obviously this has come up before and nothing seriously suggested today by the white house or congress comes close to explicitly restricting immigration as was done during the time we had started to supposedly become such a melting pot and bastien of open borders and people of many colors and cultures beyond those schoolbook lies the reality of immigration and how countries control flows of people became more apparent to me over the years i remember hearing of illegal immigrants working in the crop fields of my small hometown in georgia when i was still in elementary school at the time i had just moved to rural georgia from the washington dc area where i had spent the prior years i have visual memories of seeing hispanic workers in the hot sunbaked fields picking cabbage and other crops and of them coming in old schoolbuses to the local walmart shopping supercenter to buy groceries and other necessities one day i remember they formed a line in the parking lot and at the front of the line was a towel laid on the pavement with loaves of bread and packs of what looked like bologna a couple people put the sandwiches together handed them to the person at the front of the line and the next person came forward to get their sandwich their clothes were tattered and i dont remember hearing them speak english it was common knowledge that they worked very hard and accepted low wages for that pay for farmers and contractors it was a winwin more labor for less money when i worked at a beef manufacturing plant when i was  the next station on the factory line was all staffed by mexican immigrants they couldnt speak english but we became good friends joked and helped each other make the day go by faster i even learned a little spanish mostly bad words my hometown in georgia also had immigrants from india who owned many or most of the gas stations in the town after moving to ny several years later i began to be exposed to more immigrants now from all over the world my own father came from baghdad iraq in  to the united states but it was when i moved to japan that i became much more directly aware and involved with immigration before then i didnt know much about what a visa was but now i knew that a visa was a temporary permit for residency given to you by the country as an immigrant i remembered asian friends in ny telling me about their difficulties in getting visas for work in the us now that i had to get a visa myself i learned a visa would dictate what you had been granted temporary residency for work school marriage to a citizen etc it also stated the period of time the permit was valid  for a period of months years or indefinitely now it was clear to me that nations controlled who came and went into their country you are told what you are allowed to do under that arrangement such as work in specific jobs and how long you are allowed to stay in parliaments across europe in congress in the us worldwide this is something that is discussed and debated among all political parties with clear rules and limits put into place in fact this comes full circle to a fact the news almost always fails to ensure the public is reminded we have immigration controls and so do all other nations you cannot simply go to another country and decide you will now live there in fact in many you cannot even visit without applying directly to the immigration bureau of that country it is a crucial role of a government to control its borders and the flow of people through it imagine if the us simply let anyone into the country the policy would be if you can get here you can stay and work and would be granted all the rights of domestic citizens people would flood into the country from other nations probably mostly poorer nations because they would want to take the opportunity to show that they can work hard and are hungry to make a better life for themselves housing costs would likely go up wages would likely go down  it would probably not work very well for the prior domestic residents if youve stayed up late at night youve probably seen the commercials where for only a penny a day you can sponsor a poor child in a poor country this is a sad reality  its been said that half of the worlds population lives on less than  per day the amount of struggling poor around the globe is much much larger than the number of people in the us the idea of a union of countries with blanket access and free movement of people to live and work is something that has been done right now the european union is comprised of  countries with this free movement policy called the schengen area one key distinction must be made these  are not the most impoverished nations in the world so the free movement of people from for example subsaharan africa does not come under the terms of this agreement however the eu has allowed many refugees from syria or africa to settle in the region this has created huge debate and controversy with political parties promoting less immigration garnering more support and winning elections in hungary and slovenia this has become a reality against the will of the governing body of the eu those nations have installed border fences and walls to prevent those from coming into their countries spain has also done the same italy has had immigration at the forefront of its recent elections apparently the notion of a border barrier such as a wall is not out of the ordinary one big event came in  which is very similar and related to the immigration debate put forth in donald trumps campaign in june of that year the citizens of the united kingdom voted to leave the eu many analysts and research suggested the single largest issue for citizens and the vote out was the policy of open borders to anyone from this immigration union of  nations clearly the issue of immigration is not confined to the united states  this has become a global issue in spite of the fact that construction at the border is going on around the world the idea that the government construct a wall on our border is portrayed as ridiculous by many news organizations the uks vote to leave the eu seemed to stem from legal immigration however in the us illegal immigration tends to get much more media attention so how do immigrants become illegal in the us the two most prevalent ways are crossing the border without going through a checkpoint such as in the desert or through a tunnel or being issued a visa granted for a set period but then staying inside the country beyond that allowed period going from legal resident to illegal resident in  there were approximately  border arrests from people doing this the number of people successful is less clear and is estimated to be anywhere from  to  another way people gain access is by claiming asylum although the numbers of people doing so is far less to attain refugee status after claiming asylum an individual must prove they fit the following criteria an individual must have suffered persecution or fear suffering persecution because of race religion nationality political opinion or membership in a particular social group what is often left out is the attitude towards immigrants and asylees in mexico mexico deports many who try to enter their own borders a report this year from amnesty international found that  of immigrants were not informed of their right to seek asylum even though it is required by mexican law the country also deported more immigrants per capita than the united states only  of mexicos population is foreign whereas the uss number is around  its even stated in mexican law that the country may deny entry to anyone in order to maintain its demographic balance mexico also much more easily grants visas to those from wealthier countries at the same time the government has published literature in the past advising illegal immigrants in the united states on how to avoid us immigration officials for a country that chastises the administration for the idea of a border wall this all sounds hypocritical there is also the issue of children being held in detention centers in the us the news media makes it seem as if this began since the election however this has been publicized and ongoing under past administrations such as the obama administration under which the record number of deportations occurred additionally the government tries to release most children to sponsors such as family while this is definitely something the government should address framing seems to be more popular than discussing realities the facts on immigration never seem to be laid bare in mainstream news articles if this has been ongoing with child detainees why hasnt this been addressed before what should the government do to more fairly accommodate those detained who illegally reside in the us while also deterring illegal immigration discussions shouldnt always include racist remarks of drug dealers or rapists  many simply want to live a better life however it also shouldnt include racist or bigot for suggesting that a line be drawn  there has always been a line drawn for all countries,1

will have all the details and more history will have the mueller report in its full unredacted sweetness history will know every step along the way from his campaigns first contact with the russian spies right up to him freely quoting the stolen emails on the campaign stage history will even have his tax returns how is that even fair but as much as history will have all the info at this point we really arent missing that much does each and every dot along the way need to be fully penciled in before we admit the obvious line between that first meeting and the knowing use of russianhacked documents on the campaign trail at this point does anyone think he is keeping his tax returns hidden out of a sense of humility in time every detail will be documented but right here right now we are already well past the reasonable doubt stage the right side of history train is blowing its final boarding call whistle allaboard and despite the purposefully crafted fears to the otherwise no hate

after the inauguration to start handing out tens of thousands of kind heart pins and embrace hope stickers the same forces of unlimited political spending that brought all this to the nation in  first started a trial version in our home state of wisconsin in  we were targeted for our outstanding public schools and universities and also for our leadership in environmental protection what theyve done hasnt been pretty but along the way weve learned a few things here is wisconsin it began with whats best described as a blitzkrieg attack on our states teachers it was well planned well funded and it was all about breaking the teachers spirits for a while it worked the inhumanity of using their media to turn teachers into villains in the eyes of the people of wisconsin simply to reward the governors benefactors with tax cuts was too much for us the center of the attack was the states largest school district here in milwaukee the first inservice day of back to school that fall we had a newlycreated teach gift box on every teachers and support staffs desk  in total in it along with two spices were a teachers care bumper sticker a teach pin and a page teach mini cook booklet somehow it helped ive had mps teachers tell me it had gotten to the point where they did not want to go out in public for fear of being asked what they did for a living with all the right wing hate being directed at them am radio talkers really are like cancer to everything good in our area and as much as this opened our eyes to the power of pins and as good as the spices were and i still see the original teachers care bumper stickers ultimately it was the booklet that turned the tide in the face of the inhumanity being directed at the teachers by simply showing the humanity of teachers and their kindness the bubble of hate towards them burst it was an eyeopener so we were ready for the womens march january   i dont know if any of us understand just how much every american owes to those who participated in the womens march all the damage done here in wisconsin everything we are still trying to dig out from was accomplished because they had us convinced they were popular and had the will of the people the outpouring of humanity that was the womens march dwarfed the inauguration crowds the previous day he lied so hard about that because he needed it to set in motion all he wanted to do but the myth of popular support never left the ground the history books should teach  like dday  its that important so its two years later and thanks to everyone who marched on january  and everyone whos pitched in since hope is still alive and thats a reason to celebrate stop into our store for your hope and kindness box and if you havent already jump on the right side of history train

"money money money
it is not the title of the song with which betty curtis revolutionized music in the s but it is what in italy now everyone is asking due to the economic crisis triggered by the coronavirus
as is well known fca atlantia arcelor mittal and others asked for money from the street vendor to the small shopkeeper and gradually up to the big industry
what is disconcerting however is that they are asking for figures from many zeros including companies and individuals who in previous years declared derisory revenues to the tax authorities
the government has already approved and allocated  billion euros of new debts which will fall on the heads of our children because sooner or later they will have to be paid and there are those who expect hundreds of billions to rain from europe even if they were sweets which if they come will be by way of loans with heavy conditionality and in any case there is the sinister feeling that they would not be enough even if they were  billion euros
i remind you that today is  billion is equivalent to  thousand billion of the old lire and therefore in the interest of the nation since we are talking about large figures i would like to suggest that the government be very careful to distribute this enormous wealth without responding to logic patronage or worse still political and party squandering this great opportunity for economic recovery
but rather to exploit it to strengthen our agricultural commercial industrial activities requiring above all certain guarantees on the use of these resources finalizing them to the restructuring improvement innovation and modernization of companies with the possibility of control by inspectors state and with the commitment not to fire and not to close the business except for proven reasons
maintaining employment levels in the first place

"infected and happy oliynyk and bondarenko hid information about covid infection
this was announced at a press conference by the head of the state institution dnipropetrovsk regional laboratory center of the ministry of health of ukraine oleksandr shtepa
on may  the disaster medicine team delivered  blood samples marked vip and vip to our laboratory i cannot disclose the personal data of patients but i think it will not be difficult for you to guess whose samples they were double testing on the evening of may  we learned the result a vip patient infected with coronavirus we reported to the relevant services
after that the dnipropetrovsk regional council and the regional administration began to compile lists of contact persons information about this became the property of the media
over the next day we were asked to check the data several more times said oleksandr shtepa head of the laboratory center samples of socalled contact patients also began to arrive
a total of  employees of the regional council and dnipro regional state administration were inspected of which  showed a positive or questionable result medical practice shows that a doubtful result actually means the presence of infection and patients need to be observed
the leaders of the region frightened by the received data tried to avoid publicity beginning on may  accusations and threats were made against the staff of the laboratory center then the work of the institution was paralyzed by inspections and then regional officials disseminated inaccurate information about the dismissal of the head of the center
in order to clarify oleksandr shtepa personally delivered the samples for testing to the basic reference laboratory in kyiv which is the only one in ukraine accredited to conduct pcr tests on covid
independent state examination the data of which are recorded in the protocols confirmed the full correctness of the experts of the dnipropetrovsk regional laboratory center
in the evening of may  following the rules of transportation i delivered samples of vip and contact persons to the basic reference laboratory in kyiv said oleksandr shtepa
by the evening of may  the reference laboratory officially confirmed our data and established  cases of infection and several other socalled suspicious
the head of the dnipropetrovsk regional laboratory center calls for an end to attacks by regional officials on the institution and to protect professionals who work in incredible conditions to protect human health
you can fully trust the results of our tests because we are well aware of our responsibilities we have worked work and will work  hours a day for people for their safety said the head of the laboratory center alexander shtepa",1

"your job is at risk join a union
solidarity has predicted that job cuts will increase dramatically in the wake of the covid crisis many firms who have taken advantage of the government furlough scheme are now making workers redundant many sectors have already seen widespread redundancies with unions warning thousands more jobs could be wiped out the government is plan to pay  of wages for staff kept on by employers came too late for many they had already been laidoff
now we see a fresh wave of redundancies research by the institute for social and economic research at the university of essex has warned  million jobs could be lost this would equate to about a quarter of the uk is total jobs with more than half of the positions in certain sectors being lost
unemployment increased by  to  million amounting to  percent in the three months to march
patrick harrington general secretary of solidarity said it is clear that we are heading toward a period of large scale job losses make no mistake your job is at risk our union has seen an increase in illfounded disciplinary actions fake redundancies redundancies and misuse of poor performance procedures weve also seen probationary workers or workers under two years service the time you need to be employed generally before being able to make an employment tribunal claim summarily dismissed
im pleased to say weve been able to block such moves against our members or gain financial settlements in many cases if you are not a member of a union at this time you should join being a union member means you will get guidance representation and support in the troubled times ahead joining a union is a no brainer id like you to join our union but joining any union is a good move

im grateful to robert f kennedy jr jenny mccarthy mark blaxill dr paul thomas dr chris exley and jennifer margulis phd all of whom have provided reviews of my book included below the book remains at  in the autismasperger is category because of the choice of so many of you to preorder the book which will be released on september th thank you for your support and if you have not preordered i hope you consider doing so jb handley is arguably the  worlds most thoughtful sophisticated knowledgeable and indefatigable activist for childrens health and safety as a frontline leader for fifteen years handley has led the big fistfight against the pharma cartel to force the issue broadcast the science and expose the lies behind the vaccine policies that have created an epidemic of chronic disease among our children handley has helped bring the issue of toxins in medical products and regulatory corruption to a tipping point handleys advocacy has lifted the curtain of lies behind which the autism epidemic has sprouted when we end this cataclysm it will be thanks to the dogged character of people like jb handley who have refused to rest in his battle to support parents protect children bring justice to injured families and to punish those responsible for one of the worst scandals in american history please read this book and decide for yourself if you still believe that vaccines are safe and effective robert f kennedy jr i honestly believe jb handley wrote the book that will end the autism epidemic as i sit here now in stillness i want to jump up and down with excitement but im holding back rivers of tears he breaks down the scientific information in a way that doesnt intimidate the reader and he lets us know its okay to be angry his soul his fight his love for his son radiates off the pages wow bravo bravo jenny mccarthy author of louder than words coauthor of healing and preventing autism this book is inspired powerful the unadulterated truth and a must read we have sacrificed too many children at the vaccine altar while our blind belief in the cdc and aap government and the media has prevented us from seeing the conflicts of interest that enable big business and big pharma to profit at the expense of our childrens health how to end the autism epidemic is one familys story but it is sadly also a story shared by millions of families a beautiful normal baby vaccinated and then lost to autism and all the horrible medical conditions associated with immune devastation and brain toxicity thank you jb for sharing your story and wisdom parents and future parents read this book now and say no to business as usual and the status quo if your pediatrician has not yet done his or her own research and is just parroting the vaccines are safe and effective marketing phrase it is time for you to get a new pediatrician paul thomas md coauthor of the vaccinefriendly plan and the addiction spectrum as parents our job is to be concerned about our childrens health yet every day in doctors offices around the country american parents are told we are being irresponsible or selfish just for asking questions about vaccines we all want to keep our children safe and healthy both from infectious diseases and from overexposure to toxins its reasonable to be concerned that there are too many vaccines on the schedule and that medications like antibiotics acetaminophen and adhd drugs are being overprescribed whats a worried parent to do for starters read this book sharing his personal story as the father of a boy with autism and taking a close look at the most recent and rigorous science stanfordeducated jb handley shows how the cdcs aggressive childhood vaccine schedule is connected to the astonishing rise in autism in the united states how to end the autism epidemic is a direct challenge to the american public health establishment and a gift to the millions of parents who find themselves caught in the crosshairsuncertain of what to think or doof the seemingly intractable debate about vaccines jennifer margulis phd author of your baby your way coauthor of the vaccinefriendly plan i have been thinking about the toxicity of aluminum for thirtyfive years it is my lifes work before we completed our recent research on aluminum in brain tissue in autism i could not see a direct link between human exposure to aluminum and autism i certainly saw no immediate role for aluminum adjuvants in vaccines in autism the missing link was a mechanism whereby the brain would be subjected to an acute exposure to aluminum for example as occurs in aluminuminduced dialysis encephalopathy proinflammatory cells some originating from blood and lymph heavily loaded with a cargo of aluminum in brain tissue in autism provided that missing link we all tolerate the toxicity of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines unfortunately some of us are predisposed to suffer as opposed to tolerate the toxicity of aluminum adjuvants and this may cause autism autism is a disease and it is not inevitable jb handleys elegant synthesis of what we know and what we need to know argues that autism could and should be preventable i agree with him professor christopher exley phd fellow royal society of biology professor of bioinorganic chemistry keele university jb handley tells it like it is his new book is a masterful synthesis of all the latest threads of autism the controversies the science the legal and policy battles and the human dimension of the movement that has inspired so many of us to become parent activists peppered with jawdropping new developmentsincluding depositions from major vaccine science luminarieshandley weaves a compelling narrative and cuts through the noise to make a powerful and convincing case read it

business tax ballot measures  this elections two sides of the progressive coin heads  the very hopeful story of proposition c universal childcare in san francisco tails  the sad story of proposition d affordable housing for all despite a  million yes on d campaign on election day prop d went down in humiliating to defeat  not even winning a simple majority let alone its necessary  vote but proposition c has won a close  vote victory   to  disclosure todco strongly endorsed and provided  in support to the proposition c universal childcare in san francisco campaign the setup proposition d was put on the june ballot on january th by five members of the board of supervisors it proposed to impose a new gross receipts tax of  on revenues a business receives from leasing some commercial spaces in san francisco to fund homeless services housing for extremely lowtomiddleincome households and for other public purposes the city controller estimated it would generate approximately  million per year for such programs because it was placed on the ballot by the supervisors due to proposition  rules proposition d required approval by  of city voters to go into effect the backstory is that proposition d was quickly drafted and brought forward in the weeks following mayor ed lees sudden death with the cooperation of the staff of the new acting mayor there had been no discussion at all of such a housingfunding june ballot measure before this and prop d featured prominently as one plank in the campaign of one candidate for mayor in the june election who was endorsed by all its sponsors the second factor in this election scenario was the competing proposition c ballot universal childcare measure that would increase the same city business taxes at a higher rate   to fund quality early care and education for young children and for other public purposes the city controller estimated it would generate approximately  million per year for such programs this ballot measure had been developed and drafted in the second half of  by a broad citywide coalition of childcare service providers and advocacy groups it was put on the ballot by it proponents collecting  registered voter signatures which also means that it potentially required only a simple majority of voter approval to go into effect this legal issue has not yet been finally resolved by the state supreme court because they both proposed to increase the same tax whichever one of these measures secured the most votes  provided that prop d got its required  vote to start with  would be the one that went into effect  the other would be void prop c featured prominently as one plank in the campaign of another candidate for mayor in the june election who had worked closely with this community coalition from the start plainly both measures proposed a very progressive funding source increased city businesses taxes to achieve vital community and civic goals  more affordable housing or greatly expanded affordable childcare  that would directly benefit lowerandmiddleincome san francisco households but only one could win at best and both were part of the mayors race too  prop d very intentionally so the community conflict children vs housing was an instant wedge issue for the citys politically active progressive community constituencies prop c advocates were understandably unhappy even angered about the sudden appearance of a competing ballot measure at the last minute that was so clearly connected to the unexpected june mayors race this included a wide range of community organizations across the city of many types engaged or concerned with family and education services other activists felt that the longtime affordable housing issue a mainstay of san francisco progressive politics and a generally popular political cause was being opportunistically rippedoff for other transparent political purposes prop ds community advocates did not directly address these reactions publicly core support came from several  but not all  of the citys nonprofit affordable housing developers and their networks that stood to gain directly from prop d new funding this included the megascale multistate nonprofits like mercy housing and bridge housing local communitybased groups like chinatown cdc tenderloin ndc and mission housing development corp and their forprofit construction and management companies like nibbi bros and the john stewart co in private some prop d advocates offered a realpolitik assurance dont worry prop d cant get a  vote anyway so it wont ever block prop c and all prop c needs is  to pass as a compromise a number of groups endorsed both measures despite the selfevident logical inconsistency of this position the overall outcome of these community dynamics was a significant estrangement among the two measures supporters prop ds campaign received little community support outside the networks of its core beneficiaries and political sponsors prop c had a significantly broader community base thanks to its inclusive communitydriven development and initiation downtown opposition to props c and d there was no division among the citys business constituencies  business tax increases are bad vote no on both c and d lead by sf boma the building owners and managers association and with the financial support of the chamber of commerces san francisco forward pac various business associations and dozens of downtown property owners the committee for an affordable san francisco no on propositions c and d has so far spent at least  to defeat both measures this mainly funded mailers and many tv ads prop c alone was especially targeted due to its greater likelihood of passing with just a  vote the oppositions general theme acknowledged the worthiness of affordable housing and childcare but objected to taxing business interests alone for this as unfair andor economically counterproductive predictably the san francisco chronicle and business times both supported this view few if any community groups formally opposed either prop c or prop d political endorsements followed the political alliances of each measures sponsors on the board of supervisors the yes on prop c campaign prop cs supporters raised at least  for the yes on c campaign funding some mailers and extensive social media ads in addition to todco the principal funders included the seiu the campaign also coordinated to a degree with other progressive ballot measure campaigns like yes on f the campaigns general theme emphasized the three components of the measure  immediate lowincome child care center waiting list slots for  children future middleincome family subsidies and increased wages for child careeducation workers the yes on prop d campaign prop ds supporters raised over  for the yes on d campaign how it was used is not evident the campaigns general theme focused on the crucial need for affordable housing and homeless housing in san francisco the principle funders include two longtime political establishment pacs the committee on jobs and progress san francisco as well as many politicallyconnected developers interestingly kaiser permanent contributed  presumably as part of its new regional affordable housing program even facebook corp chipped in  several nonprofit housing developers added a total of  and the sf police officers association added  the voters judgment on june th election day downtowns sophisticated and wellfunded no and c and d campaign was certainly very effective proposition d was absolutely crushed failing to achieve even a simple  majority vote and with just  approval against a  no vote  short of its required  approval vote after a weeks counting of late ballots proposition c has won by about  votes lessons to learn this hard way  a divided community cant beat downtown because they were in direct competition with each other neither prop c nor prop d had universal community support if the community resources that were devoted to prop d had instead been combined in support of broadbased prop c then prop c would have won by a substantial margin despite the onslaught of downtown s against it but the topdown last minute prop d never stood a chance  it can take a mayors committed leadership to win revenue ballot measures especially  votes simply appealing to holy issues like affordablehomeless housing or child careeducation is not enough no bond or special tax measure needing  voter approval has ever passed without strong political support from the mayors office as interim mayor mark farrell had no real political capital to give prop d and mayoral support dramatically increases the chances for majorityapproval tax measures if the state supreme court rules this is a valid option for future voterinitiative tax measures this will be a crucial leadership opportunity for the citys new mayor  prop ds community supporters were played for fools given these two hard allthetime realities there was never any realistic hope at all of getting a  vote for prop d in the current circumstances especially while having a divisive mayors race at the same time too the cynical political strategy of at least some of prop ds initiators to use it as a wedge issue to divide progressive community resources and thereby defeat the very  from their point of view  politically dangerous likelytowin prop c may well have worked and prop ds community supporters have nothing positive to take from their humiliating  showing and wasted resources their willingness to fall for this sucker bait was astonishing in its naivet������ and the broken community trusts it leaves behind may prove hard to heal  downtown can be beat prop cs victory without mayoral and establishment support and against strong opposition shows the path to winning progressive ballot measures  even sizeable new downtown taxes it appealed not to just the left but to all san francisco constituencies concerned with the future of children and families in the city it proposed to financially assist not just lowerincome households but middleincome families too and it mobilized a diverse community network that does not usually engage in electoral contests the citys child care and educational providers and their many members this is an important victory john elberling president todco

more than half a century ago dr martin luther king gave this speech about a riot it seems like such a distant past we have made a lot of progress but there is no question that some of those who we have entrusted to enforce the law believe they are the law in a nation built on law and order no one can be above the law congress must act now by enacting federal legislation to regulate police departments nationwide national standards not only banning certain conduct  like lethal headlocks and knees on necks but ensuring that violations are met with immediate termination pension revocation and mandatory minimum sentencing for their use every day honest police officers nationwide protect their communities with the utmost respect for everyone but there are bad apples that must be held accountable the days of turning a blind eye and keeping silent are over if a badge abuser is violating their oath to uphold the law they are not officers of the law they are criminals and we have a moral and legal duty to ensure they are held accountable for their crime,1

my teacher lives in a story house not including the basement and up the street are condominiums in one of the condo apartments live a family with children one day my teacher is wife goes into their basement to do laundry and lo and behold she smells dirty diapers i guess dirty diapers have a distinct smell she recognized immediately that this isnt normal and called my teacher explaining that it smells like dirty diapers their kids are all grown up so obviously it w  asnt coming from them my teacher thought about it and speculated someone up the street was flushing dirty diapers down their toilet he said to his wife dont flush the toilet dont use the washer dont use the sink he proceeds to call the company that put in the sewer system of his house he is friends with the companys contact and this person was happy to help out my teacher what the guy told him to do was plug every drain in the house with a oneway drain trap apparently these contraptions are sold at home improvement stores specifically for this kind of reason my teacher even detached his toilets to plug those drains with the traps  on every toilet in the house  except on the rd floor wait for it once my teacher did that according to his friend is instructions he was to go to the rd floor and flush every toilet my teacher explained that when he did this it was so clogged up in the pipes water started coming up from the drain of his bathroom and he had to plug it up nothing was happening until he just heard this giant whoosh noise in his pipes not long after fire trucks were scrambling to the condos up the street and he knew the plan worked the plan to block the neighbor is pipes right back how did this happen since my teachers silly neighbors were in fact flushing diapers down the toilet the way the sewer system operates is based on elevation the flow goes downstream so coming from the condos up the street the flow came off at an intersection and went to his house hence the dirty diaper smell the diapers were caught at an intersection and actually going into his house so by plugging all of the drains except the rd floor the pipe water would need more pressure to travel up to the rd floor or by flushing all of the toilets and introducing a lot of pressure into the system because its at a higher elevation on the rd floor blocking everything shot all of the clogged up sewage back upstream even though its going upstream remember  pressure  all of his drains were plugged including the sewage system going down the street so theres only one way to go to the neighbors and into their house thats why you dont flush diapers down the toilet they expand actually dont flush anything other than what should go down there,1

"slovak legislative pearl
the highest constitutional trio of government parliament and president broke through yesterday is implementation of the confusing law no  zz the absolute bottom of our existing legislative basement
when on  may  the national council of the slovak republic approved by  votes out of  deputies present a government bill amending act no  coll on health care providers print  the judge expected the president is office to return this mess of concepts a mess of nonsense and legislative tricks to parliament for reworking
after all in the civilized world healthcare is strictly specialized also for the sake of transparency and clarity for the public if a patient goes to a rheumatology clinic he knows that he will find a rheumatologist there in a diabetologist is outpatient clinic in the surgical surgeon in oncological oncologist urological urologist etc
not in slovakia anymore our new lordship by law no  zz established the socalled epidemiological ambulances where instead of a suitably educated physician a specialist epidemiologist meeting the conditions of government regulation no  coll of  december  has to treat a patient with suspicion of covid and at the same time other health problems a doctor with one of the  other specializations selected by the lords eg an endocrinologist nephrologist or a doctor of nuclear medicine a doctor of occupational medicine or an immunoallergologist etc
however the specialist specialist with the focus stated in the name of the outpatient clinic epidemiologist in matovicovsko kollarovsko caputovskom slovensko has nothing to do in epidemiological ambulance according to the approved law
perhaps if the creators of the law even the abovementioned heads crossed did not confuse the terms and understand the differences in terms epidemiology epidemiology and epidemy they would avoid stupid formulations not only in the text of the law but often in their own public appearances
when the chief hygienist talks about the introduction of antiepidemic measures he talks about measures to suppress and eliminate epidemy which naturally makes sense
on the other hand if we hear the prime minister the minister of health but also other constitutional officials or editors and moderators passionately talk about the introduction of antiepidemiological measures we see that in their simplicity they have no idea how publicly they complain about incompetent harassment of measures against epidemiolgom people whose help and expertise we rely on today
therefore if someone wanted to emphasize in the law the special position of some specialized clinics in relation to patients affected by covid it was appropriate legally correct and clean to use the primary designation of the clinic according to the specialization of the operating doctor with the adjective epidemic such as geriatricepulanic and not the misleading term epidemiological outpatient clinic
but let is move from terminology to the merits in the context of the fact that in times of emergency it is possible to impose on all health professionals including specialized clinics the obligation to perform health care even in relation to patients with covid it is absolutely incomprehensible why the government in acute difficult financial situations even sets up such an exclusive network of specialized workplaces comprising  medical specializations shrouded in a kind of epidemiological ambulances
ambulances supported by an incredibly generous and unusual flatrate lump sum payment albeit for only one single epidemic patient in the amount of up to eur  per month per ambulance
if we know from the current hospital practice in the examination of hundreds of pandemic patients the price for the necessary onetime personal protective equipment ppe per health worker also with a reserve at about  eur then the monthly lump sum of  eur begins to appear as a gold mine for the chosen and incredible waste of government with taxpayers money for an absolutely obscure purpose any increased costs disinfection ppe should be reimbursed according to the number of epidemiologically risky procedures performed stealing in healthcare is disgusting and obscene
slowly every day we learn from the media about new billions of loans at the expense of our state and we watch helplessly as the new government throws them into all sorts of nonsense in addition it creates chaos in society indebts us and our children and devastates the economic foundations of the hitherto successfully developing slovak republic through constant persecution or restrictions therefore it seems to us that we have no choice but to join forces consolidate professional capacities and put a meaningful alternative on our feet to the strange suite of political clowns and adventurers who inadvertently seized the government over slovakia",1

"mayor is live update may  
topics horton farmer is market southwestern public health road construction city shelter city housing transit city cooling centre
there was no council tonight as per their usual schedule
joe preston mayor stthomas ontario spoke to the vote last week by council to deny the plan put forward by the market board for the opening of the horton farmers market council voted  against it st thomas city councillors steve peters jim herbert steve wookey and lori baldwinsands who is the chair of the market baord voted for the letter of support gary clarke mark tinlin joan rymal mayor joe preston and jeff kohler who is also on the market board voted against it
mayor preston says that during the discussion questions asked by himself and the councillors were not answered to a satisfactory level to allow the market to open the market opening is not completely off the table however if at least two of the councillors have a change of heart they can put it forward to council for reconsideration which would take it to another vote
this topic has been hot this week generating lots of feedback suggestions and opinions about this decision if you have suggestions about how the market could open safely it seems the best place to reach out to is the horton farmers market board the market board has a meeting on wednesday evening of this week
southwestern public health is continuing to inform mayor preston and the city of st thomas mayor preston is the vice chair of the local health board according to the latest statistics ontario has seen a bump in the numbers of covid cases over the last four or five days perhaps lining up with mother is day two weeks ago mayor preston says it is important to listen to the experts like southwestern public health as of tuesday may th st thomas has zero cases and elgin county has one case of covid
all of the road construction in st thomas is back in action the construction on the roads had a head start to the season because of our early tenders
the mayor had a tour of the takumi plant in st thomas and shares the good example they provide for how a workplace can put safety measures in place to get their business back up and running
council continues to talk about housing advantages in the community the space above the transit building is still in discussion for affordable housing mayor joe notes that this year st thomas has a yearround shelter inn out of the cold stthomaselgin where we did not last year along with affordable housing mayor joe believes that housing supports are important
transit the city is working towards improving transit this looks like expanded hours new equipment and access seven days a week
 talbot street is the old ontario works building and is the current resting spot for st thomas as well as the cooling centre if the city needs to expand the space due to meeting capacity they will find another spot quickly

"every one of the democratic candidates remaining would make a better president than donald trump but the race for the democratic nomination is a fractured one it is not a straightforward narrative captured by glancing at a map and the process wont be decided by the simple horse race numbers in clickbait headlines that is never been our focus our focus is on building a broad coalition to win delegates everywhere
for months elizabeth has been near or at the top of the list of candidates that voters are considering for president according to the latest economistyougov poll  of voters across all age groups are considering voting for warren including  of selfdescribed liberals and  of selfdescribed moderates elizabeth is best positioned to unite the party and lead the democratic ticket to defeat donald trump
our campaign is no stranger to being written off or counted out early but here is what we do know elizabeth has proven the doubters wrong before
elizabeth is progressive effective and has lived a life that has prepared her for this fight with a strong organization of more than  staff on the ground in  states bolstered by a movement of more than  grassroots donors we are confident that as americans continue to get to know elizabeth theyll see what we see every day elizabeth is the only candidate who can unite the party and defeat donald trump in november
but the only way well win this nomination is if everyone reading this digs deep and funds our  grassrootsfunded campaign can you help us keep moving forward chip in   or whatever you can to power this movement through the critical races to come",1

"merkel is dictation
democracy is closed
what is going on in germany the chancellor refuses to discuss this at state level she is not in the mood for discussions you say snotty
the chancellor is activities are drifting more and more into a dictate of omnipotence and its specifications this behavior is not worthy of the office because it is more reminiscent of the sandbox games of a fiveyearold or just the role models from the old days of the gdr the chancellor orders the federal states to more or less follow their draft resolutions demands a uniform approach and action under her direction although there are very large regional differences and needs
what do we have in germany now monarchy dictatorship no we elected this sed miracle girl from the past to the highest office in the republic queen merkel has ruled over the obedient majority for almost  years and is well on her way to hypnotically throwing everyone under the plates
the real question is when is enough
we are kept in check for weeks with false reports from the virologist droste schools are closed childcare services withdrawn although the results have been different for weeks
accusesvirologistsoffalsestudyontheviralloadofchildren 
they decided to stigmatize us by considering the necessary acceptance for dictatorial features as meaningful it has come to this in this country democracy is only on the packaging the pandemic has paved the way to omnipotence
the regulatory authorities are used against us for the purpose of complying with and implementing alleged protective measures although we are systemically and regionally completely different from italy spain france and belgium not to mention the broken savings and nonexistent social systems like in the usa russia and china the only thing that can be recognized equally is the behavior of the government towards omnipotence and oppression
this government does not deserve a vote this government especially ms merkel acts dictatorially and beyond moral responsibility when faced with emergencies far greater collateral damage is produced than how protection is exercised on the citizen one likes to cite the example of italyalthough it lacks any systemic basis
this is no longer the country it was in  like  where you could still feel the cohesion and the cornerstones of democracy

when i first hit upon the idea to write the fever of  what fascinated me even more than the story of inoculation a daring and profound medical innovation was the way a public health emergency stresses the social and political fabric of a community epidemics and pandemics do more than infect peoplethey infect whole societies the fever in the fever of  referred in part to smallpox and in part to the madness that comes over a people under threat of serious illnes  s and possible death what were seeing now in the united states as a whole are some of the same forces that convulsed boston but writ geographically largea government so fearful of the economic consequences of epidemic that it is trying to squelch a full and honest reporting of the problem thereby threatening to make a bad situation far worse a medical establishment threatened by an overwhelming case load it is not prepared to handle frightened people desperate to assign some reason for covid be it gods vengeance or a chinese germ warfare experiment gone awol and in ways that will doubtless become more apparent as time passes people trying to exploit the crisis for profit the good news is that covid isnt smallpox which historically has killed more people than any other infectious disease and this isnt  which means the question isnt whether an immunization can stop the outbreak but rather how long an effective vaccine will take to be developed and safely deployed as in boston this outbreak already has its heroes in particular dr li wenliang the chinese doctor who defied his government to warn of the outbreak and who died a victim of the disease in february and his colleague dr mei zhongming who died of the virus just a few days ago sadly it seems likely there will be many more victims and more martyrs before this is over will there be more heroes time will tell but my prediction is that when this outbreak is oversooner i hope than laterit will have changed america in some fundamental ways whether those changes are for better or for worse is up to us,1

making a case for joe biden more than just that he polls well against donald trump and let us start off by saying that those polls should not be ignored joe biden has had a consistent edge over the other democratic candidates in headtohead polling against trump in national surveys going back to last march biden kicks trump is butt additionally biden polls much better against trump than other candidates in swing states but right now let us focus on some things that biden brings to the table in terms of the sheer number of issues biden influenced during his time in the obama administration foreign policy and fiscal issues are among many items in biden is portfolio back in  it was biden is office that primarily orchestrated the handover of iraq to the iraqis it is biden is view of afghanistan that bit by bit came to dominate thinking inside the  withdrawal plan on financial reform it was biden who prodded an indecisive obama to embrace paul volcker is idea of barring banks from risky trading according to austan goolsbee formerly the head of obama is council of economic advisers biden also tilted the discussion in favor of a bailout of the big three auto companies according to jared bernstein biden is former economic adviser i think he made a difference in president is thinking bernstein said he understood the importance of the auto companies to their communities and throughout the country thanks to his decades in the senate biden came to the job of vp with a deep understanding of the way the federal government operates which enabled him to oversee projects that spanned different agencies and different branches most importantly he was in charge of implementing the american recovery and reinvestment act recovery act which was one of the administrations great unsung successes it involved a huge amount of work and coordination and by every account biden performed exceptionally well at it just the fact that they managed to distribute over threequarters of a trillion dollars without any major scandals of graft or theft was an extraordinary accomplishment biden led the successful administration effort to gain senate approval for the new start treaty strategic arms reduction treaty this is a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the united states and the russian federation with the formal name of measures for the further reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms it was signed on april th  in prague and after ratification entered into force on february th  it is expected to last at least until  biden declared his support for marriage equality on national television in   three days before barack obama did hes been a champion of lgbtq rights and made big waves when he said its going to become a political liability in the near term for an individual to say i oppose gay marriage mark my words in a  interview with the human rights campaigns chad griffin his support for the lgbtq community continued throughout his vice presidency biden officiated a samesex wedding at the vice presidential residence in washington dc marrying two longtime white house staffers buzzfeed reported at the  state of the union address obama announced the establishment of cancer moonshot an initiative led by biden that would accelerate cancer research making more therapies available to more patients while improving our ability to prevent cancer and detect it in early stages according to the national cancer institute moonshot came almost a year after bidens son beau died of brain cancer in may of  at age  biden is  violence against women act was reauthorized in   and  the act led to further related developments in the creation of the white house council on women and girls begun in obama is first term as well as the white house task force to protect students from sexual assault begun in january  with biden as cochair along with valerie jarrett biden has a strong stance on sexual assault for example biden stated to a victim of sexual assault at stanford university you did it  in the hope that your strength might prevent this crime from happening to someone else your bravery is breathtaking he has also taken legality into the situation biden issued federal guidelines while presenting a speech at the university of new hampshire he stated that no means no if you are drunk or you are sober no means no if you are in bed in a dorm or on the street no means no even if you said yes at first and you changed your mind no means no biden was selected to head up a special task force on the issue of gun control after a school shooting at a newtown connecticut elementary school biden delivered solutions for reducing gun violence across the nation to president obama in january  he helped craft  actions that the president could take on the issue using his power of executive order among other recommendations among  presidential candidates biden has the longest legislative record on climate change he pioneered some of the earliest climate change legislation in us history his first climate change bill introduced in  did not pass in the senate but the following year a version of bidens legislation survived as an amendment to a state department funding bill president ronald reagan went on to sign it into law the upshot of bidens global climate protection act was to call on the president to set up a task force to plan how to mitigate global warming the measure also asked him to make climate change a higher priority item on the ussoviet agenda biden supports governmental funding to find new energy sources he cosponsored the sense of the senate resolution calling on the united states to be a part of the united nations climate negotiations and the boxersanders global warming pollution reduction act the most stringent climate bill in the united states senate under obama the recovery act implemented by biden made the largest single investment in clean energy in history providing more than  billion in strategic clean energy investments and tax incentives to promote job creation and the deployment of lowcarbon technologies and leveraging approximately  billion in private and other nonfederal capital for clean energy investments joe is skilled at reaching across the aisle to get things done he can sit down in foreign policy or other issues and find a common interest and drive the ideas forward look at what he did with jesse helms and strom thurmond in passing the chemical weapons treaty and crime bills respectively in the s his former chief of staff and later successor ted kaufman noted back then i mean jesse helms and strom thurmond you do not get more conservative than that let us remember biden is debate performance in  he faced his republican counterpart representative paul ryan in the lone  vice presidential debate on october th in danville kentucky there he made a feisty emotional defense of the obama administration is record and energetically attacked the republican ticket this helped the obama campaign regain momentum after obama is first lackluster debate performance biden is most important role within the obama administration was to question assumptions playing a contrarian role obama said that the best thing about joe is that when we get everybody together he really forces people to think and defend their positions to look at things from every angle and that is very valuable for me another senior obama advisor said biden is always prepared to be the skunk at the family picnic to make sure we are as intellectually honest as possible and on and on and on is joe biden a perfect human being of course not who is but is biden an intelligent man who could bring a lot of important experience and skill to the white house at a time when we desperately need to be rid of donald trump hell yes and let us once again emphasize biden polls very well against trump compared to other democratic candidates who either have far less experience are too ideologically extreme or both i say we need joe biden,1

my parents came literally from dust born in two separate small towns in the state of jalisco mexico soon after the end of the cristero war  and on the heals of the mexican revolution  they grew up in circumstances that are experienced by the poorest among the poor as a young child my mom lived on the streets for a few years under the protection of her slightly older brother as the child of an alcoholic father my dad learned every possible craft   from carpentry to construction to music out of necessity neither one of them was able to complete elementary school i remember my dad jokingly and lovingly teasing my mom for not finishing th gradehe never finished th grade music became a part of my life from early childhood since my dad through absolute grit and raw talent became principal double bass player of the guadalajara symphony now jalisco philharmonic i always loved music and was deeply moved by it but it wasnt until my dad became seriously ill that i thought about music as a potential profession i learned to play piano at the age of  when i switched careers from being a bagboy at a large grocery store to playing for church services and for choirs around the city soon enough i was making enough money to help my family which became a true necessity as my dads health progressively deteriorated when i was  my dad passed away and thus i was forced to seriously think about my future before reaching full maturity with a stay home mom and much debt from my dads long illness i decided to give up music to pursue a more financially dependable profession it was around this time that i decided to offer one last piano recital to give finality to my musical aspirations many things got in the way but a couple years later the evening of the recital finally came by happenstance on that exact night the snows an americanbritish couple were on an evening stroll and noticed a small crowd gathering outside a small concert hall near their downtown hotel to my great fortune they decided to check out the scene and step into the hall to listen to my recital this seemingly unimportant decision on their part would alter the course of my life in tremendous ways after the recital ended the snows came to greet me through my brother who was translating i understood that they thought i had talent and that they wished to help me pursue my goal to become a professional musician dr harlan snow had at some point in the past been the dean of the shenandoah conservatory of music in virginia and based on my performance that evening he thought i stood a good chance to be admitted as a student there encouraged by the snows i applied to shenandoahs piano performance program using the tapes from my farewell recital as my audition a few weeks later i was offered a full tuition room and board scholarship to attend shenandoah after learning that i couldnt afford to buy a plane ticket the snows found a sponsor to cover my initial expenses my mind has traveled back to that moment in my life numerous times was it that i was simply in the right place at the right time what drove two thencomplete strangers to help this skinny brown kid in a foreign land pursue his dreams why do some people get these chances and some dont regardless of their potential or talent whatever the answer may be this experience gave me an unshakable faith in the ability of human kindness and music to transform lives the person that i have become has been shaped by endless encounters with kind and generous people and in turn i hope to have impacted some people positively through my personal journey it is i believe this interconnectedness that gives most meaning to our lives the new orchestra of washington has grown out of this kindness the trust and love of those who have believed in the vision and mission of the orchestra is what makes us strong through the years it has been humbling and empowering for grace and me to see this increasing support as i approach the th anniversary of my arrival in america i am eager to continue showing my gratitude for my good fortune by sharing my knowledge and passion for music with others nows eighth season offers great experiences aimed to take you on an extraordinary journey with each and every program we are excited to be collaborating with amp powered by strathmore in north bethesda and the blackrock center for

as the november th date looms closer many are starting to contemplate for whom they will vote many of my conservative counterparts feel particularly pained due to my involvement as a republican nominee for county councilatlarge the elephant in the room pun intended remains my appearance over the past two years of campaigning i have learned that many especially the older generation find a harley davidson riding fullsleeved tattooed bearded guy with an unconventi  onal haircut wellisnt the conventional pick to sit on the dais of our county government one thing ill never do is lie to you and so the truth is that the looks and the whispers have bothered me at times i know full well that the reality of life is that we judge books by their covers every day still it is frustrating that people wont take the time to learn about the character within because the cover is a little frayed this isnt anything new the generational gap and the misunderstanding that comes with it repeats itself continuously i am by no means unique in my plight to try and convince my forbearers to give me a chance even though i dont seem to fit the mold they had in mind i get it still i must ask how well has that mold treated frederick county i love frederick to be frank the only thing i dont like about it is that we have allowed our county government to become infiltrated with private petty personal wars that have done nothing to move our county forward in fact i think it has done the opposite it has hindered us the visceral discord that occupies winchester hall is not reflective to a community that served as a hospital town during the civil war and is home to over  nonprofits we embrace teamwork and collaboration to solve problems now its time our government did the same i want to be part of the team that chooses to change that culture i have led under duress in a myriad of conditions combat emergency response and the boardroom ive gone from homeless and eating out of trash cans to founding soldierfit one of the fastest growing companies in america i founded and helped to establish a thriving nonprofit to combat veteran suicide ive received awards for my leadership in every undertaking army fire department business community and nonprofit sector some say i have a proven track record of success i say i have a proven track record of teamwork with all the challenges facing frederick teamwork is what we need now more than anything nothing i have ever done did i do alone many in politics will say what they will accomplish ive learned that i accomplish nothing by myself but together we can achieve anything the demands of our future are too great to elect people who wish to divide us it is time to elect people who put an end to the division by refusing to be a divider that is my pledge to you i know that i look different i know i may not be what you had in mind when you dreamed up a nominee just remember many of your parents didnt like elvis when he showed up either he was too risqu������ too different in the end though he changed the way music was performed and by the time he was done we realized that sometimes different is just what we needed httpwwwthetentaclecomshowarticlecfmmydocid,1

the belief that there is no reality beyond the physical has dominated the scientific establishment for more than a century this belief was inspired by darwin is theory of unintelligent design which has never been proved and has spread to the entire academic community in the united states where it is held as such absolute and fundamental truth that academic people who express an interest in precognition telepathy clairvoyance remote viewing psychokinesis energy medicin  e spirit entities the power of prayer reincarnation levitation or intelligent design are treated as if they were mentally incompetent shunned by their colleagues and denied publication funding and employment obviously this kind of social manipulation is neither scientific nor scholarly anybody who knows logic knows that you cannot prove a proposition of the form there are no such things unless you have a complete knowledge of the entire universe in all its dimensions and conversely it is necessary to find only one such thing to disprove it in  i dreamed of my grandmother is death an hour before i received the telegram that is all the proof i ever needed to know that there was more to reality than what could be explained by known physical laws billions of people have had similar experiences  more than  in one study done in switzerland year after year gallup polls have shown that more than  of americans believe in god or a spiritual reality establishment scientists explain this away by saying that we are all uninformed unintelligent superstitious andor delusional there is literally a ton of evidence of the psychic and the spiritual at the rhine research center and yet establishment scientists claim that this evidence has to be flawed because they know with certainty that such things could not possibly exist dirty science exposes this inaccurate unscientific and manipulative thinking the lies behind it and the arrogance in representing it as scientific it calls this corruption it compares this corruption to the corruption that led to the protestant reformation and the corruption that prompted the french revolution the people we have trusted to give us accurate knowledge have betrayed us  million college graduates in america have been exposed to this invalid thinking also everybody in college or contemplating college needs to be warned of it do them a favor and give them dirty science for christmas you can find it on amazoncom is this a good book see on amazoncom its good reviews and the awards it has won  bob gebelein author,1
experience matters i want to share my experience with you because i believe experience is important in deciding how to cast your vote for any elected office i am a missoula native and i have lived in missoula county my entire life ive watched missoula grow and change and i am acutely aware of the issues past and present facing missoula county i began my service to missoula county in  as a member of the missoula county sheriffs office cadet program i knew i wante  d to become a deputy sheriff for my hometown and i started working toward my goal as early as i possibly could even early on i had aspirations to one day serve as the sheriff of missoula county i knew that kind of commitment takes a great deal of effort and i knew that i needed to begin with a strong foundation to support my lofty goals since my early start i have sought out as many available opportunities to serve the community as my schedule would allow in  i completed an emergency medical technician course i began volunteering with the east missoula rural fire district as a firefighter and emt in  i am still a licensed emt  years later and i still volunteer my time with the same fire department as the assistant fire chief i started working full time for missoula county as a  dispatcher in  i quickly became a training officer and later completed a crisis intervention team course i trained a number of new dispatchers in five years and spent countless hours answering the phones and radios for our countywide  service i have been the administrative captain deputy chief and i currently serve as the assistant fire chief for east missoula rural fire district i have helped manage the annual operating budget i have written and managed grants for federal funding and i help supervise a roster of  volunteers in  i spearheaded our summertime wildland contract program which has increased our operating budget and allowed our resources to serve communities around the country during large natural disasters and long summertime fire seasons this program has expanded and is still very successful for our department today as the assistant chief i developed a successful local levy that was presented to the voters in east missoula and passed with over  approval these funds allowed our department to purchase a new fire apparatus to improve our response to emergency situations in our fire district this helped lower homeowner insurance rates in east missoula by increasing our fleet of available engines to respond to any emergencies in turn giving our department a higher rating with the insurance service organization firefighter safety is important to me to enhance firefighter safety i worked to develop the first written document detailing our department personnel policies and standard operating guidelines in the almost  year history of the department these documents enhance the safety and operational practices of our firefighters and they are still used as a training guide for every new volunteer professional education is also important to me i attended a federal national park service law enforcement academy in ohio and also attended the montana law enforcement academy i graduated from the federal course ranked  in academic achievement after  weeks of intense physical and academic training i have a bachelor of science in criminology and criminal justice from portland state university and i have also attended the university of montana for some core courses i graduated from my degree program with honors as a member of the national criminal justice honor society i have hundreds of hours of certified continuing education and i am a mt state certified law enforcement instructor i was hired as a deputy sheriff with missoula county in  i have served in various capacities as a deputy including field training officer cadet program coordinator hostage negotiator and detective i have volunteered for these additional positions eagerly knowing that each new opportunity allows me to give back to the communities in new and different ways in  my wife and i opened our home to foster children by becoming a state licensed foster home we have received more than  children into our home on temporary and long term placements we adopted our two children from the foster care system and have continued serving atrisk children in this capacity by maintaining an active foster home license to this day we began this process before we were even married after recognizing the great need for such families not just in missoula county but around the country and the opportunities we have been presented with have been life changing i joined the board of directors for court appointed special advocates casa of missoula in  this opportunity has been very rewarding i am able to give back to the same program that gave a voice to my own children as they were involved in the foster care system more than  children are in foster care in montana and more than  children nationwide the drug epidemic in our country increases this number every day and i am proud to provide a home for children experiencing unsafe situations here in our county missoula is my home i want to raise my growing family in a safe community and i have dedicated my life to working to make missoula a safer and familyfriendly place to put down roots i have chosen to run as a candidate for sheriff after recognizing a great need for change in our county integrity fiscal responsibility and community safety are vital to the success of any law enforcement agency and i hope to bring balance to these areas inside of our sheriffs office if you choose to elect me experience does not come from an ability to tick off another year toward retirement a person can spend  years punching a time clock without ever becoming a leader or displaying any qualities of leadership leadership is not just about a title you earned in your professional life but it must be a demonstrated ability to put the needs of others above your own needs and it must pour out into your personal life as well as your profession a true leader sets the example to be followed in an organization and this example should reflect the values of the community the leader represents as a voter you must decide what kind of leader you will elect and what qualities of leadership are important to you when casting your vote choose wisely and research every avenue before you make your decision i hope that you will recognize my skills and abilities as a leader are more than just a tally of years spent wearing a badge integrity professionalism and service to my community are the qualities i have dedicated my life to honoring as a leader in our community both professionally and personally giving back to the missoula community has been a lifelong goal of mine and i hope that you will allow me the opportunity to continue this path by voting for me to become the next sheriff of missoula county on november th,1

severe that her husband joe asked that if she did not survive her first round of stem cell therapy could he get a refund elaine was one of the worst cases that has ever presented to our clinic stated dr johnson now shes doing fantastic i have never seen such an incredible turnaround in my plus years of practice joe norris a family friend wrote this on elaines testimonial video on dr johnsons youtube channel the following thank you thank you thank you thank you joe is son erin is my best friend of  years we graduated together erins mom and dad are wonderful people for the past year we have been so worried and scared for my extended family i got to see joe and elaine a week ago at erin is birthday party and praise god the woman is totally different whatever you are doing sir god has got your back and is helping thank you for the extra time you have given my brother with his mother go to wwwohstemcellinfo  click on testimonials and see for yourself watch elainepart  elainepart  and all of our other lung disease success patient testimonials when gail palmer and her family from thorp wi were given the dreaded diagnosis of multiple system atrophy msa they were told that nothing more could be done not one but two mds at the famed mayo clinic told gails family that they should go home and make gail as comfortable as possible until she passes away within a year multiple system atrophy msa is a rare degenerative neurological disorder affecting the body is involuntary autonomic functions including blood pressure breathing bladder function and muscle control formerly called shydrager syndrome msa shares many parkinson is diseaselike symptoms such as slow movement rigid muscles and poor balance the condition progresses gradually and eventually leads to death gails daughter janelle refused to accept gails fate and she started researching for help on the internet janelle happened across dr michael johnsons ms facebook page pmd him and asked if there was anything that he could do yes was dr johnsons reply and the rest is history to date gail has made miraculous improvement dr johnson is the founder and clinic director at the optimal health stem cell and wellness institute in appleton wi he has assembled a team of medical professionals and support staff that are dedicated to the worst of the worst cases as a direct result of the care that gail received at the optimal health stem cell amp wellness institute she has made incredible improvement she is walking talking writing better along with clearer thinking and most importantly continued success week by week gails progress is documented on video at wwwohstemcellinfo click on testimonials it takes more than stem cell therapy to help severely chronic patients because many of these patients are full of inflammation and inflammation kills off stem cells says dr johnson we do complete blood work hormone testing genetic testing and trigger testing for underlying infections and toxins since we are the only stem cell clinic that performs complete testing along with umbilical cord injections into the brown fat for systemic patients and joints for pain patients come to our office from all over the world johnson said one of the complaints against stem cell therapy by some mds is that there isnt enough research that is not true said dr johnson there are thousands of research articles on stem cells and stem cell therapy at wwwpubmedcom all that anyone has to do is a simple search besides it takes more than just stem cell therapy to get the chronic patient better stem cell therapy supports the body to allow for maximum healing and there are successful stem cell protocols not only for lung conditions like copd ipf and emphysema but also neurological conditions ms parkinsons amp stroke autoimmune disorders ra lupus sjogrens fibromyalgia ulcerative colitis crohns and others kidney disease liver disease and chronic pain syndromes headaches neck shoulder lower back hip and knee pain dr johnson founded the optimal health stem cell amp wellness institute because he suffers from ms and stem cell therapy helped him i used to think that ms was a curse but now i see it as a blessing because i know firsthand what works and what doesnt work for the chronic and severe patient said dr johnson our motto is that we will do whatever it takes to help our patients get

"monthly section signed stephanie stpierre
when plastic invites itself into the depths of the sea
since march the daily lives of quebec citizens have changed in many ways with covid having something to do with it many social and environmental issues have been neglected at least temporarily far be it from me to trivialize the pandemic because it is indeed an unprecedented context for each of us a context that forces us to adapt however it is clear that ecological and ecoresponsible habits have been relegated to a lower rank to avoid the risk of contamination plastic and overpackaging have resurfaced more present than ever in these troubled times the singleuse plastic that we were so desperate to annihilate is now back on the shelves of supermarkets and small retailers the consequences linked to its consumption for marine ecosystems are not new however since already in january  alexandre shields published an article in le devoir in which he explained that if the trend continues with regard to the use of plastic there may well be more plastic than fish in the oceans by  plastic pollution is one of the most serious threats facing ocean ecosystems but unfortunately its consequences are not well understood by the citizens as a result this problem is constantly being swept under the rug
since the announcement of the pandemic confinement deconfinement the wearing of the compulsory mask things have happened around the world life has not completely stopped which is why i decided to dig up a study dating from last may which unfortunately went unnoticed when it was published and which nevertheless deserves our attention the magazine science published the results obtained by european researchers who analyzed the impacts of ocean currents on the circulation of plastic particles that end up in the sediments of marine environments these same researchers have thus discovered that the currents of the depths of the seas and oceans very often concentrate the microplastic in certain places this accumulation has the effect of creating the equivalent of plastic continents but these are now found in the seabed the study shows that each year more than  million tonnes of plastic are dumped into the seas and oceans of the planet once plastic particles find their way to the deep sea they can persist for thousands of years
each of us will certainly remember when in the early s oceanographer charles moore discovered the plastic continent of the pacific located between hawaii and california at present there are eight of these continents of waste that concentrate millions of tons of plastic transported by ocean currents according to scientists this pollution that accumulates on the surface of the water constitutes only  of all marine pollution this leaves  of plastic particles and detritus that end up in the depths of the sea and which as a result can be ingested by fish and other marine organisms who confuse these particles with their food this problem is not recent in  a study published in the journal nature communications explained that the world is rivers transport more than two million tons of plastic to the oceans each year the study published in science magazine reaffirms the need for policies if we are to limit the concentration of plastic in natural environments and minimize the impacts on marine ecosystems
quebec meanwhile is not spared by this contamination from plastics researchers from mcgill university have also conducted a study on the section of the st lawrence river located between quebec and montreal and they come to the conclusion that the st lawrence would be among the worst rivers on the planet regarding microplastic pollution the researchers mention concentrations that can reach several hundred particles for one kilogram of sediment prior to the pandemic calls to reduce plastic use were common but global plastic production continues to grow in the current context fear of contamination has reintroduced singleuse plastic packaging with some businesses going so far as to ban reusable packaging and containers the demand for plastic has recently increased which is bound to have terrible repercussions on marine ecosystems
health security is important even essential but we also have a duty as citizens to be aware of the consequences of our actions reducing plastic production is the only viable solution if we wish to restrict and control pollution on the high seas it is high time to realize that the problem of waste management in the sea has consequences as important as pollution on the ground it is imperative to conduct more studies on the ecological impacts of plastic particle pollution in the deep sea but it is also essential that every citizen weighs and weighs the weight of their daily actions there is always a way to opt for sustainable and responsible consumption habits that do not jeopardize deep waters and the flora and fauna they contain",1

a new study by the thomas b fordham institute which is an education reform think tank found that there is a large gap between the number of white students when compared to the number of black and hispanic students in gifted programs in schools across our country but particularly here in north carolina the institute reviewed national data on gifted programs in highpoverty schools which are generally filled with black and brown students the gifted gap report found tha  t while most highpoverty schools offer programs for gifted students they tend to have few students enrolled researchers involved in the study determined that africanamerican and hispanic students are underrepresented in gifted programs in all states and in all types of schools but even more so in schools where most students come from impoverished backgrounds north carolina is among  states where fewer than  percent of black and hispanic students are in gifted programs compared with almost  percent of all north carolina students in north carolina schools with poverty levels of  percent or higher only  percent of black and hispanic students and  percent of all students were in gifted programs this finding was among the nations lowest levels the study reinforces the findings of counted out a  investigative series by the charlotte observer and the raleigh news amp observer that examined seven years of state data focusing on lowincome students with high scores on state math exams the data compiled showed that lowincome students were less likely than nonpoor students with similar scores to get access to gifted programs and advanced classes the fordham report recommends using new universal screening practices to identify gifted students it is disappointing to see that we are not investing in our students from lowincome families and in students of color to help them to achieve their highest potential our school systems need to make sure that they are investing in all of our students and that they are allowing them the opportunity to become part of gifted programs these programs can allow them to succeed not only in school but also during the course of their lives httpwwwcharlotteobservercomedarticlehtml,1

"politically the markey kennedy primary is a most interesting contest i have run several informal polls mostly on progressive sites which all show a strong preference for markey now the daily kos endorses him it is clear that the more progressive wing of the democratic party favor and will be voting for markey over kennedy in the democratic primary
nowadays in the republican party the winners in the primaries are the more right wing candidates the interesting question here is will the more progressive candidate win in this massachusetts senate primary race no matter who wins what the result says about the democratic party in massachusetts is a very interesting question
of course the name kennedy may be making a disportioncate difference here that in itself is fascinating as decades have passed since the  is and the days of president kennedy and robert kennedy will new generations with all that has happened and that which exists in modern society respond enthusiastically enough to vote for a kennedy on the basis of name largely alone and against a long proven established senator preferred by young progressives like aoc and the sunrise movement
something in my gut has all along made me queasy about voting against markey in this context i love the kennedy is and what they have done for our party and country and i wish joe kennedy iii would take up their mantle and fight loudly and with moral conviction against injustices like racism inequality gun violence and the desecration of our environment like robert kennedy did then run for senator or governor and i would be first in line for him

if you want to leave a good comment for bari weiss that would be nice she is getting tons of hate today for speaking truth the right has been damaged beyond belief by its embrace of mr trump that trumpian logic and trumpian loyalty is now beginning to infect the left is nothing to cheer read and share on thursday ms salazar a yearold rookie politician and democratic socialist trounced an eightterm state senator in the democratic primary in new yorks th dis  trict the district is gentrifying north brooklyn  east williamsburg bushwick  and there is no republican on the ballot so ms salazar is guaranteed to win in november that she pulled this off even though she is to put it gently allergic to the truth tells you a lot about our current political moment its one thing to change your mind and ms salazar has on several fronts in less than a decade she went from being prolife to prochoice from a conservative christian zionist to an outspoken advocate of the boycott divestment and sanctions movement against israel from a registered republican to a progressive insistent that she is actively working to dismantle capitalism and to abolish the immigration and customs enforcement its the ideological equivalent of a cinnamonraisin bagel with lox strange but technically kosher but evolving politically is different from fabricating your life story a few weeks ago ms salazar was perfectly positioned as the robin to alexandria ocasiocortezs batman she was a colombian immigrant with a columbia degree a jew of color and a workingclass girl raised by a single mother without a college degree who had struggled to support her family she was treated to flattering profiles in outlets like the village voice and new york magazine the problem is that few of the details were true ms salazar was born in south florida she was raised in a catholic home and her conversion story which no one can verify keeps changing she never graduated from columbia unlike her mother who in fact did finish college she grew up in a comfortable middleclass home she even has a trust fund much of this factchecking was helped along by ms salazars own family members who seemed distressed about the way their past was being discussed in the press ms salazar claimed that her brother alex had a political ax to grind he has very rightwing politics she told vox very antisocialist politics her brother responded that his aim was telling the truth about my family its hard to recall an instance where a candidates integrity was being openly challenged by her family more than by her political opponent ms salazars first instinct was to accuse tablet magazine where i used to be an editor of practicing race science when it cracked open the story in august about inconsistencies in her background and raised questions about her account of converting to judaism a few days before voters went to the polls she softened it a bit for rolling stone i regret not having the foresight to anticipate being misunderstood but none of it mattered she won  percent of the vote   to her opponents  in the runup to the election only citizens union a good government group dropped its endorsement on the grounds that ms salazar had provided incorrect information about her academic credentials ms ocasiocortez doubled down on her support for the candidate saying through a spokesman that she remained behind her  percent cynthia nixon who in july called ms salazar the future of the democratic party never wavered nor did the new york city comptroller scott stringer and the democratic socialists of america threw its organizing support behind her a known liar is now heading to albany at least shell be in good company no matter how many things ms salazar makes up it seems unfair to liken her to our posttruth president who lies on a much grander scale and who has the power to do far far greater damage and yet the willingness of ms salazars supporters to look past her fabrications sounds eerily familiar to the justifications trump supporters made in  yes hes distasteful and prone to exaggeration but hes promising to pass policies we like supporting him is a price worth paying in pursuit of our goals even the rights dismissal of anything critical of mr trump as fake news has its leftwing equivalent on friday on the website jacobin a democratic socialist writer celebrated ms salazars win and dismissed the presss unprecedented smears there was he says no smoking gun and the whole thing could be chalked up to hostility to her political views  or worse to some kind of rightwing conspiracy in this her supporters were helped by one story where her testimony rings true ms salazar is one of a dozen women who have accused david keyes until this week a top aide to prime minister benjamin netanyahu of israel of sexual misconduct he denies the allegations but i know several of the women who have accused mr keyes and i am convinced they are telling the truth given the pattern of his alleged behavior i have every reason to believe that julia salazar is too but her supporters are now using this episode to paint a broader falsehood theyre implying that the critical reporting was ginned up by rightwing zionists to discredit her  that shes a victim of a targeted campaign rather than a woman who was victimized by a man but also one who fabricated parts of her past for political gain just like mr trumps supporters her fans have reserved much of their hostility for the media which had the chutzpah to ask basic questions of a person running for elected office the right has been damaged beyond belief by its embrace of mr trump that trumpian logic and trumpian loyalty is now beginning to infect the left is nothing to cheer bari weiss is a staff editor and writer

shannon was a typical kid she liked watching tv climbing trees running around her neighborhood she had long hair and long arms as she was growing into a tween she went to church her family was in law enforcement in her town and as she was growing into her yearold body she was being raped by a relative she became pregnant at  years old she did not know it until well after she missed her period unlike most kids her age she knew it came every  days when it di  dnt come she thought maybe this month was a little different more days passed she started feeling sick she started vomiting she thought about one of her favorite shows  full house  and went to the store to get a pregnancy test she felt embarrassed so she said she was picking up a test for her mom she went into some woods climbed a tree and tested herself alone she was pregnant with her rapist is child in america at least  of young girls are sexually assaulted  of them by a relative of those girls who are sexually assaulted by family members well over  are raped states throughout our country  including missouri  are pushing laws to force yearold girls like shannon to carry their rapists children no matter the mental impact it will forever have on the children forced into  months of pregnancy after being raped not only babies having babies but babies forced to have babies by their rapists and their government children are more likely to suffer physical consequences from their pregnancies they are more likely to have complicated pregnancies to suffer from severe depression to die during the process in  when the supreme court ruled that women have a right to get abortions the court did not say that abortions were good or bad they said that they are a right we have to be free from the regulation of the state that the government should not impose its view or its restrictions on women at a moment when only the pregnant woman can truly understand what she is going through the supreme court did not stop the states from making their communities better for women and children and making sure that all pregnant women were served well in america it said the conversation a woman has with her doctor is none of the state is business when abortion was illegal women still had them because the reasons to have them  nonviable pregnancies substantial risks to health inability to afford a child unsupportive partners and families rape  were everpresent and as we ban the practice in america again those reasons still exist if this was about helping women or babies we would be passing legislation to ensure expectant mothers have all the resources they could ever need we would make sure women had excellent prenatal and mental health care we would form supportive community groups that provided accurate medical information to women we would make it easy for women to make the right choice for them in america but this is not about women or babies america has one of the worst infant mortality rates among wealthy countries missouri is rate is even worse than our already terrible national average and despite bills being proposed to support pregnant mothers those are not being passed those bills do not get the televised support of the governor like this forcedpregnancy bill has gotten instead of making pregnancy safer our government has decided to require it it is not about making people safer it is not about addressing the reasons why abortions happen it is not about understanding that without access to health care many women will die it is not about the wellbeing of yearolds like shannon it is about control it is about a government with the power to make even the most private decisions for women it is about having a maledominated government that includes very few legislators with medical expertise tell women and their doctors that the government knows best this missouri forcedpregnancy law is unconstitutional it breaches the separation of church and state  it includes religious tenets in the actual bill  and it violates our right to privacy and to be free from government regulation in making such important medical decisions it will cost the state a lot of money to litigate and defend the law despite its unconstitutionality the attorney general is office should be providing litigation cost estimates for bills like this one that are glaringly unconstitutional for the public to see instead of putting that money into making our state a better home for mothers and children we are going to waste it on lawyers that is because this is not about protecting anyone it is about control missouri will not be a better place because women and children are forced by their government into pregnancy that is not prolife that is procruelty if prolife is what you want id humbly recommend we make sure our mothers stop dying in our hospitals we do not force yearolds into pregnancy and we quit telling women and their doctors we know better,1

rd graders coronavirus project sitting home is literally killing our country the usa acted as ignorant cowards we will lose more lives and livelihoods than corona will ever take read this hi im jimmy im in the rd grade home doing a math and science project on the cv to determine what is best way to save lives and the economy for the greater good using the data we currently have i took  studies on how many people are at higher risk and very low risk to potential death if infected with cv then i averaged all  and rounded the numbers off for simplicity here is the data about  of the american population are at very low risk of fatality and  are at higher risk like my gramma one interesting fact there have been two cases of seniors citizens in their s and one woman was over  years old who had the virus and were treated and are doing well the  group majority is naturally the population that drives the economy and the majority of the  do not drive our economy america pulled the low risk population  out of the workforce this is illogical according to data we could have kept the economy running and tended to senior citizens and other high risk people by delivering them food vitamins medications at their home etc and potentially create jobs for people who could have delivered necessary items to the higher risk population jiao shenme minzi a medical researcher from zanjan university in china is where america wants to be with this virus i used jiao because china has complete control of the virus jiao states its a simple virus that you can get rid of meaning the cv virus will not live in your body forever like many more complex viruses if you catch it once its gone but you will have a stronger immunity for when it comes back yearly im not sure if america plans on pulling the workforce out of the economy from their jobs every year or if they are just gambling that our scientists create a vaccine viruses are notoriously difficult to cure hiv took  years to develop medicine that can prevent people from developing aids influenza has taken decades to merely reduce infection with yearly injections to about  hpv warts and herpes both are still incurable viruses the proof is in the pudding the evidence that this researcher is correctis the extremely low rate of death from this virus relative to the massive amount of people who wasis infected with cv worldwide its simple third grade math early on the cv virus was considered more dangerous than the common flu this is when we had little data as of now it has appears to be less lethal than the common flu as the common flu kills over  people every year in united states because of lack of testing in america we dont know how many people are infected the realistic estimate in us is at least  people have cv most are asymptotic because their bodies immune system fights it they may never realize they hadhave it others will have flu like symptoms perhaps worse but overcome in a week or two the low risk population who get infected will build an immunity that could help them fight the virus if scientists cannot develop a vaccine additionally building a herd immunity will reduce spreading the virus in the future the great depression killed about  million people the math suggests a recession or depression is imminent if america doesnt get the low risk population back to work this was hard to calculate but based on the trillion or more dollars weve borrowed in a couple weeks and the millions the economy is losing daily a recession is probable if the government doesnt put the low risk people back to work by mid april ive estimated if for whatever reason the low risk workers who drive the economy are not back to work by may st we will go into an economic depression many more lives will be lost in an economic depression than the few hundred america has sadly already lost to cv my conclusion shows illogical fears were the catalyst to an irrational approach to combat this unknown virus its not too late however please put your emotions aside and look at the evidence and you will see that pulling low risk economy workers was counterproductive it did not save lives because again as far as i could find no low risk person worldwide has died due to cv some people may argue it slowed the spread maybe so but if we have all our high risk people safe at home the stoppage of work only cost this country massive amounts of money not lives by this time about  weeks later from inception of cv to us the virus may have run its rounds and be on its way out pulling the economy driversworkers nationwide did set us up for a catastrophic economic oblivion and all the horrors of poverty especially to many americans i blame no one my dad doesnt allow me on facebook but he posts this everywhere he says people are arguing and fighting over everything about this virus these are scary times i dont want to lose my grandma either and i was scared i think we all must remain as calm as possible keep your health strong during this time my gram always tells me to look for opportunity during adversity i think this is an opportunity for the entire world to bond and support each other with kindness and respect ultimately we are all responsible for ourselves all the pointing fingers the entitlement of citizens demanding the government to be perfect and protect us all from such a bizarre fast spreading unknown virus is not only unrealistic its counterproductive in no way do i think my project data is a cure all or the best approach my hopes is to reevaluate our defense toward the virus im  certain what we are doing is not conducive to the greater good of america we must change the approach before we self sabotage america beyond repair i hope my project results help anyone who is scared its normal to be scared of some virus we have no idea about my project was limited in these early stages but we definitely have the living proof that its not nearly as deadly as once assumed blessings to the world may we all work together as a loving family to defeat this virus noone alive has had the same struggles worldwide if this is not a sign to unite not only in america but worldwide nothing is jimmy g thinking about a change worth making,1

in the wake of a new report warning of climate change environmentalists will rally in munich germany this sunday to demand a halt to nuclear plant closures which they say are increasing air pollution and lockingin fossil fuels michael is latest column for forbes  please share ________________________ over the last year environmentalists have faulted germany for abandoning its  climate goals bulldozing an ancient forest to mine for coal and exporting deadly air pollution to its neighbors i hope people see that what motivates nuclear supporters is the wish to leave a better world to our children said iida ruishalme of mothers for nuclear we want to let friends of nuclear know that they are not alone organizers from over a dozen grassroots environmental groups expect hundreds of pronuclear atomic humanists to come from across europe to sundays nuclear pride fest in munichs marienplatz from  am to  pm the environmentalists point to evidence that every time nuclear plants are closed they are replaced mostly by fossil fuels because solar and wind are so unreliable organizers say the nuclear pride fest will be the first time environmentalists have rallied in favor of nuclear their goal is both to urge the continued operation of nuclear plants and to confront what they say is an irrational stigma at the very least said amardeo sarma cofounder of the ecomodernist society germany should stop trying to intimidate other european countries to close their nuclear plants despite having spent  billion on renewables like solar and wind german emissions have remained unchanged since  thanks its abandonment of nuclear power which does not produce greenhouse gas emissions had germany spent that  billion on nuclear instead of renewables and the fossil plant upgrades and grid expansions they require it could have replaced all of the fossil fuels it uses for both electricity and transportation and now energy experts predict german emissions will rise in  given the closure of a nuclear reactor in the final hours of  pronuclear people are motivated by their love of nature and humankind said fest cosponsor rebecca lohfert from denmark the scientific evidence for nuclear is overwhelming and yet it is still taboo to be pronuclear climate isnt the only motivation for the protesters bjorn peters the head of energy policy and analysis at the german employers association dav warned bavaria cannot afford the phaseout of its remaining two nuclear power plants gundremmingen c and isar  without severe risks of power cuts the cards will be reshuffled when we experience blackouts said rainer klute of nuklearia a pronuclear german group gasfired power stations will increase costs emissions and dependance on russian natural gas while a massive electrical grid expansion to support solar and wind is catastrophically behind schedule according to its energy minister germanys construction of a new  billion pipeline to bring more natural gas from russia is onschedule germany is struggling in other ways electricity prices have increased  over the last decade and despite a  increase in solar panels since  germany produced less electricity from solar in  than in  for the simple reason that it was less sunny germany in recent years has pressured its neighbors to close nuclear plants by raising fears and threatening to cut off fuel supplies and in response to recent elections spain is seeking to close its nuclear plants not all european nations are backing away from nuclear last november french president emmanuel macron faulted german nuclear closures they worsened their co footprint it wasnt good for the planet so i wont do that said macron frances electricity supply is  times less carbonintensive than germanys if european leaders follow the example of president macron said sarma we stand a chance of limiting damage from climate change,1
"more than dolphins in venice during the pandemic
the global coronavirus pandemic has many negative consequences ranging from redundancies to increased domestic violence and psychological problems not to mention the high number of deaths no positive change redeems and justifies these evils however there are positive developments that are worth noting as they reveal that some scenarios sometimes considered utopian are quite possible this gives hope that the suppression of a pandemic can not only restore the situation but also improve it
decreased consumption consumption of travel clothing entertainment and beauty services in quarantine countries fell by more than  consumption has fallen less but still significantly in many other sectors some of the reasons for this decline are sad redundancies economic insecurity and illness however part of the decline certainly depends on the forced change in daily habits probably many have experienced that as services have become more difficult to access a number of services and products have proved to be less and less needed declining consumption is a huge horror for the current economy based on steady growth but it must not be forgotten that such growth is already reaching human and natural limits we have at best about  years to prevent a climate catastrophe a sustainable economy will require both less production and less consumption reduced consumption does not necessarily mean poverty but can be addressed through greater social guarantees but this necessarily means limiting and redistributing the surplus
reduced pollution according to the world health organization air pollution before the virus was the cause of the global health crisis which claimed  million lives each year during quarantine a drastic reduction in pollution is observed around the world apart from the direct positive effects on health reducing pollution is also necessary to tackle the longterm climate crisis although pollution levels are likely to return to previous and even higher levels after the end of the pandemic we can clearly see the effects of the current reduction improvements in air quality in europe have reduced the number of asthma cases premature births and deaths from airrelated diseases compared to previous years with the weather shining in the punjab region of india people saw the peaks of the himalayas on the horizon for the first time in decades we need more of these changes even in a nonpandemic environment
assessment of migrants rights the pandemic has shown how important it is to treat everyone is health equally if everyone does not have access to at least one they are at risk although the living conditions of migrants have deteriorated in many places especially in pretrial detention camps the need to empower migrants for the benefit of all has been recognized elsewhere in portugal at the beginning of the quarantine it was granted to all people waiting for a residence permit along with citizens rights including the right to health care south korea which has about  illegal migrants has decided to provide virus testing and treatment services during the quarantine without requiring documents western european countries began to realize the need for unskilled migrants from the east when they went to their homelands to quarantine it is becoming increasingly clear that global systems and problems require global rights
in addition to these moments efforts to increase worker protection by compensating for lost wages and downtime in the us denmark and elsewhere the nationalization of private health services in spain or the nationalization of airlines in italy should be mentioned in addition countries with free health care systems such as lithuania have proven to be much better at dealing with the virus than for example the united states whose health care is based on private insurance and where covid is the most prevalent in the world
with or without the virus the global social economic and climate crisis will continue and much will need to change the pandemic has made it quite clear what works in existing social systems what does not work and what can or should work to make everyone not only survive but also live healthier safer and better

california voter rolls were hacked in  we all have heard how the current secretary of state was incompetent when he rolled out the dmv motor voter program the dmv motor voter has adversely affected hundreds of thousands of californians however most californians have not heard that the dmv debacle was just another example in the long list of incompetence demonstrated by the current secretary of state did you know that in  the current secretary of state rolled out  an online voter registration process that hackers were able to use to change voters party registration so that they were not able to vote in the presidential primary the current california secretary of state had no safeguards in place to protect us from hackers and had no system to track the hackers so they could be caught the current incompetent california secretary of state has proven that he is reactive rather than proactive rather than protect the voter rolls from hackers he simply waited until the problem was discovered and then he attempted to fix the problem time and time again the incompetent secretary of state has shown he cannot anticipate the most likely threats to our voter systems and protect us from them the voters in california are grateful to the work done by the riverside district attorney who made sure california voter rolls were protected from hackers if you want a proactive secretary of state who will fight to protect the voter rolls from hackers then you must vote for me to be your next secretary of state please vote on november th  electionsmatter wwwmarkmeusercom,1

when asked about their campaign issues on an editorial board questionnaire savietto gave a generic list starting with guaranteeing all children receive a quality education and ensuring adequate school safety ayala however emphasized what savietto did not mention ensuring a safe return during covid including efficiently using new technology
that was the more pertinent answer and it seems typical of ayala who interviews as someone with unusual energy passion selfconfidence and the agility to think quickly and creatively about fastchanging conditions
ayala said she would be the rare board member who makes herself visible around the community and that she would ratchet up the fight against racism for example by urging participation in workshops of the racial equity institute
the school board currently has no one of ayala is generation in its ranks she would be a refreshing addition she would bring an easy familiarity with technology and being only about a decade older than this year is high school graduates she would be uniquely attuned to student attitudes and needs
voters should give the preternaturally impressive ayala their nod

i wasnt sure about writing a book on addiction especially my addiction  but then i read a study that completely changed my mind it shows just how important it is that we all change how we talk about addiction and how we view those struggling with addiction   two researchers leake and king went to three different alcohol recovery centers and started analyzing the files and data on the patients there    at the end of their time they told the staff at these centers which clients they believed were most likely to recover   the researchers then tracked the progress of everyone leaving the center   a year later the individuals they identified were still more likely than the rest to be employed and sober and to have had fewer and shorter relapses   what had the researchers observed that allowed them to so accurately predict success   nothing   leake and king randomly assigned people to be on the list of those with a high chance of recovery   they didnt tell the patients only the staff   what changed is that the staff were more likely to believe that someone could recover when the beliefs of the staff changed so did the outcomes   it doesnt end there   another study showed that just the tone of voice a doctor uses judgmental vs empathetic can change the likelihood of someone recovering   small changes can have an outsized impact   i truly believe that  if we change what we believe about those who are addicted we can curb the tide of the overdose epidemic   so yes i hope you check out the book but most of all i hope you are a part of changing the conversation,1

covid un roman global dans un village global
let us briefly describe the main actors of this adventure novel in the heart of the covid pandemic the story revolves around two central characters elisay and amigioli they symbolize the future love faith hope and interbreeding in a world plagued by fear xenophobia ignorance and withdrawal
when dr amigioli left his country of origin gondwanaya to study at the prince leopold institute of tropical medicine in antwerp belgium he did not expect to meet the love of his life but elisay a scholarship student from pattaya thailand resplendent with beauty crosses his path and kindles the flame of his heart their love blossoms during their studies but too soon elisay must return to thailand and amigioli must return home to gondwanaya before starting her new internship in montreal
before they separate however they promise to get married in gondwanaya as soon as they can in the year 
but  is a particular year and a silent killer is about to ravage the five continents when elisay and amigioli land in gondwanaya they have no way of knowing how the covid would change their lives and embark on an unprecedented adventure
elisay contracted the flu shortly after arriving in the village of amigioli terrified of what will happen if covid enters their community the locals fed by false information or fake news from crooked leaders are planning to burn her alive
as the lovers try to flee the village the tragedy strikes and they must fight for their survival and the survival of gondwanaya which has become the epicenter of the covid pandemic worldwide
life is made up of unexpected and adversity no one knows herself or himself until she has suffered this novel is a living proof people who pass through the most extreme suffering are often those who can understand what empathy humility forgiveness love and faith is it is through these fire trials that they improve get rid of their slag and evolve to reach maturity
collectively humanity will pass through trials so that we can learn together and evolve towards a better world
in addition to a health challenge covid is also a social economic and political challenge there was a world before covid and there will be another world after postcovid the world will still feel deeply about the changes brought about by this pandemic
the covid crisis is unique in the history of modern epidemics and has left an indelible impact on health social and economic structures what have we learned collectively as a result of this pandemic in order to make this world a better place and give hope to those who languish in misery and ignorance how will this covid pandemic create a turning point in the history of humanity a new world is emerging as a result of covid
covid has also highlighted our limits in terms of collective capacity to provide an integrated response to a global problem this pandemic has highlighted social economic and health inequalities within a country and between countries all nations are not equal before covid and will not be able to face in a similar way the economic social health and political consequences of covid how could we achieve a better world with more possibilities and solidarity health is a human right every citizen on this planet has the right to a fair and quality health system in short to universal health coverage
moreover the crisis of covid also showed the weaknesses of the global governance system and the capitalist system such as we know it currently should we not allow capitalism to emerge with a more human fairer and more just face should not we guarantee a basic universal income for every human being should not we have access to universal education should not we be exploiting current wealth while being respectful of the environment and thinking of the future generation
when i speak of solidarity allow me dear readers to take a detour and illustrate this concept of solidarity through my own story i was born in one of the poorest countries on this planet haiti i could not even have written a novel like this without the solidarity that i benefited from my earliest childhood to adulthood when i finished with my medical studies i was able to benefit from a scholarship from the belgian government to go and study in belgium at the institute of tropical medicine imt prince leopold and also a scholarship from the canadian government so i could attend the university of montreal in canada
i thank all my teachers in belgium bart criel bruno meessen jean pierre unger pierre blaise sylvie dugas guy kegels bruno marchal vincent de brouwere jean van der vennet jean macq tom hoeree monique van dormael isa bogaert claire van maerken to name a few subsequently i was able to benefit from a scholarship for a doctorate in public health at the university of montreal in canada thanks to the canadian government
most of the concepts in this novel i owe them to my professors at the university of montreal they introduced me to parsons theory of social action and to a more integrated vision of the world i thank my professors from the university of montreal francois champagne lambert farand francois beland valery ride nicole leduc mariepascale pomey andrepierre contandriopoulos astrid brousselle lise lamothe claude sicotte to name a few as a citizen from a developing country i would not have been able to get out of it without this international solidarity towards me through scholarships and career opportunities on a global scale we must create a system where each citizen of this planet can have access to education health care social and economic opportunities we need a winwin arrangement
i dedicate this novel to my american adoptive mother mrs bernadette white kummer she symbolizes the very image of solidarity and renunciation in order to help others get out of it she has grown old now she lives in a small house on long island in the united states usa she devoted the best years of her life to improving the living conditions of the poor in haiti and the united states in her native country i take my hat off to you well done you are my model my source of inspiration
will we lead to the internationalization of social and economic inequalities or will we drive to the internationalization of solidarity love and hope this novel is very timely at a crucial moment in the history of humanity where we will have to evolve individually and collectively in order to face the significant challenges to come the main thing is that through this covid pandemic we will emerge more substantial and better this novel is a novel of hope solidarity social justice peace love faith in a world of despair suffering misery and ignorance
the covid has shown that we are all interconnected and that we can no longer live in isolation in our little corner we are all linked either in the visible or invisible world what we see as reality the visible dimension is only a reflection of the invisible or of our individual and collective consciousness by improving both individually and collectively we will be able to project more light into this dark world and together we will be able to illuminate ourselves and create a beam of light for the progress of humanity towards an inclusive society based on love and solidarity
i wish you immense joy and pleasure in reading this novel and above all i hope that a miracle will happen at the end of reading this book your deep and lasting transformation
i love you from the bottom of my heart

"why vote donald trump out of office because he is a rotten person and a terrible president updated
we have to stop donald trump from winning a nd term here is why
he is arrogant he is corrupt he is incompetent he is a compulsive liar he tells ridiculous provable lies on a regular basis if you visit politifactcom youll find they rate  of what trump says as either mostly false completely false or pants on fire false all politicians bend the truth some of the time but trump is in a class all by himself
on the world stage he angers our allies and buddies up to brutal dictators who murder journalists and other people they see as political enemies trump is all in with that kind of thing yeah that is what we should be doing here in america is killing journalists who make me look bad
he is destabilized the middle east with terrible decisions like withdrawing from the iran nuclear deal moving the us embassy in israel to jerusalem and his abrupt withdrawal of us troops from syria predictably israel now fires missiles at iran and kills more palestinian protestors scores of kurdish fighters who helped us defeat isis have been killed and isis has regained strength and become a larger threat
he is destabilized the world economy and our economy with tariffs and trade wars he is utterly destroyed the us economy with his highly inept response to the covid pandemic more on that below the us stock market had been mostly treading water for almost  years before covid the dow jones lost a thousand points or  every time a trade deal with china fell through we just recently reached a partial deal that mostly benefits china trump cant negotiate his way out of a paper bag there have been manufacturing layoffs and farmers in the midwest have lost a ton of money as a result of tariffs weve been bailing farmers out with trump subsidies ie taxpayer dollars
in  trump promised to eliminate the national debt in  years before covid he had increased the national debt by  trillion and was on track to increase it by another  trillion if reelected if he gets what he wants the only way hell cut spending is on things like social security medicare and medicaid
trump is the most corrupt individual ever to serve as president the man is up to his eyeballs in scandals that have among other things put many people from his inner circle in prison and have gotten him impeached trump interferes in department of justice cases that affect him politically and recently he is been pardoning as many white collar criminals as he can the fact that trump currently has more than  business conflicts of interest alone is completely unacceptable trump is favors can be bought by world leaders foreign businessmen and members of congress drain the swamp trump is the swamp if hillary clinton had been elected and pulled  as much of this garbage everyone on fox and friends would be losing their minds
the trump white house is a  ring circus he is had a ridiculous turnover rate his administration is riddled with vacancies any intelligent competent individual who has worked for this administration has either been fired or run out the door screaming anyone who has or is working for trump will tell you he is a nightmare to work with his management style is to pit people against one another he gets some kind of sick pleasure from it like watching a dog fight do you think this is an intelligent style of leadership i sure as hell dont
ive never seen an administration embrace racism toward minorities and general bigotry with wide open arms the way the trump administration has between his asinine remarks about colored democratic members of congress going back to the countries they came from classic bigot speak or calling their districts rat infested hell holes his atrocious immigration policies and his coddling of white supremacists in charlottesville i can think of no comparison a partial travel ban aimed at preventing muslims from entering the country separating children from their parents to deter migrants seeking asylum appalling let is talk about his pardoning of former sheriff joe arpaio in arizona arpaio was convicted of criminal contempt for racial profiling for illegally detaining latinos he thought looked like undocumented immigrants and placing them in detention centers with horrific conditions he was ordered by a federal judge to cease and desist and he refused the only reason this guy isnt in prison is because he was pardoned by donald trump as a result this numbskull was able to run for us senate in arizona in  thank god he lost in the primaries but he did get more than  of the vote and while he was on the campaign trail he was endorsed by none other than vice president mike pence you cant make this stuff up there are no dog whistles anymore just bullhorns yeah were racist and howdaya like that
trump is environmental policies are a disaster he is rolled back all kinds of regulations to allow companies to dump toxins into our air and water he pulled the us out of the paris climate agreement despite the fact that  of climate scientists agree global warming is caused by industrial pollution and other human activities trump couldnt care less as long as he is making money for the people who fill his campaign coffers
trump is response to the covid pandemic has been an incompetent mess of epic proportions he was given intelligence on how badly the pandemic could affect the us in january of  the us got its first confirmed case on january th trump should have immediately regulated all air traffic coming in from china and europe he should have implemented massive testing tracking of people who were exposed and isolation of those who were infected south korea required travelers arriving from places like italy to be put in quarantine for  weeks he also should have invoked the defense production act to manufacture emergency medical supplies like masks gowns gloves and ventilators in case the virus got out of hand he did none of this instead he sat with his thumb up his butt for  months and consistently lied to the american people about the size and severity of the threat the number of potential cases and deaths and called covid the latest hoax from democrats trying to make him a oneterm president eventually by midmarch trump declared a national emergency there are now over  million cases of covid in the us and were probably going to see more than  deaths before it is all over trump continues to fail miserably to get testing distributed across the country to get emergency medical supplies to hospitals that need them and to consistently encourage people to take precautions like social distancing and wearing masks his latest rallies enforced neither he pushed states to reopen too quickly because he is afraid the massive economic damage his inept response has caused will cost him the election because trump failed to prevent much unnecessary spread of the disease congress has had to pass several stimulus bills adding trillions to the national debt the stock market has taken a hit and unemployment has been in double digits for several months
and let is remember a few reasons why trump is a revolting person in general this is a man who raised money for st jude is hospital for children with cancer and then used some of that money for his business instead this is a guy who mocked the disability of a handicapped journalist in front of thousands of people at a campaign rally this is a guy who has encouraged political violence at campaign rallies do me a favor knock the crap out of him for me will ya dont worry ill pay your legal fees yeah like you should trust trump to make good on a promise to pay anything this is grossly irresponsible behavior for anyone running for public office you dont encourage an angry mob to beat up people who disagree with their political views this is a man who was caught on tape bragging about sexual assault grabbing women by the py and kissing them without permission on and on and on
and i dont want to hear about how the economy had generally been doing well before covid couldnt care less trump is not the only person capable of presiding over a healthy economy and for the most part he can claim no credit for the economic strength we had before the pandemic
trump is the worst president we have ever had and an even worse person the country cannot survive  years of this creep vote him out",1

high crimes the impeachment of donald trump i dont think that donald trump should be impeached for throwing paper towels at the devastated victims of hurricane maria in puerto rico and telling them to have a good time i dont think that donald trump should be impeached because the bereaved widow of a dead us soldier says that trump told her that her husband knew what he signed up for i dont think that donald trump should be impeached because he has confessed that hed like to date his daughter in sum i dont think that donald trump should be impeached because he is a jackwagon  quite possibly the worst jackwagon ever to hold any public office in the united states he is our idi amin our own idiot amin minus the cannibalism at least as far as we know but is there any doubt that if maralago did offer human flesh on the menu trump would tout it as the best the very best human flesh ever available anywhere absolutely primo human flesh better than even what was for sale during the siege of leningrad but i do believe that donald trump should be impeached  for the numerous high crimes and misdemeanors that he has committed donald trump should be impeached because as doonesbury once said of richard nixon trump is guilty guilty guilty yes yes i understand that its tempting to say that trump should be impeached because it seems as though an evil clown from a stephen king novel has wandered into the white house its tempting to say that trump should be impeached because as president he is the woat worst of all time you dont have to take my word for this the american political science association apsa is a nonpartisan organization of political scientists after donald trumps first year in office a survey of the members of apsa named donald j trump the worst president of all time president andrew johnson who was impeached and almost removed from office ranked fifthworst president richard nixon who resigned after the us house judiciary committee voted for impeachment ranked th worst president bill clinton who was impeached by the house and then like andrew johnson won the conviction vote in the senate and remained in office was ranked th best read more wwwimpeachbookcom so yes i understand the impulse to say that trump should be impeached because he is a terrible horrible no good very bad president but when it comes to the impeachment of donald trump we can and we should be more specific than that donald trump is impeachable because the constitution of the united states says that he is for the reasons stated therein the us constitution says that the impeachable offenses are  treason  bribery  high crimes and  misdemeanors now i must concede that we have a president who will admit to nothing no collusion no obstruction if trump started to speak in farsi he would insist thereafter that there was no confusion if he accidentally dropped a nuclear weapon on philadelphia he would maintain that there was no destruction no confusion no destruction it doesnt matter in fact weve had a lot of truly awful public officials who have nevertheless insisted that they were as pure as the driven snow or in trumps case as pure as the orange glow it doesnt matter it hasnt mattered and it shouldnt matter it doesnt take a confession to find someone guilty of high crimes and misdemeanors in fact our own angry creamsicle is the capo di tutti i capi boss of all the bosses when it comes to impeachable offenses he is benedict donald historically impeachable offenses fall into these nine categories  divided loyalty  corruption  obstruction of justice  other abuse of power  campaign misconduct  sexual misconduct  tax evasion  conflicts of interest and  conduct unbecoming a public official particularly bad hombres as donald trump would call them have been guilty of two types of impeachable offenses on this list in trumps case you can find impeachable acts for all nine donald trump literally is guilty of every impeachable offense when a public official commits high crimes and misdemeanors or in trumps case revels in them what else are you going to do  ignore them look the other way close your eyes and hope that they disappear for those of us old enough to experience object permanence that just doesnt work anymore read more wwwimpeachbookcom how does donald trump stack up against the other miscreants who have soiled american history when you measure this scalawaginchief against all the other scalawags does his scala wag the most is trumps political stench  eau de trump his branded cologne  as putrid as theirs trump once tried to sell a trump cologne in a phallusshaped bottle the chicago tribune reported that it smelled like a strip club in sum is this president unprecedented look into it and you will find that donald trump has committed high crimes and misdemeanors that are as bad as or worse than every other official who has committed high crimes and misdemeanors therefore he should be impeached and removed from office qed and ill go one step further if you take an oath of office to uphold the constitution  as i did as every member of congress has done  then thats how you should see it too if you want to read all about it then you can buy the book  high crimes the impeachment of donald trump at wwwimpeachbookcom and as donald trump might say treasons greetings,1

offenbach 
den endorses european fund for building renovation
main goals significantly increase renovation rates strengthen europe is cohesion
the german energy advisor network den ev supports proposals for a european fund for building renovation we welcome the initiative of the renovation fund for all europeans campaign and support it says the chairman of the den dipling herman dannecker the initiative supported by over  institutions and companies from all over europe addresses the president of the european commission ursula von der leyen in an open letter and suggests that as part of an economic reconstruction program following the to set up a recovery fund for all european countries in the wake of the covid crisis which will release  billion euros a year
it is now important to combine measures for an economic recovery with an effective climate protection policy at the same time you have to take this opportunity to send a strong signal to all eu member states that the climate crisis can only be answered together said dannecker the campaign letter is not only addressed to the president of the commission but also to vice president frans timmermans who is also commissioner for climate protection to commissioner for energy kadri simson to commissioner for internal market and services thierry breton and to the commissioner for budget and administration johannes hahn
in their letter the signatories welcome the plans formulated in the socalled green deal to at least double building renovation rates in europe from the current  per year the creation of a recovery fund for all europeans to provide the necessary financial resources could be helpful the signing institutions and companies point out that the construction industry with its associated trades in eueurope represents around  of economic output and employs over  million people in this respect support for this industry always has a large social dimension
in order to achieve the desired climate neutrality in the eu by  renovation rates of at least  per year are necessary it is said after all the roughly  million buildings in the eu together consume more energy than any other sector this is accompanied by the highest co emissions a fund that frees up  billion a year could help meet the  annual renovations target in a first step the focus should be on public buildings such as schools hospitals or homes for the elderly but then subsidies should also be made available for lowincome households
as far as possible the fund should be available to all organizations involved in the financing and renovation of buildings it is important to issue the appropriate permits and make decisions quickly and efficiently the signatories also advocate the introduction of minimum standards for the renovation of buildings with a view to the climate targets for  these standards should be able to be adjusted upwards
for den chairman dannecker this is the right way not only to formulate and decide on climate goals at european level but also to implement them in practice in this respect the corona crisis may give us an opportunity to break new ground and unite bring new impetus to the climate protection debate",1

the rapidly spreading lung disease covid has been keeping society in suspense since midmarch this year at the latest in view of the intensity of the infection in neighboring european countries such as italy politicians in germany reacted with legally prescribed farreaching measures based on the infection protection act these measures led to restrictions in the areas of personal freedom economic life and to some extent also political life nobody doubts the fundamental sense of these measures in order to guarantee the right to health progressive actors in the form of trade unions parties initiatives eg for a corona parental allowance advocated social compensation for the social hardship associated with them from the outset and made corresponding demands on politicians and employers
another aspect in this context is to be emphasized at this event the development and expansion of scientific knowledge about the pathogen and the infectious disease it causes is also of political importance a wellfounded knowledge of essential epidemiological parameters eg the proportion of sick people prevalence mortality rate of new cases incidence density or number of reproductions forms the basis of political consideration when determining measures that are suitable for protecting health as well as social rights and freedoms at the same time it is important to raise public awareness of what is specific to the scientific methods used to calculate or more correctly estimate these parameters and then to use them in mathematicalstatistical models to predict the course of infection and its dynamics to be used
we want to talk about these two aspects with prof hanspeter piepho biostatistician at the university of hohenheim badenwurttemberg how do scientists actually model the infection process of the covid  pandemic what can these models say and predict with what certainty and with what accuracy how can the effectiveness of individual political measures to contain the spread of infection be estimated finally since any model stands and falls on the validity of its assumptions and the quality of its data what data is available what are the strengths and weaknesses of their expressiveness what improvements in the data basis would be desirable in germany
prof dr hanspeter piepho is a statistician in the field of life and agricultural sciences since  he has headed the department of biostatistics at the university of hohenheim he is a member of numerous professional societies such as the international biometric society and a member of the editorial board of numerous scientific journals such as the biometrical journal

"today i spoke at the california assembly is committee of the whole on the california state budget this unprecedented hearing allowed my colleagues and i to ask questions about the problems facing our state and discuss potential solutions following are my remarks from the floor
as a family that was struck with covid we know all too well the fear and uncertainty this virus can bring we struggled to find tests and i had to tell my daughter the virus that had ended her school year that was keeping us at home that had stopped the world in its tracks was now a part of our lives
the hardest part of the last couple months was that i could not promise my daughter that her dad would be okay
what i could promise was that no matter what i would love her and take care of her to the best of my experience knowledge and ability
it is also a promise that i made to every californian child the day i was sworn in
it is because of that promise that i rise to speak today
our stay at home restrictions have necessarily but artificially constrained supply
demand is still there
those who can still want to buy you can see it in the lines at grocery stores and in the thousands of delivery trucks running around our cities
people want to buy and we have to make sure businesses can respond to that demand by being able to among other things find trained and qualified employees
the deep severity and rapid onset of this recession has fallen hardest on those who can least afford it
these workers are relying on our social safety net in order to weather this storm
calworks is projected to see caseloads increase to  about a  increase
 of recipients are people of color
these numbers deeply disturb me and underscore the need to create options for calworks participants as we navigate these unchartered waters
i am however encouraged by the governor is decision to continue the flexible eligibility requirements in calworks a change that i have proposed to make permanent in ab 
i am disheartened by the nearly  million cut to the expanded subsidized employment program within calworks
we made similar cuts in our last recession and it greatly deteriorated the infrastructure of those programs
we will need to make sure we are able to teach the skills necessary to strengthen our essential workforce this should be coupled with ways to transition from high physical exposure jobs to working from home
i urge the governor to reconsider the drastic cuts to workforce development programs that can bolster our economic recovery
if we cannot promise our constituents a job right now at the very least we should be able to provide access to training so that when the time comes a living wage is no longer a dream but a reality
as chair of the revenue and taxation committee i am fully aware of the fiscal challenges we face
our general fund revenue relies heavily on personal income tax without safeguarding existing jobs and creating more opportunities for workers to earn a living wage we are making the choice to limit our economic potential and recovery
while i am thankful that the administration has not called for an increase in tax rates we are still being asked to limit the degree to which companies can use previously earned tax credits these are companies engaging in socially useful behavior like union work on environmental projects building homes for the poor and researching new technologies
if we are not in a position to honor those investments in the short term we should at the very least be thinking about how we can lift other burdens on the very businesses we will need to carry us into a more hopeful future
additionally we cannot talk about the importance of workforce development without including our k system
students in my district lack the devices and connectivity to engage in remote learning severely jeopardizing their educational opportunities and highlight the digital divide that exists in lowincome urban areas
i would be remiss if i did not also include the greatest obstacle currently facing the children of california housing insecurity
we cannot fully recover from this pandemic physically or economically until every family and child has a home
now more than ever we are aware of how many individuals and families are one paycheck away from being homeless
working towards a comprehensive solution including prevention emergency shelter and a permanent affordable home is imperative
i want to close by saying thank you to the speaker anthony rendon for having this hearing today
i like my colleagues believe being elected to office is a great responsibility
i value the work and insight of the lao and they are correct the legislature must guard its authority
i believe in this body the very people elected to it and the people that placed their faith in us and i believe our budget and its process should reflect our values
thank you",1

"i was disturbed to learn today that justin trudeau is political office has ordered nonpartisan government officials to do political damage control
according to media reports the prime minister is office ordered officials from global affairs canada to put pressure on former diplomat david mulroney who is now a teacher and researcher at the munk school at the university of toronto to have his public remarks on the trudeau government approved this pressure would be due to the electoral environment so that mr mulroney had to be very very careful
this is totally inappropriate and a blatant attempt by justin trudeau to muzzle a highly respected former career diplomat trudeau has demonstrated his tendency to silence those who speak freely
justin trudeau once said he admires china is grassroots dictatorship but that is not how it works in canada
it also raises questions about whether the prime minister is office has ordered government officials to speak with former ambassador to china and former trudeau cabinet minister john mccallum mccallum has made a number of inappropriate statements over the past year including about canada is extradition process and its encouragement of chinese foreign interference in the upcoming federal election
as mr mulroney said deterring citizens with foreign relations expertise from speaking freely is a fundamentally undemocratic concept i completely agree justin trudeau must be held accountable for the many occasions when he exploits canada is nonpartisan public service to serve his own political interests
justin trudeau had promised to do politics differently but it is clear that he is not what he announced",1

"midland daily news rep annette glenn rmidland who is vice chair of the house appropriations subcommittee that determines the state department of environment great lakes and energy is budget is hopeful that whitmer will reconsider assigning that investigation to egle
flood victims deserve a thirdparty independent investigation to ensure a fair and just conclusion for the thousands of families who have been devastated glenn stated in a news release late wednesday night
in april just three weeks before the two dams failed michigan attorney general dana nessel sued boyce hydro for allegedly illegally lowering wixom lake in  and  and killing thousands if not millions of freshwater mussels according to the lawsuit
was protecting mollusks more important than protecting the people of midland glenn stated in the news release and were snails more important than the people of sanford that is a question only an independent investigator can be trusted to investigate and answer
glenn said any conflict of interest must be eliminated and drew an analogy between the flooding and the flint water crisis
we did not trust the state department of environmental quality to investigate its own mishandling of the flint water crisis glenn said and after being in a lot of wet mudfilled basements this week i know it does not feel quite right to ask one of our own executive branch agencies to investigate whether the state shares any culpability for these devastating failures this situation clearly warrants an independent investigation
at wednesday is news conference in sanford where whitmer announced the investigation a reporter pointed out that egle itself is being sued by four edenville homeowners in a classaction lawsuit related to the breach of the edenville dam
are you confident that if they egle find themselves at fault that they would call themselves out on that would they report that to you the reporter asked whitmer
im confident that egle will do the kind of investigation that we all deserve and that we all expect and i will ensure that that happens the governor responded
glenn said other regulatory bodies and individuals independent of the state government have the technical expertise to conduct this investigation such as the us army corps of engineers
imagine how flood victims would react if the owners of the dams announced they were directing their own staff to conduct an investigation glenn said
sen jim stamas rmidland told the daily news he agrees with glenn that egle is not the right entity to be investigating the dam failures

"why vote donald trump out of office because he is a rotten person and a terrible president updated
we have got to stop donald trump from winning a nd term here is why
he is arrogant he is corrupt he is incompetent he is a compulsive liar he tells ridiculous provable lies on a regular basis if you visit politifactcom youll find they rate  of what trump says as either mostly false completely false or pants on fire false all politicians bend the truth some of the time but trump is in a class all by himself
on the world stage he angers our allies and buddies up to brutal dictators who murder journalists and other people they see as political enemies trump is all in with that kind of thing yeah that is what we should be doing here in america is killing journalists who make me look bad
he is destabilized the middle east with terrible decisions like withdrawing from the iran nuclear deal moving the us embassy in israel to jerusalem and his abrupt withdrawal of us troops from syria predictably israel now fires missiles at iran and kills more palestinian protestors scores of kurdish fighters who helped us defeat isis have been killed and isis has regained strength and become a larger threat
he is destabilized the world economy and our economy with tariffs and trade wars he is utterly destroyed the us economy with his highly inept response to the covid pandemic more on that below the us stock market had been mostly treading water for almost  years before covid the dow jones lost a thousand points or  every time a trade deal with china fell through we just recently reached a partial deal that mostly benefits china trump cant negotiate his way out of a paper bag there have been manufacturing layoffs and farmers in the midwest have lost a ton of money as a result of tariffs weve been bailing farmers out with trump subsidies ie taxpayer dollars
in  trump promised to eliminate the national debt in  years before covid he had increased the national debt by  trillion and was on track to increase it by another  trillion if reelected if he gets what he wants the only way hell cut spending is on things like social security medicare and medicaid
trump is the most corrupt individual ever to serve as president the man is up to his eyeballs in scandals that have among other things put many people from his inner circle in prison and have gotten him impeached trump interferes in department of justice cases that affect him politically and recently he is been pardoning as many white collar criminals as he can the fact that trump currently has more than  business conflicts of interest alone is completely unacceptable trump is favors can be bought by world leaders foreign businessmen and members of congress drain the swamp trump is the swamp if hillary clinton had been elected and pulled  as much of this garbage everyone on fox and friends would be losing their minds
the trump white house is a  ring circus he is had a ridiculous turnover rate his administration is riddled with vacancies any intelligent competent individual who has worked for this administration has either been fired or run out the door screaming anyone who has or is working for trump will tell you he is a nightmare to work with his management style is to pit people against one another he gets some kind of sick pleasure from it like watching a dog fight do you think this is an intelligent style of leadership i sure as hell dont
ive never seen an administration embrace racism toward minorities and general bigotry with wide open arms the way the trump administration has between his asinine remarks about colored democratic members of congress going back to the countries they came from classic bigot speak or calling their districts rat infested hell holes his atrocious immigration policies and his coddling of white supremacists in charlottesville i can think of no comparison a partial travel ban aimed at preventing muslims from entering the country separating children from their parents to deter migrants seeking asylum appalling let is talk about his pardoning of former sheriff joe arpaio in arizona arpaio was convicted of criminal contempt for racial profiling for illegally detaining latinos he thought looked like undocumented immigrants and placing them in detention centers with horrific conditions he was ordered by a federal judge to cease and desist and he refused the only reason this guy isnt in prison is because he was pardoned by donald trump as a result this numbskull was able to run for us senate in arizona in  thank god he lost in the primaries but he did get more than  of the vote and while he was on the campaign trail he was endorsed by none other than vice president mike pence you cant make this stuff up there are no dog whistles anymore just bullhorns yeah were racist and howdaya like that
trump is environmental policies are a disaster he is rolled back all kinds of regulations to allow companies to dump toxins into our air and water he pulled the us out of the paris climate agreement despite the fact that  of climate scientists agree global warming is caused by industrial pollution and other human activities trump couldnt care less as long as he is making money for the people who fill his campaign coffers
trump is response to the covid pandemic has been an incompetent mess of epic proportions he was given intelligence on how badly the pandemic could affect the us in january of  the us got its first confirmed case on january th trump should have immediately regulated all air traffic coming in from china and europe he should have implemented massive testing tracking of people who were exposed and isolation of those who were infected south korea required travelers arriving from places like italy to be put in quarantine for  weeks he also should have invoked the defense production act to manufacture emergency medical supplies like masks gowns gloves and ventilators in case the virus got out of hand he did none of this instead he sat with his thumb up his butt for  months and consistently lied to the american people about the size and severity of the threat the number of potential cases and deaths and called covid the latest hoax from democrats trying to make him a oneterm president eventually by mid march trump declared a national emergency there are now over a million cases of covid in the us and were probably going to see between  and  deaths before it is all over trump continues to fail miserably to get testing distributed across the country to get emergency medical supplies to hospitals that need them and to encourage several red states who never issued stay at home orders to instruct people to take precautions like social distancing and wearing masks he is now pushing states to reopen too quickly because he is afraid the massive economic damage his inept response has caused will cost him the election because trump failed to prevent much unnecessary spread of the disease congress has had to pass several stimulus bills adding trillions to the national debt the stock market has crashed and unemployment is expected to be in double digits for at least several months
and let is remember a few reasons why trump is a revolting person in general this is a man who raised money for st jude is hospital for children with cancer and then used some of that money for his business instead this is a guy who mocked the disability of a handicapped journalist in front of thousands of people at a campaign rally this is a guy who has encouraged political violence at campaign rallies do me a favor knock the crap out of him for me will ya dont worry ill pay your legal fees yeah like you should trust trump to make good on a promise to pay anything this is grossly irresponsible behavior for anyone running for public office you dont encourage an angry mob to beat up people who disagree with their political views this is a man who was caught on tape bragging about sexual assault grabbing women by the py and kissing them without permission on and on and on
and i dont want to hear about how the economy had generally been doing well before covid couldnt care less trump is not the only person capable of presiding over a healthy economy and for the most part he can claim no credit for the economic strength we had before the pandemic
trump is the worst president we have ever had and an even worse person the country cannot survive  years of this creep vote him out",1

"ive been getting a lot of feedback from yesterday is commissioners court meeting a lot happened under the topics of public health property tax exemptions and vote by mail elections community impactkaty carried several key points that i made during the meeting and i want to give more information here also
on the county judge is public health emergency declaration i voted against extending this till june th because both our county auditor and our emergency management coordinator testified to the court that it is not a necessary designation for fort bend county the county judge has said that he needs to keep it in place for obtaining funding from federal and state sources but our experts testified that is not the case the reason that this vote ended up as a  split is because an emergency declaration allows the county judge to continue transacting business and spending money without court approval i dont see an overwhelming reason why the spending authority of the taxpayers money isnt already restored to the full commissioners court commissioner meyers joined me in this vote because he believes the same thing the people of fort bend county need the freedom to get back to normal as they see fit the county needs to start getting back to normal also
during this same discussion the commissioners also heard from hhs director dr jacquelyn minter she agreed with my assessment that the county needs to immediately reevaluate the use and cost of some of the countyrun covid testing sites two of our locations are dramatically underutilized dr minter said that the county is working to restructure resources and tests to mobile sites to go directly to areas that need them ill be sharing that information as soon as the schedule becomes available
on property tax exemptions the court voted unanimously to enact the maximum homestead exemption were allowed to grant under texas law the county is exemption represents a  tax break on the value of your home and an additional k tax break for property owners over the age of  and the disabled the explosion of property valuations from the cad this year make this exemption worth more than ever and ill continue to visit and ask more taxing entities in fort bend county to grant larger exemptions like the county does right now only the city of katy has the same maximum homestead exemption for property owners and most muds dont have any homestead exemption at all
on vote by mail elections i voted against the motion to support full vote by mail elections and commissioner meyers joined with me for another  split vote i still remember when president carter and his bipartisan commission stated in  absentee ballots remain the largest source of potential voter fraud and i still believe that he is correct i also believe that both the texas supreme court and the us supreme court are going to put a halt to the attempt to expand vote by mail to the entire state of texas this year instead of focusing on the lawyers and courts on the theoretical your precinct  staff are working to come up with real solutions to the realworld priorities of voting this year more voting locations more elections workers more ppe and distancing at the voting locations if heb and walmart locations can handle thousands of people every hour so can our elections that is where ill be focusing my efforts so we can do our best to get ahead and get people voting confidently in the upcoming elections",1

"labor and cdu ignoring casuarina in move to the cbd
charles darwin university plans to push ahead with plans to build a new campus in the cbd and move most of the casuarina campus activities into the city notwithstanding strong opposition to the move
after months of talking with voters in the casuarina electorate territory alliance candidate i am yet to find a single person who supports cdu is plans without exception everyone i speak to about cdu is plans to move away from casuarina into the city thinks it is a terrible idea
the university plans to use a  million grant and borrow at least another  million to build a new campus on the old car park next to the cbd post office the gunner labor government supports the plans of cdu to move away from casuarina and into the city
the business case relies on increasing international students from about  to over  in just a few years notwithstanding covid has decimated international student travel the goals are unrealistic
president of the nt branch of the national tertiary education union darius pfitzner has been quoted as saying the university has demonstrated itself incapable of productively marketing into the international environment and that is really quite key to being able to justify the city deal
the result is that cdu will be saddled with a debt of at least  million which will add to the loss of  million a year that cdu has reported for the last three years in a row it is almost as if the cdu management are deliberately trying to bankrupt the university
cdu plans to move the faculties of education business and law indigneous futures arts and society creative arts and humanities children and community services engineering it and environment from the sprawling grounds of casuarina and palmerston onto a single site that is little more than  hectare the obvious question of congestion and stress on infrastructure in the city are apparent but the next question is what will happen to the mostly empty campus grounds at casuarina
cdu has been here before it was only a few years ago that cdu sold much of the palmerston campus grounds for a housing development the current cdu campus in casuarina is larger than the whole suburb of brinkin and would be a property developer is delight to turn into housing
much is made of the cdu city campus build and ongoing activity having a positive economic impact for the city and of course that is true what is not talked about is the ongoing economic detriment to the casuarina electorate the surrounding suburbs of alawa brinkin nakara tiwi lyons and muirhead will no longer be attractive places for cdu staff and students to live and shop
the previous town planners were right to place the university in casuarina on grounds that allow ample future growth moving cdu into the city is a backward step that will cause future territorians to scratch their heads and wonder why this current regime could be so shortsighted
if i am elected to represent the people of casuarina in the nt election i will fight to keep cdu at casuarina

i have mixed reviews on kaiser they can be really good or really bad i think it depends on the location the staff members and nurses are amazing they are always sweet and friendly and always willing to help i was hospitalized for  weeks while i was pregnant with my daughter and i loved all of the nurses they would all talk to me and keep me calm share there experiences with me went out of there way to keep me comfortable after i was discharged from the hospital i  was still staying there because my daughter was in the nicu and when they would see me in the halls they would ask about me and my daughter to see how we were doing i was staying as a courtesy stay and i had a nurse who would still bring me food to make sure i was taken care of the doctors werent as great some were but they were horrible at communicating with each other i had a new doctor every  hours and everyone had different opinions and different ways of doing things i had doctors who were trying to keep me in the hospital and another one who walked in trying to discharge me after multiple doctors told me i would be in for at least another  weeks and did not talk to the previous doctor or nurses for that matter and did not happen to notice the desats on the fetal monitor just a couple days later i ended up with severe hypertension in stroke levels and had to be induced for the safety of me and my daughter if we would have actually been discharged who knows what would have happened my daughter was born premature and was in the nicu for a month and the nurses and doctors in there were absolutely amazing they kept me involved in everything made me feel included allowed me to help with anything i was able to they took amazing care of my daughter and i am forever grateful to them that hospital also allowed me a courtesy stay so for  of the  weeks i was staying in the parent room or a hospital room so i could be close to my daughter above was all in the modesto hospital in kaiser there billing department sucks i cant tell you how many times ive received bills for extra charges even after confirming my copays beforehand they even coded something differently so they can say the charge was for additional testing that she did not receive some as small as  all the way up to charging me  when they should not have ive had multiple claims with billing and then theres manteca er i would not recommend them for anything i took my  month old daughter in for a head injury the doctor shined a light in her eyes and asked us questions and that was the extent of his exam he told us she had a slight concussion he did not think she needed a ct scan because there was a less then  chance she had a brain bleed and he did not recommend it he said he just wanted to monitor her for a couple hours and then we could leave they left us on a hospital bed in the hallway we were not even able to be in a room i figured her head might hurt so i asked the dr if she could have ibuprofen which he said yes i later found out that ibuprofen is extremely dangerous with head injuries and concussions because its a blood thinner and could causeworsen a brain bleed before she was discharged i asked if we should make a follow up appointment with her pediatrician and he said no not unless she started showing more symptoms he again told us he did not recommend a ct scan because it would expose her to radiation and she looked fine to him ive never had a concussion ive never been around someone with one so i had no idea what to do what they should normally do and your supposed to be able to trust the doctor a week later my daughter still had concussion symptoms so i called an advice nurse she was blown away she could not believe he didnt do a ct scan when the head injury was bad enough that she stopped breathing and passed out she then told me how dangerous ibuprofen was and she doesnt understand why he would tell us not to do a follow up appointment there should always be a follow up especially in that kind of situation she set a phone appointment with a pediatrician for the next day who said the same things the advice nurse had said so the er doctor didnt follow proper protocols did not do a full exam diagnosed a slight concussion when it was worse then slight and then gave me advice that could have killed my daughter so kaiser can be really great i love all of my doctors at the stockton location the modesto hospital lampd department was great except for the lack of communication and there nicu was beyond amazing and they can be really bad like manteca and not do there jobs and give you advice that could seriously harm you jenn griffin,1

"bristol music can survive at  metres
our vision for how with the right support bristol is independent music will survive
firstly let is talk about live streaming since lockdown began livestreams started arriving on social media from every angle and have become a source of shortterm fundraising for artists trying to bridge the gap between lost bookings and also provided invaluable direction for new artistic output while live streams have enabled us to support artists we love it would be naive to assume the already modest levels of engagement fundraising and artistsatisfaction they generate can endure a long period of social distancing
output from boiler room kexp glastonbury festival official and even radio  is insession have proven the value of videobroadcast live music but we should be under no impression that the current explosion of streams are any kind of replacement for real events will people still be diligently supporting streams once they are able to close their laptops visit friends and return to restaurants
 social distance subsidy for gigs
looking to italy and spain live music events have begun to resume with strict socialdistancing measures in addition to ideas like temperature checks on arrival facecoverings and compulsory guest registrations for retrospective contact tracing some indoor venues can operate at  capacity up to  guests for our independent venues in bristol even opening seven nights a week live music is not viable for  guests once events are able to resume at limited capacity we would like to see the creation of a subsidy fund to partmatch event organiser is ticket revenue
 studio sessions w professional video recording
anyone who knows how much time festival programmers spend trawling youtube understands that professional video content not athome livestreams is vital for new artists breaking out
we would like to see the funding for closeddoors invenue recording sessions to help local bands and djs record breakout video content and additionally provide work for sound engineers and videographers both creative industries also losing out to covid
 provision licence of outdoor spaces
bristol is small independent promoters have proven themselves agile and innovative when it comes to organising small capacity events in unusual spaces and now is the time to let these people shine we would like to see the creation of straightforward advice and guidance for event organisers wishing to produce seated day time events in new and unused spaces it is also an opportunity for closed businesses who would like to share their outdoor spaces eg warehouse forecourts car parks to help the arts survive
access to parks and already popular open spaces should not be restricted by any form of ticketing and areas which are already well used by the public should not be considered venues for paid events
 pay what you can
in addition to a social distance subsidy we believe that a paywhatyoucan model is essential for events operating at a reduced capacity we encourage event organisers to switch their ticketing to a paywhatyoucan model setting a minimum contribution per ticket if they wish headfirst will join other ticket outlets in offering paywhatyoucan next week
if anything positive is to come out of lockdown we hope it is a renewed community spirit and a genuine compassion for those in different financial situations with a fresh social understanding a paywhatyoucan system allows those with deeper pockets to help make live music accessible to all
we encourage those with questions ideas or concerns about the future of bristol is live events industry to attend tomorrow is online discussion at am hosted by the excellent thangam debbonaire and kerry mccarthy mp link in comments",1

disclaimer the following blog post includes discussion of social issues it is adapted from a coming book by william thomas harriman tom and is published on this page by david perry both page and blog have been strictly nonpartisan from inception unexpected wisdom how has the american identity formed itself during the past  years  from amidst an immense diversity of conflicting ideas and beliefs why has the clash of differing opinions led to patriotism and strength what is going on the idea that unity is strengthened by diversity may seem counterintuitive at first yet we have many examples of how this works in his book the wisdom of crowds james surowiecki describes compelling evidence that large groups of people possess an extraordinary power to solve problems when their judgment is aggregated and he shows that the more diverse the crowd the more efficient the solutions citing many examples surowiecki describes the conditions in which democratic decisionmaking does and does not work he tells us of the surprise of scientist francis galton when  participants in a raffle at a county fair submitted guesses at what the weight of a large ox would be after it had been slaughtered and dressed the analogy to a democracy in which people of radically different abilities and interests each get one vote had suggested itself to galton immediately  the average competitor was probably as well fitted for making a just estimate of the dressed weight of an ox as an average voter is of judging the merits of most political issues on which he votes galton wrote galton who expected to confirm his view that the average voter was capable of very little good judgment borrowed the tickets from the organizers following the competition he added up all the contestants estimates and calculated the average the crowd had guessed that the ox after it had been slaughtered and dressed would weigh  pounds in fact it weighed  pounds another example described by surowiecki is the story of the  loss of the us navy submarine scorpion which disappeared in the atlantic ocean the navy had no idea what happened to the vessel where it was or how fast it had been traveling mr surowiecki recounts the story as told by sherry sontag and christopher drew in their book blind mans bluff about how a naval officer named john craven assembled a diverse group of people  mathematicians submarine specialists and salvage men  provided them with a number of varied scenarios and asked them to offer their best guesses without benefit of contact with each other all they knew was the subs last reported location the group laid wagers on why the submarine ran into trouble on its speed as it headed for the ocean floor and the steepness of descent among other things craven built a composite picture of what happened and calculated the groups collective estimate of where the submarine was the location he identified was not a location specifically suggested by any members of the group but that is where it was the navy found the wreck  yards from where cravens group said it would be mr surowiecki proceeds to demonstrate the surprising consistency of this outcome in widely varied circumstances and he explains how groups work well in some circumstances better than others as we all know there are times when aggregating individual judgments produces a collective decision that is disastrous a riot for example or a stock market bubble interestingly he writes diversity and independence are important because the best collective decisions are the product of disagreement and contest not consensus or compromise an intelligent group especially when confronted with cognition problems does not ask its members to modify their positions in order to let the group reach a decision everyone can be happy with instead it figures out how to use mechanisms  like market prices or intelligent voting systems  to aggregate and produce collective judgments that represent not what any one person in the group thinks but rather in some sense what they all think paradoxically the best way for a group to be smart is for each person in it to think and act as independently as possible my coming book will offer practical guidance for local communities to utilize diversity and engage in effective problemsolving and decisionmaking stability in a crisis and the survival of freedom will require this wisdom tom you may watch for the next post on or about march  a note to new readers a description of this project an introduction to the coming book and several chapter drafts can be found at the main blog site wwwfreedomstruthcom,1

the resumption of medical activity in wards with unique medical specializations in the county is vital for the health of the people of suceava
it is an additional proof that through the reaction unit of the medical staff from all the medical units in the county from the ambulance from isu dsp the prefect is institution and through the involvement of the suceava county council management a long awaited thing is done citizens
and we must not forget in any case those who work in local administrations led by mayors who have done more than their duty in their actions of monitoring and supporting people in solitary confinement or quarantine at home or in designated quarantine units in actions to support the elderly etc
it may sound trivial now but given the magnitude of the effects of the pandemic in our county without the voluntary compliance of the vast majority of the population it would have been extremely difficult if not impossible to stop the exponential spread of the virus in such a short time
leaving aside the miserable media campaigns launched against bukovina against suceava and the people of suceava especially in the online environment but also in a large part of the central press we cannot forget the cynical attempts of some of the local politicians to on our suffering for all for political and electoral interests shame on them and god forgive them
there were three main stages of the return to normal after the peak of the pandemic lifting traffic restrictions in suceava quarantining the  localities and now resuming medical activity at the county hospital
let us briefly recall the film of events
on april  the management of the county administration returned from convalescence after hospitalization caused by infection with the new coronavirus sarscov
several intense and coordinated actions of the institutions with responsibilities for managing the effects of the pandemic followed
on may  at  pm following the request made by the county council management the road and pedestrian traffic was opened in the area of the county hospital
this decision was taken by the county committee for emergency situations after consulting the views on this issue submitted by the suceava public health directorate and the suceava county emergency hospital
after the consultations organized at the county council with the mayors of the  quarantined localities and following their reasoned requests after the confirmations of dsp and cjsu the president of the suceava county council supported the proposal to lift the quarantine
on the evening of may  the military ordinance number  was issued which ordered the exit from the quarantine of the municipality of suceava and the surrounding area consisting of eight atus
then after the two meetings of may  and  of cjsu respectively the technical meeting attended by the coordinator for covid management of the northeast region dr lucian indrei together with the management of suceava county hospital and dsp suceava representatives it will be possible to return in a first stage to about  of the activity of the suceava county hospital
the fight against this virus is unfortunately not closed at this time
in order to be able to resume our normal lifestyle as soon as possible we still need our sacrifice of all of us to comply with the requirements and restrictions imposed by the authorities during the state of alert
i trust my fellow citizens im sure theyll be just as responsible",1

"understanding that we were dealing with the first autochthonous case allowed us to prevent further infections annalisa a doctor who works in the badly affected municipality of codogno has identified the first covid patient in europe
on february  dr annalisa malara made one of those decisions that change the course of events the decision that saved the life of mattia maestri the patient she was treating and many others across europe mattia maestri a yearold researcher was the first indigenous case of covid in europe
annalisa works as an anesthetist at the codogno hospital in lombardy the hardest hit italian region and the first epicenter of covid in europe despite being young and sporty mattia was in very serious condition annalisa carried out various tests because she did not want to exclude any cause a priori after all the tests gave negative results she decided to test mattia for coronavirus
thinking back now annalisa realizes that raising the alarm immediately made it possible to introduce containment and prevention measures in italy and other european countries since then she and her colleagues have collaborated with doctors from other hospitals in europe and the united states international solidarity and scientific collaboration she is convinced of this are essential to tackle the pandemic we will defeat the virus she says with conviction
when mattia was diagnosed with covid his wife valentina was eight months pregnant i felt responsible for that patient says annalisa i explained to him that i would put him asleep and he made me promise that he would wake up because he was about to become a father after leaving the codogno hospital mattia spent  days in intensive care in a clinic in pavia annalisa considers him an example that the patient one in europe has survived is a symbol for everyone
i hope my story helps to make it clear that it doesnt matter who you are or the place you hold by working with integrity and passion you can always make a difference and i hope that europe will become more united and stronger because only by operating as a the only great nation we can cope with emergencies like this and win i truly believe in the european union

i am humbled to have the support of retired sheriff carl c ibsen for my campaign efforts carl served the communities of missoula county for more than  years with honor and integrity he was an independent sheriff much as he explains in his letter below i believe an independent sheriff is vital in supporting the legal and constitutional rights of all citizens i intend to manage the office of sheriff fairly with integrity and due process for everyone regardless of par  tisan affiliations thank you carl for your support and your wise words of encouragement and thank you for your service to missoula county  candidates who run for sheriff should be independent candidates with no allegiance to any political party their allegiance should be to the law and their constituents only an independent sheriff can be free from that allegiance travis wafstet is running for missoula county sheriff as an independent he believes that the sheriff should not be concerned with partisan support from either party because he does not believe that the sheriff should be beholden to anyone if one accepts support from a political party one can expect to be called on to repay that party for that support i support travis wafstet for sheriff he is an honest hard working and intelligent deputy sheriff who will serve us well take a look at travis website and discover what he has uncovered about the financial and other workings within the current sheriffs office travis supports fiscal responsibility and has found that sadly lacking within the current sheriffs administration travis believes in truth fairness treating others with respect and dignity this is also espoused by the current administration but seems sadly lacking according to many who are still within that community it was mentioned by the current sheriff at a recent candidate forum that travis does not have the requisite experience to be qualified to be sheriff travis does have such experience years as a dispatcher deputy detective asst chief of e missoula fire etc he has been integral in the budget management of the emfd as well as having experience in the grant writing area our current sheriff had no management experience and no administrative experience when he assumed the office of sheriff the office of sheriff is more administrative than anything else as well travis has been a deputy and was promoted to detective which necessitates the technical and investigative skills of advanced law enforcement work the current sheriff recognizes that since it is he who made such promotion to travis to now indicate that travis does not have those skills and abilities seems just a bit odd as well let us all understand that strictly speaking there are not any requirements to run for the office of sheriff other than not being a felon one does not even need a law enforcement background although both the current sheriff and travis wafstet have such experience by the bushel  do not whether you are republican or democrat blindly follow the lead of your party leaders or the friend of a friend who knows so and so who is a good guy and who was told check out the facts for yourself they are not hard to find travis website  wwwwafstetforsheriffcom  missoulian archives and other sources are readily available back to and before the previous election for sheriff i could provide many of such facts and details but they would be suspect by many because i support travis look it up for yourself then vote intelligently not blindly according to what your leaders d or r or a buddy tell you is the correct choice study research and understand in order to know then allow your choice to be one based on knowledge and its attendant logic travis wafstet for sheriff with more than  years as a law enforcement officer in missoula and as a retired missoula county sheriff i believe that the best and logical choice for sheriff of missoula county is travis wafstet he has my vote he will get the sheriffs office back on track to being the stellar agency it once was respectfully cc ibsen,1

every one of the democratic candidates remaining would make a better president than donald trump but the race for the democratic nomination is a fractured one it is not a straightforward narrative captured by glancing at a map and the process will not be decided by the simple horse race numbers in clickbait headlines that is never been our focus  our focus is on building a broad coalition to win delegates everywhere for months elizabeth has been near or at the top of the li  st of candidates that voters are considering for president according to the latest economistyougov poll  of voters across all age groups are considering voting for warren including  of selfdescribed liberals and  of selfdescribed moderates elizabeth is best positioned to unite the party and lead the democratic ticket to defeat donald trump our campaign is no stranger to being written off or counted out early but here is what we do know elizabeth has proven the doubters wrong before elizabeth is progressive effective and has lived a life that has prepared her for this fight with a strong organization of more than  staff on the ground in  states bolstered by a movement of more than  grassroots donors we are confident that as americans continue to get to know elizabeth they will see what we see every day elizabeth is the only candidate who can unite the party and defeat donald trump in november but the only way we will win this nomination is if everyone reading this digs deep and funds our  grassrootsfunded campaign can you help us keep moving forward chip in   or whatever you can to power this movement through the critical races to come,1

so finally this week we have our proof that the russia investigation was indeed real and justified and yet again we watch as the republicans shout that this is proof that it was not real and not needed and that the impeachment of the president is the actual crime so much so dangerous to america hides behind the myth that the republican party is no worse than the democratic party or that the corruption the party has embraced will end when the current president is out of off  ice its hard to get much further from the truth than this false equivalence our founders knew it wasnt enough to simply give congress equal power to ensure an american future free from wouldbe kings they knew without justice their new form of government that as one day lincoln would so correctly callby the people of the people for the peoplewould soon indeed perish from the earth so in the name of justice the founders created a third and equal branch of our government to ensure it to see the corruption that has taken hold of the republican party we need look no further than their obstruction of that system of justice so crucial to the american way of life to bring attention to how the republicans are misusing our system of justice to take control of our government from we the people and instead deliver it to their ultrawealthy benefactors this summer we created what is possibly our best blend yet penzeys justice what we quickly learned is that we were in no way ready to keep up with the worlds demand for justice we quickly ran out of the building blocks of this extremely wellreceived blend but as you read this the last steps are being accomplished the return of justice is now only days away please let those you know that justice is just around the corner we made this blend to get america talking about justice and how crucial it is to everything good about this country please share your thoughts on justice in all its forms in the comments below and if you have quick tips or short recipes for tasty goodness where justice shines please share those as well and yes maga my attorneys got arrested some day everything we are facing right now will be behind us at that point it will be time to figure out what to do with those who played a roll in corrupting and obstructing our system of justice mostly i agree with the wisdom of nelson mandela and what he did in postapartheid south africa document everything but then move on so many swept up in this were in situations where the balance of power was so against them that to blame them for what happened or to say they were the cause of it would be hopeless and lead to nothing good but in our rush to move on we cant let this same forgiveness apply to those who used their legal expertise to make these crimes happen for an attorney general or a former federal prosecutor to use their knowledge and experience gained from fighting crime to then fight on the side of crime is the equivalent of a doctor using their education and experience to further cancer there is great kindness at the heart of cooking but there is also the building blocks of what is right and what is wrong it really is time for those journalists on the front lines of all this to give no more ground to the presidents attorneys and to the republicans in congress who are using their professional skills to obstruct our system of justice what they are doing is every bit as much of a crime as the crimes they are covering up it is time for us all to hold them accountable justice is coming justice is good thanks for your support bill billpenzeyscom and if you want to help us do what we do no better way than to sign up for our penzeys voice of cooking emails free and closetofree spices recipes humanity and best of all you will be with the very first to know when justice is once again available for all to sign up just click this link httpspicespenzeyscomvoicehtml thanks,1

animal rights and animal welfare  know the difference there is a big difference between animal rights and animal welfare and it needs to be clarified the american veterinary medical association has taken a formal position defining the difference between the two labels animal rights vs animal welfare in their detailed policy on animal welfare and animal rights they state that they cannot endorse the views of animal rights groups heres a quote from their policy animal  rights is a philosophical view and personal value characterized by statements by various animal rights groups animal welfare and animal rights are not synonymous terms the avma wholeheartedly endorses and adopts promotion of animal welfare as official policy however the avma cannot endorse the philosophical views and personal values of animal rights advocates when they are incompatible with the responsible use of animals for human purposes such as food fiber and research conducted for the benefit of both humans and animals lets take a closer look at the fundamental differences between animal welfare and the animal rights philosophy animal welfare  animal welfare includes all animals whether used for food companionship or sport it is based on a principle of ownership of animals it reflects a common sense approach that animals should be treated well and that animal cruelty is wrong animal welfare standards and guidelines for animal use and management are based on sound veterinary and animal husbandry experience research and practices the avma views animal welfare as a human responsibility that encompasses all aspects of animal wellbeing including proper housing management nutrition disease prevention and treatment responsible care humane handling and when necessary humane euthanasia it also means animals that provide for human needs experience no unnecessary suffering animal rights  animal rights advocates and their groups believe in the ideology that there is no distinction between animals and humans they view animal ownership as exploitation and slavery the true goal of animal rights groups is to work for legislation and humane care only until all animals are no longer owned or utilized by human beings the ncraoa north carolina responsible animal owners alliance has described what animal rights groups are all about and their activities animal rights groups exploit our love of animals to work for various types of restrictive legislation limit laws breed specific legislation mandatory spayneuter as well as laws that are steps toward changing the legal status of animals as property and the animal rights movement is about control not animal welfare supporting legislation based on emotion and philosophical interpretation provides a platform in our legal system for incremental increases toward animal status changes lately we have been accused of being against the proper care and husbandry of animals this has happened because over the years we have been working hard to shed light on extremist animal rights groups we have exposed their activities and their agenda they are afraid the public will finally realize they are staging a dramatic impact on the rights and way of life of all americans since they are feeling threatened and are afraid of exposure they have fought back against us they have called us the bad guy and much worse while doing this they have conveniently blurred the definition of animal rights which both confuses and misleads the public they accuse us of being antianimal and against animals we have even been accused of hating horses and benefiting from killing them these accusations are not even close to the truth they are outright fabrications folks who are affiliated and work with protect the harvest have pets and a number also have horses and livestock we care about animals we care about their health and wellbeing we practice and support animal welfare while these outright falsehoods that have been launched against us create more work and some challenges for us it also shows that we are making progress in short we support animal welfare but we are against animal rights taking a stand against animal rights in no way means that we do not care about animals or their welfare we do care or we would not be investing time money and a whole lot of effort in educating the public about protecting our rights animal ownership agriculture and our heritage to stay informed sign up for our newsletter httpprotecttheharvestcomnewslettersignup,1

my town had some pretty strict bylaws about cutting down trees within town limits it is because we are part of a green belt meaning we have to maintain a certain amount of green space on our properties so for example you cannot just pave over your entire front lawn for extra parking spaces and any existing trees on the property must be left alone unless removal is absolutely necessary for construction purposes or safety concerns normally this is not an issue because we are  a fairly rural town the lots are pretty big plus having all the tree cover gives you a lot more privacy where this became a problem was in  when a massive ice storm hit it knocked out power for  or  days it also severely damaged a large tree on the front lawn of a acre lot just on the edge of town the man who owned the lot was a retired farmer about  years old who was a wellknown figure in the community he had built the house pretty far back off the road on his property and right next to a massive tree the same one that was now damaged by the ice storm spring came the tree died and looked like it was now in danger of falling on the house he had a local tree service come out to inspect it and they confirmed that if something was not done the dead tree could fall down possibly towards the house since there was a large split forming in the trunk as a result of the ice storm damage the tree service could not do anything without the man getting permission from the town first since the tree would need to come down trimming would have been fine but not cutting it down to make it more infuriating a neighbor literally next door was outside the town limits and therefore was free to clean up the storm damage however he saw fit the man went and applied for a permit to have the tree service come out and cut down the tree he also provided them with the quote from the tree service stating that it was a hazard the permit was denied by the town with no real reason given with a nasty thunderstorm in the forecast which he feared might send the tree crashing down on his house and the town not giving him permission to do anything about it he decided to take matters into his own hands and got a hold of a copy of the town is bylaws regarding this situation to see if there was a loophole somewhere oh boy was there ever a loophole the town had made a pretty serious mistake in writing their bylaws have you ever noticed how laws are always written in a really strange overcomplicated way well this is done on purpose to try and minimize any creative misinterpretations of the law our town however had written some of its bylaws in more or less plain english saying that it was illegal to cut down trees without approval from the town note the word cut in that sentence this is important after a quick phone call to his attorney this man somehow got a hold of a caterpillar dr which is a massive bulldozer for those of you who do not know probably borrowed it from the local gravel pit or something since he had that kind of pull in town anyways the next day when the bylaw officer knowing full well that the mans permit had been denied caught him cutting up the already fallen tree he stopped to investigate the man calmly explained that he had been using the bulldozer which was still sitting on the front lawn to tear up a section of dead grass so he could reseed it when he had accidentally bumped into the tree with the blade causing it to fall over and away from the house in the opposite direction from where it had been leaning obviously the town saw right through the cover story and knew full well that he had knocked the tree over with the bulldozer on purpose and slapped him with a fine for it he took it to court and won as the town is bylaw stated that cutting down trees without a permit was illegal but it said nothing about pushing them over with heavy earthmoving equipment the bylaw was changed and has since been repealed entirely and you are pretty much allowed to do whatever you want with your property as long as it maintains the green space requirements,1

"more than ever responsibility
puente madera collective article
noise too much noise surrounds us as ismael serrano is song says noise of patriots who wrap themselves in their flags confuse the homeland with the squalor of their caves noise of inquisitors they speak to us of freedoms it would be very easy to get into their game but we must wait for the storm of saucepans horns and provocations to pass to take to the streets en masse to defend civil and social rights against fascism of a new kind against the abuses of the elites the efforts of so many good people cannot be parked or forgotten that day will come we have no doubt but now in these deescalation phases we have no choice but to grit our teeth and apply the best medicine which is responsibility
in the face of lies hate and discrimination we can neutralize them with education culture inclusion and humility we have to raise awareness and educate youth with the future of our country arguing that what cannot be renounced is coexistence that they want to take away from us and save democracy that is our responsibility
in the covid pandemic we will not forget that when more people died and all the hands to help were few the opposition only thought from the first day of using it to overthrow the government this is not responsibility it is genuine and immoral folly there will be memory
of course we will continue to confront intolerance and fascism protecting ourselves with masks full of solidarity and optimism so that their hatred will not reach us we will practice social distance and get as far away from these provocateurs as we can and we will use the best hydroalcoholic solution available which is none other than good mental hygiene so that their lies cannot affect us
it is time to appeal to individual and collective responsibility in all areas which is why we must demand from the psoeunidas podemos coalition government greater cohesion unity and dialogue between the parties that make it up and then with the rest of those who supported the investment the more the government resists the more the anachronistic torquemadas will come to less it is fundamental and responsible that this government exhaust the legislature to the maximum to implement all the measures provided for in the social shield that will protect the majority of the citizens of this country
at the international level if its leaders and transnational organizations have learned anything from this pandemic responsibility must also prevail and turn the global economy upside down because the competition of all against all and the exclusive private profit of a few will not be able to save humanity from its selfdestruction from aggressive viruses from climate change from hunger from war they must be sensible implement social and economic policies so that the resources of the planet are used for the benefit of all and not of a handful of billionaire parasites seizing the moment for the abolition of this capitalist anarchy that takes us from nightmare to nightmare once and for all the time has come for greater european integration with financial and political institutions working in the same direction putting people at the center of their decisions urgently helping the most disadvantaged and vulnerable coordinating efforts in all countries to build public health systems well endowed with human material and research resources the responsibility of world leaders at this time is essential containing the geopolitical confrontation of the great powers transforming that unlimited competition into true cooperation their decisions must be aimed at carrying out more and better public policies that lead to less inequality on our planet
finally let is go back to the beginning of this article and be responsible faced with the rise of the virus of hate and intolerance let is apply the vaccine of our smile and our inclusion responsibility a lot of responsibility
let is all move forward together no one should be left behind cheers

taking issue with the manner in which state governments have subjected churches to more strident covid restrictions while allowing exceptions for bigbox shopping stores liquor stores and guns shops the rutherford institute is asking a federal court to ensure that churches are not being unfairly discriminated against in their efforts to worship in accordance with their religious beliefs
in a first amendment lawsuit filed in the us district court for delaware rutherford institute attorneys argue that gov john carney is state of emergency orders restricting indoor gatherings deprive delaware churches of the equal protection of the law the lawsuit rev dr christopher allen bullock v gov john c carney was filed on behalf of rev bullock the founder and pastor for canaan baptist church near new castle del who believes the state is restrictions are too intrusive overstepping the wall of separation between church and state
this is not about churches attempting to be rebellious rather these are religious institutions attempting to do what they do best which is to provide spiritual comfort to people who are living through difficult times said constitutional attorney john w whitehead president of the rutherford institute the government should not be in the business of micromanaging churches this establishes a dangerous precedent that will come back to haunt us at a minimum if bars and businesses can be trusted to operate responsibly churches should be treated the same

"post endorses retain link as elections supervisor
by the palm beach post editorial board
with critical statewide races in florida almost routinely decided by a hair it is crucial that elections in this county thirdlargest in the state be accessible efficient and accurate
in this regard elections supervisor wendy sartory link has been a pleasant surprise
link  has taken to the job with energy and creativity her first test came under extraordinary pressure a primary on march  as the covid crisis hit hundreds of poll workers did not show up but link scrambled to find volunteers to step in and though many sites were shorthanded and opened late only three did not open at all it was a monumental rescue effort
link has learned from that experience and like all of us expects even more disarray in the much busier november general elections so she has taken active steps to encourage voting by mail sending out mass applications for mailin voting providing each mailin ballot with a prepaid stamp to deter ballot harvesting by political operatives to cover for the aged workforce that is likely to skip election work this year link has recruited state workers and even high school students who have registered to vote that is smart
she has also purchased newergeneration ballot counters to enable more than one recount at a time replacing the creaky machines that could not handle the county is recounts in 
her opponent in the aug  primary paulette v armstead declined to be interviewed by the palm beach post editorial board but in written responses to a post reporter is questions accused link of openly and actively engaging in voter suppression mainly by opening early voting for nine days in march instead of an allowed  days
the accusation does not wash link added three earlyvoting sites in march and plans two more for august a better use of her department is money and staffing that will bring early voting closer to more residents
in a year and a half on the job she has proved herself far more than a quick study she is a steady hand on the keel in this stormy era of unpredictable and tumultuous elections

"pdn op ed we need a lot more new faces in the legislature
it is apparent gov lou leon guerrero is becoming the perfect example of the old adage power corrupts absolute power corrupts absolutely
the democrat and republican parties are totally dysfunctional as political entities no longer worthy of support by citizens as the only political parties on guam recognized by the guam election commission they exert so much control it is damned near impossible for an independent candidate or candidates of a new political party to run for office
both political parties have abandoned political ideology and embraced the cult of family politics you would be very hard pressed to find any common thread uniting the candidates in one party other than family and business relationships
another reason the governor has absolute power is the lack of a loyal opposition party i find it odd community advocacy groups are the only opposition
where are the republicans voices they are too busy playing family politics that is why the republican party continues to act as if the highest votegetting republican in the legislature three elections in a row sen mary torres does not exist
the democrats are no better considering the highest votegetting democrat candidate two elections in a row therese terlaje has been passed over for the title of speaker in favor of a politically wellconnected insider tina muna barnes was a low vote getter and appears to be focused on seeing adelup getting everything it needs to harvest the public purse to reward other politically wellconnected insiders with highpaying jobs and sweetheart contracts
with the covid pandemic it is not feasible to go doortodoor collecting signatures or hold public rallies which will put the voter initiative process on hold until further notice but that does not end the process to make sweeping changes to our government to make it more citizen friendly than politically wellconnected insider friendly
until the pandemic is over we citizens are going to have to work very hard to elect  or more new senators willing to put public service over pork barrel politics that is the only way we will increase the number of senators from  back to  go to a parttime legislature to dramatically increase the pool of potential candidates for office and eliminate the primary election which serves primarily as a major barrier for new faces to challenge incumbent politicians
and more importantly in light of the actions we are seeing done with under the pandemic excuse we must have senators willing to introduce and pass the corrupt practices act that will allow citizens to take legal action against government officials and employees who break laws rules and regulations in such a manner as to cost taxpayers money
remember the wise words of albert einstein who said the very definition of insanity is to keep doing the same thing over and over again expecting different results the election is coming and a chance to change that paradigm forever by electing  or more new faces to the legislature and give them a chance to prove if they are going to serve the people or serve politically wellconnected insiders
this coming august we get a chance to send a message to politicians that the pork barrel buffet is closed we do that by electing  fresh new faces to the legislature and vote out ten politicians that have made serving the needs wants and desires of adelup and politically well connected insiders more important that serving the needs of the people

"zimmermann asked kulfas for more benefits for the chaquena smes
national senator victor zimmermann participated in the remote meeting of the commission on regional economies social economy micro small and medium enterprises where he requested benefits for the economic activity of chaco
at the meeting the minister of productive development matias kulfas reported on the measures adopted in the framework of the covid virus pandemic and the chaco senator raised specific claims from chaco businessmen for whom these measures are not enough
the complementary allocation is a very good measure but it has problems in its implementation warned the chaco legislator coinciding with senator maurice closs of misiones who also raised his objections there are several particularities to resolve such as the issue of inflation that is not covered and excludes many smes zimmermann said
in another order of things the senator from chaco asked that the expiration dates of the taxes that comprise the moratorium for mipymes in force in the framework of the pandemic be extended and that it contemplates tax fiscal and debt debts social security
although the term of adhesion was extended to june  the debts included are those that expired on november   so i think it should include debts due until april  of this year he explained the senator chaqueno
finally victor zimmermann recognized the importance of these meetings in which we can present the needs of our provinces and adhered to the challenge of working within the framework of the asymmetries of northern argentina",1

"racial trauma is real
racial trauma a form of racebased stress refers to people of color and indigenous individuals poci reactions to dangerous events and real or perceived experiences of racial discrimination such experiences may include threats of harm and injury humiliating and shaming events and witnessing racial discrimination toward other poci although similar to posttraumatic stress disorder racial trauma is unique in that it involves ongoing individual and collective injuries due to exposure and reexposure to racebased stress comasdiaz l hall g n neville h a  racial trauma theory research and healing introduction to the special issue
how does one deal with racial trauma while trying to survive a global pandemic i will not pretend there are straightforward solutions and ways to cope having to wake up to news of friendsfamily losing loved ones to covid while being inundated with a new story about a black manwoman being abused falsely accused or even murdered simply because they are black is beyond overwhelming it is infuriating
what i can say is that it is okay to be sad angry feel anxious or even afraidit is okay to disconnect from the news and social media to temporarily have a moment of peace without all of the reminders of the constant racial injustice and ever raising death toll reports
it is okay to not be okay
this is a time to be sure that your self care and self love regimen is in place and effective you may also find the support and comfort that you need in your loved ones

"covid among top officials of the regional council and regional state administration confirmed by laboratory
hushing up the truth new infections
who benefits from spraying covid in dnipro and the region
surrounded by top officials of the region revealed  cases of coronavirus
state expertise
this was announced at a press conference by the head of the state institution dnepropetrovsk regional laboratory center of the ministry of health of ukraine oleksandr shtepa
on may  disaster medicine employees delivered  blood samples to our laboratory marked with the designations vip and vip i cannot disclose the personal data of patients but i think it will not be difficult for you to guess whose samples they were after on the evening of may  we learned the result of a double test the vip patient was infected with the coronavirus which we reported to the relevant services
after that the dnepropetrovsk regional council and the regional administration began to draw up lists of contact persons information about this became the property of the media
over the next day we were asked to doublecheck the data several more times says alexander shtepa head of the laboratory center samples of socalled contact patients also began to arrive some of them also tested positive for covid
in total  employees of the regional council and the dnepr regional state administration were tested of which  showed a positive or questionable result medical practice shows that a doubtful result actually means the presence of infection and patients need to be under observation
the leaders of the region frightened by the data tried to avoid publicity starting on may  accusations and threats against the employees of the laboratory center began to be heard then the work of the institution was paralyzed by checks and then regional officials spread false information about the dismissal of the head of the center
to clarify oleksandr shtepa personally delivered samples for testing to the base reference laboratory in kyiv which is the only one in ukraine that is accredited to conduct pcr tests for covid
an independent state examination the data of which is recorded in the protocols confirmed the complete correctness of the experts of the dnepropetrovsk regional laboratory center
on the evening of may  following the rules of transportation i delivered samples of vip and contact persons to the base reference laboratory in kyiv said oleksandr shtepa by the evening of may  the reference laboratory officially confirmed our data and established  facts of infection and several more socalled doubtful
the head of the dnepropetrovsk regional laboratory center calls to stop the attacks of regional officials on the institution and protect professionals who work in incredible conditions to protect people is health
you can fully trust the results of our testing stressed alexander shtepa head of the laboratory center after all we are well aware of the responsibility that lies with us we have worked are working and will continue to work  hours a day for people for their safety",1

what manner of persons ought we to be it would be foolish to ignore the obvious to fail to look directly at the madness and mayhem the racism and anger the anarchy theft murder and general evil that are engulfing our country  and we havent even finished with the wuhan virus yet indeed the massive restriction fears loss of jobs and isolation from that have risen to the boiling point where the pressure cooker has finally popped unleashing both peaceful protests a  nd violent anarchists running free  with authorities seemingly unable and many unwilling to stop it indeed many socalled leaders like obama are openly supporting and praising the violence theft and anarchy everyone has opinions theories accusations and the media is having a heyday fueling the flames with lies and highlighting any criticism it can find or make up as americans we are at least tempted to be drawn into the fray as social media will quickly reveal with people who are or who claim to be christian spewing forth with as much anger and hatred as anyone else  bringing shame to the name of our lord and his church others are understandably seeing signs that look like what we think the end times will look like and while thats exciting it also means that very hard times will be coming upon the church as weve discussed in recent weeks i want to remind us now of something our lord said and said often  in different ways and to different people  but a clear message nonetheless speaking of the end times aka day of the lord and that day jesus said matthew  but of that day and hour no one knows not even the angels of heaven but my father only matthew  watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour in which the son of man is coming matthew  you know how to discern the face of the sky but you cannot discern the signs of the times mark  but of that day and hour no one knows not even the angels in heaven nor the son but only the father acts  it is not for you to know times or seasons which the father has put in his own authority so our lords message is clear  while we are to be on the alert and watch for his coming we dont know and we wont know when in fact in one of his teachings jesus says luke  therefore you also be ready for the son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect so what does he mean when he says be ready be on the alert watch and similar exhortations does he mean that we should spend our time looking into the sky anticipating his coming no in fact quite the contrary instead of focusing too much on that jesus said occupy till i come or do business until i comeluke  jesus is telling us that he expects us to continue doing his business until he returns much as he said in acts after the disciples asked if he would restore the kingdom at that time right before he ascended acts  it is not for you to know times or seasons which the father has put in his own authority  but you shall receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you and you shall be witnesses to me in jerusalem and in all judea and samaria and to the end of the earth so while it certainly could be true that we are now entering the last days and we should always be alert for that we must nonetheless continue to do the lords business  obediently and faithfully representing him and being his witnesses on this earth which leads me to ask the question that peter asked of the church after describing the ultimate end of this age  peter  therefore since all these things will be dissolved what manner of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness indeed knowing how everything will ultimately turn out we ask ourselves what manner of persons ought we to be thats a great question and we should give it serious consideration especially when there are so many things coming at us pulling us this way and that even demanding that we react or respond on their terms in some way and whether we sense it or not satan is busy causing and manipulating our present multiple crises to tempt our fallen nature to react as he wants us to but what manner of persons ought we to be according to our lord and his word what manner of speech should be coming through our lips what manner of words should we be typing in messages emails and social media what manner of actions should be taking what manner of thoughts should we have our speech words actions and yes our thoughts are open and bare to our lord and they should all reflect and represent him  so what manner ought they to be what do our bornagain spirits lead us to be as opposed to our flesh there are many answers to this question and really they are no different from the basic characteristics that should describe us at any and all times but considering the somewhat unique pressures were experiencing these days lets focus on a few that may be particularly salient so what manner of persons ought we to be  we ought to be righteous as we walk in jesus steps matthew  blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven have you ever put yourself in this verse romans  and do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin but present yourselves to god as being alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness to god  corinthians  for he made him who knew no sin to be sin for us that we might become the righteousness of god in him the great exchange the definition of righteousness is difficult to pin down but we know that it speaks to integrity virtue purity of life rightness correctness of thinking feeling and acting in scripture as it is applied to our lord there is the meaning of perfection as well thats why we should never attempt to rely on our own righteousness but on christs which is imputed to us at the same time jesus says that we should hunger and thirst for righteousness meaning that it should be our conscious passionate desire to live righteous lives in addition paul clearly instructs to not allow ourselves to be instruments of unrighteousness but on the contrary we should be gods instruments of righteousness so with selfexamination in light of our current circumstances can you say that your words actions and thoughts are predominantly righteous before your god shouldnt righteous be central to the manner of persons we are does it describe you but james gives us a strong warning regarding righteousness particularly relevant in these days james  for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of god so if we truly hunger and thirst for righteousness we must exercise selfcontrol with our anger  and that may be a serious problem for us these days  so pray  what manner of persons ought we to be we ought to be faithful and obedient faithful to our god and obedient to the principles and dictates of his word in one of his letters to the churches in revelation jesus said revelation  be faithful until death and i will give you the crown of life faithful  trustworthy reliable  even in the face of the most severe circumstances be faithful until death jesus said and i will give you the crown of life many people believe that we the church may be facing those days very soon and even if we arent yet we are still required to be faithful and obedient in fact if we claim to love our lord jesus we must be obedient john    if you love me keep my commandments  he who has my commandments and keeps them it is he who loves me and he who loves me will be loved by my father and i will love him and manifest myself to him  if anyone loves me he will keep my word and my father will love him and we will come to him and make our home with him so are we being faithful and obedient even in our thoughts as we watch the news i confess that i struggle there and really need to continually call on the strength of the holy spirit to help me  what manner of persons ought we to be we certainly ought to be loving in our words actions and thoughts since our god is love  john   we certainly must manifest that love in our own lives as well even in the most extreme ways luke  but i say to you who hear love your enemies do good to those who hate you  bless those who curse you and pray for those who spitefully use you love bless and pray  for your enemies for those who hate and curse you for those who spitefully use you certainly those can only come from our newborn spirits empowered by the holy spirit within usbut since our lord commands it then we know that we are able to do it and by the way the word for love here is agapeo which as we know is not so much an emotional love as one of thought and decision it is very strong but does not indicate emotional attraction ok there are many more things we could point to as being necessary characteristics of the manner of people that we the church ought to be but i want to close this brief list with one that can be seen as including them all  be holy holy the word means separated sanctified dedicated set apart to god for god and that is clearly what our god expects of us we are to be holy the church is to be holy we are to be separate from this world because we have been dedicated to god at the same time we are to live in and have impact and influence on this world as jesus prayed to the father in john  yet the world is not to have influence over us look at what gods word says ephesians  he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love ephesians  so that he might present her to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that she should be holy and without blemish  peter  but as he who called you is holy you also be holy in all your conduct  because it is written be holy for i am holy  corinthians  therefore come out from their midst and be separate says the lord and do not touch what is unclean and i will welcome you what manner of persons ought we to be we ought to be righteous obedient faithful loving and holy and were not just looking at outward actions and words but also inwardly how we think and you know that is the most difficult thats why we frequently use davids great prayer at the end of psalm  psalm  search me o god and know my heart try me and know my anxieties  and see if there is any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting search me o god dig all around in my heart and my mind test me if necessary and reveal to me any unholy unrighteous unloving disobedient unfaithful wicked way in me so i can confess to you and be forgiven and then lead me in the right way your way your path the everlasting way of eternal life if we are to be like this what words should come out of our mouths and off our fingers in letters texts emails and social media ephesians  let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth or fingers but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment so that it will give grace to those who hear or read and our thought life  what should that be like philippians  finally brethren whatever things are true whatever things are noble whatever things are just whatever things are pure whatever things are lovely whatever things are of good report if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthymeditate on these things so in light of all the chaos and anarchy we are experiencing as a people all the cowardly foolish and evil leaders and violent thugs all the fearmongering and racist hatred being fueled by the media with all the biblical truths and miraculous new spiritual births all the loving brothers and sisters of every color and ethnicity in the church  not to mention our perfect loving heavenly father and our lord jesus christ  in light of all that and more what manner of persons ought we the church of jesus christ in the midst of this world be and finally do not allow the very tangible reality of the evil violence and plague of our day to cause you to be blind to the presence power and sovereignty of our god do not allow what screams so loudly for your attention because it is visible to give you tunnel vision myopia that you miss the schemes of satan and fail to do battle in the power of our lord broaden your vision because gods great plan is still on track  points for prayer  where there is chaos pray for and act in the opposite way peace and order  where there is hate pray for and act in the opposite way love and tenderness toward others  where there is division pray for and act in the opposite way unity and compassion  where there is deception pray for and act in the opposite way honesty truth and transparency  where there is fear pray for and act in the opposite way security in god and active strong faith  where there is greed pray for and act in the opposite way contentment and generosity,1

especially in view of the national state reflexes at the beginning of the crisis european solidarity is now extremely important not a single country in the eu not even germany can cope with the enormous challenges and the almost unstoppable economic crisis on its own as the largest and economically strongest country germany must also make its active and solidary contribution to ensuring that the eu can face the challenges of the pandemic the eu is ability to act also largely depends on the willingness of the german government to act
germany is partner countries in the eu expect an active and cooperative german european policy particularly from the german eu council presidency

on july st  germany will assume the chair of the presidency of the council of the eu in the light of the current circumstances the german government will have to deal primarily with the sarscov pandemic and its consequences for the over  million citizens of the eu apart from this numerous pressing topics and unresolved questions that were urgent on the prepandemic agenda still call for immediate attention such as in refugee policy climate policy the incomplete finance union as well as the sustainability of the rule of law
precisely in the light of the nationstate reflex that characterized many states responses at the onset of the covid crisis is european solidarity again in tremendously high demand no member state of the eu germany included can face the enormous challenges and the barely containable economic crisis alone as the economically largest and strongest country germany must further offer an active and solidarity contribution in order to ensure that the eu can rise to meet the challenges of the pandemic the eu is capacity to act also depends crucially upon the german government is will to act partner states in the eu expect an active and cooperative european policy from germany both now and particularly in the german presidency
at our annual conference on european politics which takes place this year in digital format we speak with representatives from political office academia policy advising and civil society from all over europe in order to analyze the current crisis as well as to discuss the future of the eu both controversially and constructively

"fontana vs zaia
in recent days the lega tries with poor results to make people believe that the covid emergency has been best managed by the lombardy region indeed even better than any other region
in fact alas we had to hear several times a selfcelebration of fontana and gallera that invited everyone to be inspired by an elusive modellolombardia
ok so summing up
they sent sick people to nursing homes for the elderly rsa giving rise to a chain of infections that has drastically increased the number of deaths
have imposed the use of masks without them being available so they said just in case to replace them with scarves in short the same thing
they paid for the tampons with rates ranging from  to  euros and proposed a refund of  euros only in case of positive coronavirus consolation prize
they celebrated ahead of time for the construction in record time of the hospital in the milano fiera area which cost  million euros money obtained through private donations which should have had capacity for more than  beds
unfortunately we know that the structure was used only for  patients privileged i would like to say because it seems that according to fontana this hospital will soon be dismantled
finally just to understand what kind of people the region is in the hands of we report the latest gallera statements regarding the transmissibility index
with index rt  what does it mean it means that to infect me you have to find two people infected at the same time because it is at  and that means it is not that easy to find two infected people to infect me
in short according to the lombardy councilor for welfare ahahahah if an infected meets a healthy one an infected vehicle is given birth he has come to make it a matter of proximity and not of statistics based on the measures taken against the coronavirus he managed to think of it much more complicated than it actually is this is much more serious than incompetence because it does not take medical or mathematical preparation to understand what the disease transmissibility index is it would be enough reason
so yes come on apart from these little little things let is all be inspired by the lombardy model
by virtue of this i came to the conclusion that if the lega really felt the urgent need to enhance a territory it managed it could have boasted of the veneto model which on the other hand would almost seem to be overshadowed
indeed veneto whose governor is luca zaia was one of the most affected regions together with lombardia piemonte and emiliaromagna but already today the veneto region has managed to touch zero contagi
so let is try to explain this positive model which i hope can inspire not only our regions but also other countries
when towards the end of february the first cases of coronavirus were confirmed zaia had all the citizens of the red zones do tests and then repeat them on the same  weeks later
thanks to this modus operandi it was discovered that almost  of the positives were asymptomatic and seeing that the number of patients continued to increase he had a new laboratory opened to be able to analyze many more swabs per day
in doing so through a proportion between population density and number of swabs performed veneto is the region that has most controlled its citizens and consequently protected free of charge eh
another very important thing to say is that all this was possible not because zaia is an expert virologist but rather he did a very simple thing listen and be advised by experts and then act accordingly
even with regard to the economic part he behaved responsibly in fact all citizens have already been assessed the request for the longawaited redundancy fund
in short luca zaia without having to emulate his colleagues who always try to whimper blaming palazzo chigi bowed his head and worked with seriousness a skill now very rare to find in our ruling class showing himself up to a emergency of this magnitude i dare say one of the best political figures in the country
who knows maybe one day i hope not very far away at the head of the league there will be a competent person aware of what he is saying without repeating the usual slogans catching votes and who knows to do
in fact zaia has also shown that he knows how to build a good team around himself so the reconstruction of the party could start with a good cleaning so much so it has already been understood that he showmen and shopping lists cit are not very good at it
it would be like reconstructing the face of a party that has lost all credibility in front of the whole world especially since according to bbc the leader of the matteosalvini league is together with the brazilian president bolsonaro and the american president donaldtrump among the politicians who spread more fakenews during the pandemic period the service titled politicians false statements have been debunked aired on april  
the basis of democracy especially the parliamentary republican one is the balance of forces between the opposition and government for this reason i hope that zaia will be able to take over from salvini as soon as possible in order to guarantee a competent opposition that in these extraordinary cases knows how to put aside the careerist spirit to make room for that of collaboration

alberta is it time to consider life without canada i was born into a working generation that was just  years old within our peaceful borders it may be difficult to believe that it was a bloody fight to get there it caused arguments heated debates fist fights threats and deep divisions among familys but ultimately it was the women that decided the vote when the government of canada promised mothers the child tax credit money in your hand every month to feed your c  hildren the choice was easy and obvious it was a secret ballet and i suspect many of the women of the time never told their husbands fathers and grandfathers where they placed their x but shared a secret comforting smile with their children when they heard the results i am obviously referring to the vote for newfoundland a country at the time to join canada looking back it was one of the best decisions my parents as country of newfoundland citizens ever made newfoundland was in economic turmoil and had few logical choices but with a vote of  to  it took heart and courage to make the decision to join confederation a country that became a province but what if the opposite occurred what if a province became a country what if alberta was a country do we have the wealth and know how to make the choice that other provinces dont have could we bring saskatchewan and north eastern bc all the way to the coast with us would they join us is it possible can it legally be done should it be done i dont consider myself a separatist i am loyal to the maple leaf i have sworn to protect my country and i have proudly saluted my flag while serving my country so i will call myself a realist instead i believe it is time for alberta to start the open discussion on what life would look like without canada relationships always end in a divorce when one side seems to give more to the relationship than is being received is that the relationship that we have with the rest of canada do we give more than we receive there is an energy east pipeline its apparently very efficient and stocked with alberta dollars flowing directly to ottawa for redistribution to the rest of canada the amount we sent down the oneway line last year is estimated at  billion what do we get for that when we get the invoice for services rendered from ottawa what in on the invoice besides pay this amount when i spend  bucks on something i want to know what i am getting if i was to spend a  with the big b that being a billion verses a buck i would really want the know what i was paying for certainly national defense and a federal police force quickly come to mind both very important from a safety and security perspective with a federal defense budget of  billion annually and a rcmp budget of less than half a billion we may be over contributing a federal transportation board for all the trucks we see on the highways moving oil to the rail and supporting our infrastructure come to mind the railway to get our oil to the coast aviation the dying cbc that we watch once a week for  months a year on saturday nights or special events immigration because thats going so well the federally financed coast guard isnt so important to a land locked province but we would give anything for a route to some beach front west coast property right now the point being i cant think of one thing that canada does for us in our relationship with ottawa that we cant do ourselves and do better trudeau did take a step towards building the trans mountain pipeline by having the federal government owe it by having ownership he can declare it a project of national interest in the house of commons vote on it and push it thru no matter what the courts say it is an option one he has yet to exercise my thoughts are he is waiting on cannabis sales if that will sufficiently contribute to stock federal coffers to pay for the many social programs he has bouncing around between his ears alberta oil revenue will not be required for reelection i suspect junior doesnt have the same testicular fortitude of his father to force built the pipeline he will not look into the camera and say the famous words of his father when discussing a few terrorists just watch me unless of course there is an opportunity for a selfie with a beaver cannabis in hand while in a kayak then the caption could be just watch me and the beaver but never said with the same intent pipe lined energy or vigor so that leaves the people of alberta  billion short with another invoice for  plus billion coming and a growing deficit to leave our children is it time for our leadership to nudge the federal decision making process or even test if there is serious decision coming by openly discussing options for alberta we could temporarily stop these transfer payments and have the discussion on what alberta would look like without canada can we make it on our own we already attract some of the best and brightest to our universitys and schools to study and to do research i believe that the options are endless for alberta to attract people and to lead the world in science research clean energy and economics there is nothing that albertans the ones born here and the ones who have earned the right to say that i am from alberta cant do we just have a different attitude than our east  west cousinswe have the strong backs minds and hearts if we keep our own money we have the time resources and people to do it i am all about helping my neighbor but when i need a helping hand and my neighbor turns his back on me my desire to contribute to my neighbors hospitals schools and general upkeep of his lawn diminishes alberta has attracted the best and the brightest from all parts of canada for years the question on alberta job sites is where do you live the reply being i live in edmonton calgary grande prairie or fort mcmurray but i am from nova scotia saskatoon montreal toronto or vancouver this province was built by canadians from all colors backgrounds and beliefs but it may be better to have its future maintained and build solely by albertans lets have the conversation lets send the message to our neighbors lets have the plebiscite,1

part  of  effort for privatization of medicare before diving into part  i want to make it clear that the nrln knows how important low cost ma plans are to retirees we are not saying dont buy one but those in congress who have supported subsidizing them also push the premium support plan and it calls for phasing out ma plans and forcing retirees to choose another nonsubsidized private plan or switch back to traditional medicare plan which likely will look much differe  nt therefore our first goal is to make sure that current and future ma plan enrollees maintain their eligibility to switch to traditional medicare and second that the nrln lobby to protect or grandfather ma plan enrollees from losing the low cost advantage they can buy now ma plans have been the private plan trojan horse designed to sneak privatization in and medicare out now on to part  of our three part series in april  the centers for medicare and medicaid cms broke the mold when it announced it would expand how it defined primary healthrelated benefits for medicare advantage ma plans cms will increase taxpayer funded capitation payments to ma plan insurers by an average of  percent about  billion in  allowing them to offer more benefits thats well above the  percent bump cms initially proposed and higher than the  percent increase for  these are federal door prizes awarded to new ma plan enrollees by hhs management hoping the ma model will reduce health care costs this is shocking because it is not an incentive program and is very expensive to taxpayers simply a gift to insurers wanting to lure new enrollees during the  open enrollment period new ma offerings will include safety adaptations to a patients home air conditioners for seniors with asthma transportation to medical appointments or an emergency room healthy groceries and homedelivered meals etc these added benefits are not available to traditional medicare participants if these taxpayer benefits are proven to lower costs why would they not be offered to the  million in traditional medicare data from the  medicare trustees kaiser family foundation and cms reports show that in  the average cost for each of  million enrollees in traditional medicare part a amp part b was  the  million ma plan participant costs for medical services a and b were  per enrollee this data shows that it is less costly per enrollee to provide health care coverage for participants in traditional medicare than in ma plans subsidies rebates and quality rewards are included in ma plan costs if so why would there be too costly efforts underway to reduce healthcare costs why not attack costs within traditional medicare one program aimed at all medicare benefits there is no consensus among studies that medicare advantage plans are more cost effective than traditional medicare the october  cbo report sent to the house budget committee reported that the projected results for medicare premium support or privatization using the ma plan model would lower net federal payments to all medicare beneficiaries by  percent in  however total payments by all medicare affected beneficiaries would rise by  percent this is cost shifting not cost improvement watch for part  of  nrlns proposals to congress on medicare advantage bill kadereit president national retiree legislative network and we need your committed support to nrln action alerts wwwnrlnorgsehtml contribute to nrlns lobby effort wwwnrlnorgccdirecthtm make a taxdeductible donation to our american retirees education foundation aref research wwwseniorsareforgdonationshtml,1

mixedup confusion i was confused by the big coronavirus news conference sunday night confused by what was said and by what was not said or asked sunday morning the surgeon general said this coming week was going to be a pearl harbor moment for america sunday night at the news conference dr fauci the disease expert and pandemic pointman agreed that it was going to be a bad week for america a very bad week they were getting the numbers from two weeks ago now a  nd the number of deaths will be shocking to a lot of people he said if you are only getting the numbers from two weeks ago now doc did not pearl harbor hit two weeks ago dr fauci did not answer that question because nobody from the press asked it and why would the coming week take such a painful toll on the american peopleif all the damage was done two weeks ago dr fauci said the numbers will seem bad but the numbers will not reflect what the virus is doing currently so then next week will be a bad weekstatistically do i have that right doctor it is a pearl harbor for statistics dr fauci did not answer that either because again nobody from the press asked the question i guess the press did not want to seem too pushy and the media did not press fauci about how he thought america could reach his grim prediction of  deaths during this pandemic if we are still more than  deaths away from that fatal plateau  and the highest ranking officials in the country all said today that the number of deaths per day would be going down from here not up and that we would already hit the plateau ask no questions andget no answers this is the nation is watchdog the press sounds like the watchdog is napping either that or that dog will not hunt for some reason and this fauci is the nation is point man for the pandemic he seems confused and he is the chief statistician how can he be a statistician when he is bad at basic math and he is not much at predictions either does he read fortunes on the side too,1

as of this article there have been  confirmed cases of the coronavirus worldwide resulting in  deaths recently the world health organization declared the coronavirus a pandemic the fed has stepped in and lowered interest rates to  and as of friday and flooded the market with another t in easy money as a result businesses have begun to feel the effects supply chains have been disrupted consumers are distracted and equity markets are in steep declin  e since the start of the year the sampp  has plummeted more than  in the opening remarks of the march th world health organization who briefing we learned that in the past two weeks the number of cases of covid outside china has increased fold and the number of affected countries has tripled this message and the numbers behind it have incited fear in equity markets goldmans chief equity strategist david kostin has taken this recent upheaval as a clear indication that the sampp  bull market will soon end their research has led them to conclude that the sampp  will decline by   and  in the first second and third quarters of this year respectively the essential problem facing both medical professionals and investors is the same uncertainty there is still much that is unknown about the coronavirus as a result the future is difficult to predict this obscurity has left investors fleeing to assets that are more durable stores of value during turmoil for many gold is such a place in response to this strategy experts at the world gold council have referenced gold pricing data from the  sars epidemic as a corollary while there are many differences between the coronavirus and sars both share the characteristics of being a health crisis that looms large in the global psyche during the sars epidemic gold at one point reached an intraquarter maximum of  moreover as recently as late february the wall street journal reported that gold reached a fresh sevenyear high as investors flee riskier markets like any crisis the coronavirus has presented investors with reasons to be fearful while also offering opportunities gold may provide shortterm appreciation amid the turmoil however for many the benefits are downstream an investment in gold today represents a way to potentially limit volatility that is likely to persist for some time two days ago the cboe volatility index vix a popular measure of investor sentiment reached its highest point since the global financial crisis the vix rises when investors are fearful and fall when investors are confident the bottom line medical professionals are unclear on what lies ahead but they have seen enough to know it is not good and that the situation will likely worsen before improvements begin as the who directorgeneral remarked this is not just a public health crisis it is a crisis that will touch every sector  so every sector and every individual must be involved in the fight taking a cue from this uncertainty equity and bond markets have reacted with plummeting values and soaring volatility while frightening investors have an opportunity to reconsider their strategy and reevaluate their asset allocation in the context of what will prove to be the new normal in the coming months as the dow industrial average and the nasdaq have taken huge blows in the first quarter  its hard to see this nightmare ending any time soon gold has continued to stay steady even with the largest number of golf etfs ever to be liquidated has happened over the last few days  it seems the fed has fired every gun in its arsenal and nothing is working  you cant lower rates when theyre nearing negative interest rates and you cant print more money when you have a balance sheet that looks like ours its time to put your money where generations before you have always done and id imagine generations long after you will continue to preserve your wealth and that is goldive always been a big believer that when our economy starts to enter is a recession and its smarter to go with the lessons we have learned from the past get gold and get it while the prices are near the bottom of the barrel yet demand for the physical metal and not etfs is at an alltime high,1
"the virus of sovereignty of interpretation
the mass media is bitter struggle against the facts
the mass media are firing on all cylinders hardly any other topic before has been able to unmask the ideologically colored and extremely framed reporting in such an obvious way this is not surprising since the establishment is concerned with nothing less than averting a complete loss of trust in published opinion this is becoming increasingly difficult in view of the clear facts regarding the corona fake similar to an animal driven into a corner the representatives of the old parties and their willing helpers in print and television act with an unprecedented level of aggressiveness against everything and everyone who dares to question the obvious inconsistencies in view of the threatening fight for the sovereignty of interpretation the established media landscape obviously feels compelled to publish discrediting and abusive articles against all those who are critical of the government is corona measures at an unprecedented frequency the aggressive tonality in such hate speech which has appeared almost inflationary in the past few days is no coincidence under no circumstances should those who have previously held the comfortable position of being able to establish the published opinion as public opinion engage in an objective debate in view of the clear facts regarding the corona fraud this would be associated with a loss of trust on an unprecedented scale instead the decision was made to celebrate the credo of divide et impera ie rule by division in the familiar manner
from ard and zdf to the major daily newspapers and spiegel there is no balanced reporting whatsoever in the reporting on the recent increase in demonstrations against the government is corona measures of course the responsible editorsinchief are aware that accepting the arguments of the critics would be tantamount to capitulating the previously propagated lack of alternatives to the measures for the politicomedia cartel the only tried and tested remedy against the protests of the most diverse population groups which are loudly visible at those rallies seems to be a merciless discrediting of the participants the now absolutely inflationary use of the old battle terms and manslaughter arguments such as conspiracy theorists and aluminium hat wearers illustrate the beacon into which the corona fraud has forced the established media system
on the basis of this narrative of course established politics does not shy away from regurgitating such brute propagandistic approaches for example federal president steinmeier recently announced in this context that wearing a face mask is more advisable than wearing an aluminum hat  this unfunny disparagement of critics of government measures by a head of state is of course not an attempt at unsuccessful irony but the logical consequence of an interpretational sovereignty that cannot be regained on the basis of facts the exceptional situation brought about by the old ruling clique itself makes it absolutely necessary in view of the increasing protests from the broadest sections of society to split this resistance after all who likes to get involved with something that is supposedly only supported by crazy people extremists and other weirdos
the systematic denigration of the critics is therefore not a bizarre side effect but quite the opposite the actual core of the corona issue for the established structures it is a matter of averting a loss of trust on an unprecedented scale grotesquely this only works because of the clear facts by means of argumentum ad hominem ie with pseudoarguments that aim to attack the personal circumstances or characteristics of the critics in order to be able to avoid a substantive debate or to put it another way those who have taken the trouble to understand the facts of the corona fraud are already lost to the mainstream anyway so it is about convincing those who still believe in the story of a virus that is endangering the world is population that people with different views are crazy cranks and it is not worth dealing with their arguments interestingly until february  the government and the media were still playing down the coronavirus and calling warner nuts and scaremongers this approach is not new in the struggle for sovereignty of interpretation george orwell already outlined in his dystopian novel  a continuous change in assessments of the situation by those in power this was intended to give the population the impression that the state had always been an advocate of this view the stigmatization of views that are contrary to published opinion works in this way even with a  degree turn on the other hand people employed in relevant positions in the state apparatus who point out the abuses and express dissenting opinions are dismissed without further ado a consultant at the bmi who came to the conclusion in an page analysis that it was a global false alarm that went undetected for a long time was removed from his job and banned from the building 
a karl lauterbach who has groundbreaking tips such as converting vacuum cleaner bags into respiratory protection masks has been granted  appearances on major german talk shows since the beginning of march   on the other hand serious critics are still studiously refrained from being invited fortunately this is playing a less and less role because those who still think they are informed from multiple perspectives through political talk shows seem unwilling or unable to leave their ideological cocoon anyway the others on the other hand will succeed in penetrating propagandistic representations in other areas as well and thus increasingly evade the interpretive sovereignty of the established system if you want to gain something positive from the systematic attempt to curtail our freedom rights and destroy our economy you can be sure that those people who are now being discredited by the hundreds of thousands by the systemic press will take a closer look at the abuse of other groups in the future because once you have recognized that the emperor is sitting naked on his throne you can no longer be convinced that he actually died of corona

peace zones in the south caucasus a proposed discussion for the  nd may virtual conference on nonviolence governance while staying in armenia over this period of lockdown due to the corona virus we have been holding online talks linking the  nd anniversary of the armenian revolution  to nonviolence governance as one of the key issues of the jai jagat campaign the online discussions have presented some of the ways the armenian velvet revolution has created a new armenia since  under nicol pashiyans leadership with the civil contract my step party some of the changes have included freedom of the press from censorship greater attention to human rights and education the fight against corruption the strengthening of civil society and so forth the armenian revolution has been an indigenous revolution like the freedom struggle was in india it was the people of armenia that have been able to rally together to call for a more broadbased and inclusive society this call came from within the country and is exemplary in showing the tenacity particularly of the youth in armenian society since this was an indigenous revolution there is scope for looking at how values of nonviolence are being carried into governance as india partially succeeded in bringing nonviolence into policies and programs after independence people are looking to armenia to advance this experiment further we have discovered from talking to some of the participants of the revolution that if these foundations can be sustained to endure the future this would signal a great advancement of nonviolence in governance one of the ticklish issues that continues to constrain nonviolence and the pursuit of peace in armenia is the militarization that has had to persist due to the ongoing conflict with azerbaijan over nagorno karabakh the lack of headway of peace negotiation with the osce minsk group followed by the four day war in  have made the conflict even more intractable after the nonviolent revolution there has been sincere efforts at reviving the peace dialogue and both governments have tried to prepare their populations for peace the lack of movement on substantive issues over the past year has led people to become more cynical of peace negotiations continuing in a separate effort georgian civil society since  and later through the gandhi foundation of georgia and in armenia have been pressing for a peace zone in the south caucasus the idea of a peace zone has emerged from a variety of country contexts local peace zones in the areas of conflict in colombia and philippines are examples where local communities have been committed to neutrality during a conflict between the state and insurgency groups other examples are in the autonomous regions of nicaragua where ethnic caribbean populations have created an autonomous region within the nicaraguan state to maintain peace similarly in changmai area of thailand there are autonomous regions for indigenous people the first nation people living on indian reserves in canada have been given sovereign rights within the federal structures in india the northeastern states were made up of autonomous communities with guarantees under the  th schedule of the constitution these are all examples of giving rights to secure zones which are meant to maintain peace in seeing whether any of these examples could help institute peace zones in the south caucasus it is proposed that experts from these various countries be asked to join the virutal march to talk about their experiences it would be then possible for those promoting peace in the caucasus region to give response the following international persons are being suggested to participate in a discussion on peace zones an equal number would be expected from the region  colombian peace zones zohanny arboleda muti from cinep in bogata  philippines peace zones irene santiago in mindano  nicaragua peace zones in autonomous regions peter utting and amalia in managua  mexicous border peace zone sonia deotto in mexico city  canadian first nation people james loney in toronto  australiannew zealand indigenous communities ben chapple in melbourne  northeast in india to be reconfirmed  peace in nepal subhash in kathmandu  thailands changmai autonomous region weena n from bangkok  richard rubenstein george mason university virginia usa in determining the agenda of the conference we are suggesting that it be based on the various case studies and through discussion eliciting response especially from the armenian colleagues,1

today i am calling for immediate action by gwinnett county sheriff butch conway and other local leaders to protect the public jail inmates staff and their families from the increasing threat of coronavirus covid while other counties around the country and the state including dekalb have taken significant steps in the right direction gwinnett has been slower to act only suspending inperson visits to the jail on monday while this is a positive step larger action  s must be taken this is even more imperative with the first confirmed case of a georgia department of corrections employee having tested positive for covid based on my  years of law enforcement experience and conversations that i have had with those in the public health medical criminal justice and law enforcement community i am calling on gwinnett county to immediately take the following actions suspend the inmate work detail program for the duration of this crisis make the video call system free for inmates so that visitation can continue virtually while suspended in person stop accepting inmates being booked for nonviolent misdemeanor offenses and instead ticket and release them accepting only inmates into the jail charged with violent felony offenses that represent a threat to public safety institute comprehensive health care checks and support for inmates and staff in the jail in order to identify possible cases of covid early and stop the spread begin a managed release of nonviolent offenders currently serving in the jail to reduce the jail population and limit the possible spread of covid in a confined environment where sanitation and health is already a challenge these actions strike an appropriate balance between public health and public safety and it is necessary that gwinnett be proactive and act now before covid has reached the jail those with expertise have made it clear that jails and prisons are one of the most likely sources of an outbreak that will impact inmate and staff health and in all likelihood spread to the larger community this will endanger more residents including our seniors and those in highrisk groups,1

children can lose healthcare coverage if congress doesnt act funding for the child health insurance program chip is running out and if congress does not reauthorize it before the end of december many children across the country and right here in north carolina will be left without health insurance coverage congress created chip in  as a block grant to assist the states in ensuring that children born into medicaid could remain covered medicaid or chip until they re  ached the age of  before chip if a baby was born into a family eligible for medicaid the child could lose coverage between the ages of  and  if the family did not meet certain parameters the chip program was a relief to these parameters and got support from democrats and republicans since most people agreed that eligible children should be covered by medicaid but right now the future of the chip program is uncertain since the program ran out of funds this past september  and congress has not agreed on a plan to renew the roughly  billion a year it spends on the program members of both parties in the us house and the us senate agree that congress should provide money for chip for five years through  but they disagree over how to pay for it in an opinion article written by dr david t tayloe jr who is a pediatrician in goldsboro and was one of the leaders in north carolina in developing the chip program in our state he recalled the bipartisan effort in the nc general assembly that led to the establishment of the chip program in our state he says we currently have a seamless system of care for lowincome children who qualify for medicaid or chip parents children and providers are happy with the way our system works to improve access and quality if congress does not renew its funding for chip many children from lowincome families will be left without care and subsequently are more likely to fall between the cracks and will not be treated since their parents cannot afford to pay for private healthcare or for health insurance children are our most vulnerable population and we should do everything in our power to provide for their medical needs httpwwwnewsobservercomopiopedarticlehtml,1

i was flying from dubai to melbourne and i got on the plane and one of the air crew came up and said would you like to take a shower mr proctor i thought she was putting me on i said theres a shower on the plane she said yes but were booking times to use it now so if you want to take one on this flight you have to put in your name i jumped at the chance when my turn came i got in there and it was a big big room on that plane with beautiful heated tile floors it was amazing i just wanted to be able to say id had a shower at  feet now ive done this multiple times but you know if somebody had suggested youre going to fly from dubai to melbourne and you can have a shower a hot meal watch a movie or lay down and go to sleep that would have sounded absolutely outrageous not too long ago how did the wright brothers ever even imagine they could make human beings fly people must have thought they were crazy to try to make something like that happen but they did it now we all take it for granted whats worse is we usually reserve that kind of incredible invention and innovation for other people but let me tell you something theres absolutely no difference between the wright brothers and you and me or anybody else the only difference is the wright brothers allowed themselves to dream they tuned into that special frequency where human beings can literally bring something thats never existed before into reality all throughout history there have been men and women from ordinary backgrounds who set out with nothing but a dream in their minds and were able to accomplish something extraordinary it would seem these people were special or fortunate or blessed in some way that most people are not but thats not the case because what makes the difference when it comes to achieving the impossible is not fortune or favor its decisions and commitments i talk to a lot of people who just dont believe they have that something special the great people of the world must have had to do the great things they did that makes me very upset because i know its not true the ability to do something great to achieve independence and freedom to shape the futurethats within every single one of us but most people theyve lost the ability to dream and thats where it all begins so i want to invite you today to dream again dream up a future where your finances are no longer a source of stress dream up a future where youre no longer fighting to make ends meet dream up a future where you can hop on a plane from dubai to melbourne and take a shower on the way while youre  feet up ive done it you can too all of that is well within your reach and more all you have to do is make a decision to do what it takes to experience those things and make a commitment that youre not going to give up hope until you do if you dream of owning your own business working from home and having financial freedom theres one small decision im going to ask you to make today right now my good friend adrian morrison is an absolute expert at helping people from all over the world achieve extraordinary income results with ecommerce hes putting on a free workshop this week where hes going to show everyone who attends how to setup their own online store how to advertise for it and even what products to sell in it maybe youve heard of people having success in ecommerce today and thought well those people must be lucky but thats not me stop thats no way to think thats no way to dream can you imagine what might be possible for you you dont have to start without a map for where youre going because adrian created this training specifically to give that to you hes even going to show you the exact products hes sold in his own ecommerce stores that have helped him make millions hes no different no more special than you and me hes just allowed himself to dream and hes committed to making his dream a reality are you ready to dream again click the link below to sign up for adrians free training httpinviteesaworkshopcombob youll be glad you did thank you,1

"if you missed the letter to the editor in the whig im proud to be endorsed by joe carabettaformer
republican central committee member and former county councilman dan schneckenburger
the case for change
from dan schneckenburger fair hill taxpayer joe carabetta perryville taxpayer may  
four years ago both of us challenged alan mccarthy in the  republican primary although he was victorious and became county executive both of us have a unique perspective on the record of the incumbent
although alan campaigned as a conservative and would fight taxes he significantly raised both the property and income tax his first year he has also increased local government spending every year and refuses to hold the tax revenue stream to constant yield this year which will raise the tax burden on all residents this man misled the public during this  campaign and if he was honest he would not have been elected and we both still have his campaign mailers stating he would fight tax increases
both joe and i have disagreed on many different policy issues over the years we certainly agree that our tax burden is too high and we should make it the top priority to reduce taxes it is impossible to ignore the  million surpluses in  and  as an indication that our tax rate is too high even in this fiscal year the county has an additional surplus although we both are residents of other states we still own and pay property taxes in cecil county
that is why we both support and endorse danielle hornberger for county executive in the  primary on june  she is a woman of high integrity who has made it a top priority to put the cecil county taxpayer first with the economic reduction that has occurred as a result of covid  we need a leader who will limit government spending support all of our first responders and bring true conservative values for the future vision of the county this is why we urge all our past supporters to support ms hornberger in the june  primary mail in only we cannot afford another four years of a mccarthy regime",1

"today i was disturbed to read that justin trudeau is political office has ordered canada is nonpartisan public service to do his political damage control
according to media reports officials from global affairs canada were ordered by the prime minister is office to pressure former career diplomat david mulroney who is now an academic and fellow at the university of toronto munk school to clear his public statements with the trudeau government the reason for this pressure was reportedly due to the election environment and therefore mr mulroney had to be very very careful
this exchange is highly inappropriate and represents a blatant attempt by justin trudeau to muzzle a respected former career diplomat trudeau has shown a clear pattern of silencing those who speak out
justin trudeau once said he admires china is basic dictatorship but this is not how things are done in canada
this also raises questions as to whether or not officials have been ordered by trudeau is pmo to speak with former ambassador to china and former trudeau cabinet minister john mccallum mr mccallum has made a number of inappropriate statements over the past year including his comments on canada is extradition process and his encouragement of chinese foreign interference in the upcoming election
as mr mulroney stated discouraging private citizens with expertise in foreign relations from speaking freely is fundamentally an undemocratic idea i could not agree more justin trudeau must answer for the many times he has exploited canada is nonpartisan public service for his own political purpose
justin trudeau promised to do politics differently but clearly he is not as advertised",1

"with the governor planning to reopen the schools september th and with the crisis situations in our country we need do everything possible to provide a safe and secure environment for students teachers staff and families in jefferson county there are four steps that should be considered to increase safety and security in our schools the goal is to decrease a situation where the likelihood of a shooting and the number of children who will be harmed the steps are really four interconnected pillars preemptive response access control hardening classrooms and onsite incident response
 responding preemptively
in order to preemptively stop school violence it is vital to establish an environment that provides solid psychological security a promising track is to develop relevant and uptodate forms and modes of psychological first aid
psychological first aid should be a national strategy used as a preventative measure for dealing with more serious psychological trauma currently the development of psychological first aid can be highly effective in smaller sample populations such as schools a workplace or a religious or social association and can be put into practice in everyday life
as it pertains to schools and schoolage kids the initial action is to involve the students using them as an informational resource can make all subsequent actions more effective survey their experiences and then use the information openly but anonymously so they can see the followthrough
additionally put students in as many leadership positions in the process as possible this grows them and will provide a wealth of insights that the adults might have missed
all of this will build trust and inclusion that will empower the other preemptive actions the students will be your best source of information this generation of young people lives in nearconstant communication but it is not always transparent to the staff and faculty given that there were warning signs before almost all of the recent school shootings many of which were stopped making the students a part of this process is a key
that said these warning signs must provoke immediate action the majority of the shooters have had some mental health or social interaction issues and people noticed the parkland shooter was flagged multiple times yet no one took action
this was egregious but not that abnormal police and school officials have to respond to red flags on social media or in overheard conversations this response must be immediate and highly public that way we can stop what we know about and deter what we do not
teachers must follow due process but fear of overstepping one is bounds must not be allowed to obstruct intervention worries about giving a student a black mark must be swept aside troubled individualsand all those around themare much better served by stopping them from doing something potentially drastic and deadly action must be taken before shots are fired if at all possible
 control access to the school
the second pillar is firmly controlling access to school facilities if a person does not belong in the school or is attempting to bring in prohibited items such as weapons they must be denied access schools must have limited points of entry one or at most two each of which should be monitored and controlled by personnel that can turn people away when needed
school personnel and students must not be able to cheat by opening doors for friends or for parents worse yet is opening doors for a stranger just to be nice convenience must not be a factor if a shooter is blocked from entering a school they are unlikely to do much harm or at least a lot less
controlling access to a school is particularly critical at the beginning and end of the day but also applies during the remainder of the day the question how did the shooter get in is always a pivotal one
how people enter the building and who monitors the access process are a key set of decisions they must be tailored to each specific school too much security or too heavyhanded a footprint can add psychological insecurity to the student body which can do harm even if a shooting never takes place
a balance must be found and maintained this decision
cannot be driven from outside the school it must be seen as part of the school is central culture if students see it that waywhich will require research education as to the reasoning and a deft touch with both students and parentsthey will be far more likely to buy into the practice
 hardening the classroom
next we must do a better job of securing or hardening classrooms as potential targets inside the school classrooms are often chosen to shelterinplace particularly for the youngest kids who are very difficult to move quickly
all classroom doors have windows to allow observation and protection for the children but in an active shooter situation this becomes a liability there needs to be a lowcost fast way of blocking the outside view through the window likewise the doors must be lockable from the inside by the door is lock and with some sort of very simple quickly applied additional blocking mechanism
within the classroom teachers must be able to provide their students both cover protection from gunfire and concealment a place to hide the courageous teacher who hid her young pupils in storage cabinets and then faced the gunman in sandyhook gave her life but her quick thinking saved the children
there are now bulletproof sanctuaries that can be put inside classrooms and can double as story corners while these may be beyond the budgets of most schools it is a good model to provoke the imagination we must devise the best cover and concealment we can find
as a last resort teachers and older kids should also make a determination as to how they might actually fight an attacker with improvised weapons available in the class
the best mode of attack must be specified for each individual classroom grade level and teacher teachers should first be briefed or taught by an expert what is expected of them then the teachers should devise a specific plan of action for their own classroom this should be reviewed and if need be adjusted so that it provides the maximum protection and the minimum of psychological insecurity
once the plan is approved and set it should be published in writing so it is not just in the teacher is head any substitute teacher should be required to review these plans
lastly drills should be conducted first with the teacher alone then with adults roleplaying as the kids and finally with the actual students older kids high schooler is can be told what the drills are really for though teachers should characterize them for younger students as something like stranger drills to avoid any unneeded worry
 onsite incident response
that leads to pillar no  schools must have an onsite response capability that can confront and stop an active shooter
law enforcement will do their best to respond in a timely manner but they will quite often fail most active shooter scenarios are done within  minutes few if any police or sheriff departments can promise to respond quickly especially in nonurban areas how schools achieve this capability is again a delicate decision
every school district or individual school should come to this decision themselves a highly centralized solution is not recommended the how of achieving an adequate onsite response must once again factor in the school culture this is clearly the most contentious aspect of school security
there are four main options  a school can have dedicated police assets on campus which we do in washington and jefferson high schools along with deputies engaged in other schools via direct patrols  they can hire private security personnel  or they can seek volunteer security personnel from the community such as veterans or retired law enforcement
there are numerous options for schools to attain this onsite capability and communities must choose what they can support both budgetwise and within their collective moral structures remember too much security can be almost as big a problem as too little so the right solution for each school is critical
this is about more than just handing out pistols or asking those with concealed carry permits to bring their weapons to work this will involve protocols for the storage of weapons vetting psych evaluations for those who volunteer and extensive training regimens the training must include negotiation and deescalation skills nonlethal control techniques team response drills firearms training and extensive traumalevel first aid
this all bears emphasis you must have the correct people as well as the correct training the firearms training in particular must entail far more than shooting a few dozen rounds at a local range shooting in close proximity to nonhostile personnel is the most difficult gun skill to learnit must be trained and drilled until it is ingrained and only attempted in the correct situations this is particularly essential if we are going to depend on a volunteer or staffbased response capability
the fact that certain individuals will actively deter and respond to threats need not lead to culture of fear among the student body local schools and communities will be able to develop their own psychosocial infrastructure that is compatible with each individual is preferred form of security
some students are more attracted to a physical procedure and therefore will be more likely to respond appropriately based on their training likewise those who are attracted to a psychological facilitation can respond positively and rebound more quickly from the trauma of an attack event
both deterring and facilitating through adequately trained response are necessary to maintain psychological strength and resilience this is needed both in the event and immediately afterward
one final note of action no matter how one of these situations plays out the school and community will be severely traumatized if a solid base of psychological security has been laid beforehand along with the physical security measures the school and student body have the best chance of weathering the tragedy with the least damage
strong followup support must begin as soon as the site is secured and it must continue until every need is met if the young people know the counseling department well from preexisting relationships this can go relatively quickly bringing in strangers may be needed but it not optimal school districts are better served if the counseling department is well and professionally staffed long before any event occurs
these four steps and the followup will not guarantee  percent safety in our schools but they will materially increase that security through deterrence strong defense measures and adeptness in ending the situation as quickly as possible and returning to normality as swiftly as possible
these are not pieinthesky ideas they are already being applied in schools across america it is time to apply them in all our schools",1

editorial  bob anthony is the longest serving member on the oklahoma corporation commission occ he was first elected to the threeperson board in november of  and has served five consecutive sixyear terms thirty years is a long time its probably fair to say that most oklahomans arent fully aware of the duties and responsibilities of the occ in a nutshell  and directly from the commissions website  the occ is a regulatory agency for the state of oklahoma with  emphasis on the fuel oil and gas public utilities and transportation industries its also probably fair to say that on the surface anthonys tenure has been mostly satisfactory we just think its time to take a look below the surface and encourage voters to consider the idea that it is time for a change in this office anthonys tenure hasnt been without controversy in  before the  metoo movement brought the issue of sexual harassment front and center the fidelis group llc of oklahoma city was hired to conduct an investigation into complaints directed at anthonys aide joe briley a previously confidential report prepared for the occ contains interviews with anthony and  other commission employees of the   were male and  were female to be clear anthony was not accused of sexual harassment himself interviews with employees felt he was protecting a harassing aide at the expense of a productive work environment at the commission the fidelis group report noted the costs and inefficiencies associated with the incident under anthonys watch  including the cost of the outside investigation fidelis group comments include  methods of dealing with problems related to mr briley have produced numerous inefficiencies but perhaps more significantly they are indicative of a lack of trust for mr briley that hinders the effective and efficient functioning of the organization  it appears that employees feel they must always deal with him in a very cautious manner if a better working relationship existed between mr briley and other occ employees the productivity of all concerned would be improved a large number of staff hours have been devoted to dealing with problems generated by the behavior of mr briley over the period of time he has been employed by the occ it was estimated that the deputy director of the pud has personally spent well in excess of  hours in dealing with problems related to mr briley the occ director of administration estimated that at least  staff days per month have been devoted to dealing with problems related to mr briley during the entire time he briley has been employed by the occ the cost of the current fidelis group engagement is directly attributable to ongoing problems concerning the behavior of mr briley in his interactions with other occ employees yes anthony could have put a stop to the uncomfortable work environment and the lost productivity and expense of an investigation can be considered waste briley was hired for his first job with the occ in march  he continued with the commission until march of   just prior to anthony filing for reelection the fidelis group report shows that briley worked in two other departments and had issues with management before becoming anthonys aide there was a possibility that briley would lose his job and anthonys aide at the time agreed to trade positions with him anthony was documented in the report saying that he relied on briley to secure accurate information for him anthony told investigators that he knew nothing about the allegations of sexual harassment physical intimidation or authority intimidation relative to briley except for what was contained in a letter sent to him by occs general counsel anthony also suggested that if briley is harsh or abrasive in dealing with employees briley might profit from counseling and perhaps some form of sensitivity awareness program maybe this just scratches the surface of waste of productivity and resources by an aide that anthony relied on for information maybe not take your opinion and your vote to the polls on tuesday june,1

what are the chances that the original front double doors to the blacksmith shop built when the a minchau blacksmith shop was erected in  would survive what are the chances that the doors would have been preserved in such good condition over the years see our post and picture from the edmonton journal dated june th already in the  is the a minchau blacksmith shop was recognized by the province of alberta for the important historical and economical value it  possessed and the royal alberta museum approached fred and stanley minchau asking if the museum could have the doors and in exchange the museum would supply them with a new set of doors this was in  and the doors were then on display for many years to come in the pioneer section of the museum with other notable pieces from that era that important historical value of the blacksmith shop has only increased and greatly as time has gone by and it has been a full  years since the doors were originally donated to the museum at the province is request half a century ago how fortunate we are as a city and as a province to have in our possession not only the original doors from the  blacksmith shop but also the original blacksmith shop itself typically it would be a reversed situation historical building is demolished we find an original piece or part of its structure that belongs to it people are captivated by its discovery but then are left to imagination to fill in the gaps of history we do not need to rely on our imagination in the case of the a minchau blacksmith shop built in  it still stands in its original form and in its original place of construction in the heart of old strathcona a vitally important cornerstone of our history and heritage and our economic and social growth is still intact and today needs our help in protecting it from demolition we believe that the alberta provincial government already understood the significant value of the a minchau blacksmith shop in  when they approached the blacksmith shop owners fred and stanley asking for the doors to be preserved in the provincial museum at the time the shop was in full operation and not needing a historical designation itself today it does we believe that the municipal government already understood the significant value of the a minchau blacksmith shop in  and further so in  as per official city of edmonton records the city of edmonton planning and development department selected a project team in  to identify significant buildings bridges landscapes cemeteries trees architectural fragments street furnishings and monuments the result was the register of historic resources in edmonton  which at the time was a list of  resources that merited conservation in  the register of historic resources in edmonton was presented to city council the a minchau blacksmith shop is on that inventory of historic resources unfortunately being on the register of historic resources in edmonton an inventory of historic resources that merit conservation does not save a historic heritage building from demolition this we now know to be a direct result of weak legislation on the part of the municipal government while these laws may be weak in protecting historical heritage sites to be sure they are strong and strident in favoring developers who seem to want more and concede less currently and as of may th edmonton city council has voted to have mayor don iveson officially approach the provincial government to assist in granting the a minchau blacksmith shop an official provincial heritage designation which would protect it from demolition see our post dated june nd kudos to the mayor and city council for taking this great step forward kudos to everyone who has written their elected government officials your voices are being heard and have helped support the municipal government is challenging decision municipal legislation needs to change now but today we need the province to step up we have the original blacksmith door we have the original blacksmith shop we do not as yet have the official designation to save this historical heritage building we are in a race to save our historical heritage buildings from being demolished please email and write the provincial government today the province has the legal power to designate an official heritage status which will protect the a minchau blacksmith shop from demolition and provide a place of living history for all to enjoy please send emails to culturetourismministergovabca ricardo miranda  minister of culture and tourism premiergovabca premier rachel notley in subject header for both write designate the minchau blacksmith shop official heritage status please let the provincial government know that you support an official registered designation for the a minchau blacksmith shop and that the minchau blacksmith shop represents a large part of our history and heritage and should be preserved please ask the provincial government to designate the a minchau blacksmith shop an official historical heritage site use as many or as few words as you would like to express your support for an official historical designation again a huge thank you to everyone who is following this page who are writing letters and to individuals who believe in saving our history and heritage if you have already sent an email to the provincial government we urge you

"mircea hava pnl mep  billion euros for the romanian economy
the european commission through its president ursula von der leyen today presented the proposed budget for the economic recovery of europe after the coronavirus pandemic  billion euros a realistic figure a clear and expected interpretation of the fact that the european union is a system that works and protects when needed which can turn the effects of this crisis into opportunities but for me more important than how this money is shared and spent is the promise on behalf of this recovery program next generation eu in short the present is not excluded but it must be seen as a link with the next generations who are guaranteed that their future is taken seriously
this proposed recovery fund together with the money from the multiannual financial framework means almost  trillion euros which must not only keep us from going back to the middle ages but also make us talk about the future with solutions and not in parables the funds will be distributed over three pillars grants and loans to member states depending on the needs of each based on the mechanisms of eu programs
romania will be able to spend up to  billion euros that outside the multiannual financial framework i say romania can because it is a proven fact in our country the intention does not necessarily equate to success it is a burden we still carry making us fight with ourselves and it causes many of us not to take ourselves too seriously

with the money from the next generation eu the ground can really be opened for innovation research and education if you bring money in these fields you will become competitive in terms of your own human resources with good students who will stay in the country as future professionals i dont rule out technology here we have a paradox on the one hand we export on the other hand we have a huge gap with the west in terms of digital infrastructure that integrates the services of ministries and local government in our country the files are still in the envelope and it is not known who they reach through the ministries the man is waiting in line for almost anything with a chance to return the next day we can rely on a national cloud to be involved in stimulating digital industries and the benefits they generate romania needs to move to the widespread implementation of g technology to finance broadband infrastructure to digitally manage all public services to give money to companies to finance products and services derived from smart specializations equally important is the financing of artificial intelligence in industry or critical hospital infrastructure there is also room for alternative fuels such as hydrogen of course i am hard to censor regarding this potential that romania has but that does not mean that i do not see other opportunities this money can be used for absolutely essential mobility corridors from highways to bypasses of urban agglomerations the local real estate patrimony can be successfully reconverted into spaces filled with creative economic activities or small production workshops let me give you one example from alba iulia the abandoned military buildings in the citadel which can be transformed based on a variety of ways of occupation the agglomerations of economic potential are vital see the port of constanta but also the corridors of economic development bucharestbrasov sibiuclujnapoca timisoaraaradoradea or galatibraila however i come back to who are the ones who will make us operate at full capacity in terms of the pace and the way in which this money will reach romania that should be our immediate concern",1

tariffs do they help businesses with global competition or are they killing american business they are killing american business tariffs sound like they should be a tax on other countries products so american buyers are less likely to import foreign products american companies can compete because american products are less expensive compared to the products produced by other countries and our companies win that is not exactly how they work when the united states  imposes a tariff on a foreign product americans pay the tariff and so the foreign products are more expensive for us and the us government pockets the tariff we pay for them if we buy less of those products because they are more expensive then the theory is our domestic companies will begin producing and selling those products and americans win and other countries lose thats not what happens we are a global economy and we depend on selling our products internationally and other countries depend on buying our product and natural recourses we are now in a fullblown trade war we do not live in a vacuum so our tariffs paid for by americans are met with tariffs imposed by other countries on our goods so we sell less of them in  american farmers sold  tons of soybeans to china this year our farmers sold about  tons of soybeans to china a fraction of the previous sales china is a huge country and is run by a central government that has sought other sources of products so when the trade war is over our sales to them wont come back the trade war is hurting american companies and we will probably not recover when we stop this nonsense jeff edberg ccim sior here is a well written article from the sior report from fall  titled economic war on tariffs commercial real estate brokers shouldnt ignore the tariff situation if the industrial market hadnt been so strong these past couple years transaction business and corporate expansion would have already slowed for every tariff the united states imposes on imports from a foreign country a retaliatory tariff is placed on american products sold abroad if this sounds like economic war it essentially is and in every type of conflict there is always collateral damage lets look at one unexpected area where tariff wars are hurting real estate brokers the businessmans lunch when the united states imposed a tariff on steel and aluminum imports from the european union the retaliation was a  tariff on harley motorcycles us whiskies and other goods brown formanthe maker of jack daniels and other liquorsreported the tariff situation is costing the company  million according to the wall street journal if the threatened tariff on mexico had not been retracted in june  it would have been hard for restaurants to cheaply source avocados and other vegetables and fruits grown south of the border avocado toast could have disappeared from menus if this all appears silly its not there is a caution here for brokers of commercial real estate robert hand sior a broker with louisiana commercial realty in metairie la produced a report explaining that tariffs steal money out of consumers pockets by causing prices to increase stifle creativity reward inefficiencies and destroy the competitive drive that allows a free market economy to deliver cheaper smarter and innovative products why brokers should pay attention totrade wars tariffs increase the costs of what your tenants sell so higher prices cause consumer demand to decline a manufacturer faces declining sales so to cut costs it will first take the easy route seeking rent reductions or curtailing expansion again according to the wall street journal the tariffsparticularly on steelhave cost general motors and ford billions of dollars each its not just the manufacturer the retail sector will be affected as well what we are talking about says hand are companies such as amazon walmart and home depot that utilize huge warehouses to store inventory and when consumers demand a product inventory is taken out for shipment tariffcaused priceincreases will be passed on to consumers who are going to buy less at retailers such as walmartand that means stocking less inventory and possibly a reduction in warehouse space the good news is that it takes about a year for the effects from tariffs to enter the system and another year for individual companies to start rightsizing warehouses says hand on the other side of the coin the bad news is the industrial sector will be the first to get hit as the need for warehouse space will decrease hand isnt the only one researching the tariff situation to get ahead of the curve geoff poston sior vice president of the cushman amp wakefield  thalhimer virginia beach industrial group checked in with the port of virginia in hampton roads an important contributor to the local economy the ports response is that it is closely monitoring the current trade environment and the effects any additional tariffs might have on its business says poston its forecasting shows that an estimated  of cargo moving across the port would be impacted by the latest round of us tariffs as of may  china is the ports largest trading partner and collectively chinese exports and imports subject to tariffsrepresent  of its total teu twentyfoot equivalent unit volume short and longterm the port is taking the tariff situation into serious consideration poston continues it is diversifying its cargo mix which is something the port has been planning for some time but now hedging its bets in a challenging trade environment poston also queried a pl thirdparty logistics provider handling shipping and receiving for manufacturers and other clientsincluding one that imports pigments for dying from south korea for this particular client tariffs caused the importation of pigments from south korea to no longer be economically feasible and the client turned to a domestic company the concern for some companies is that domestic providers are working from inventory and a change in pricing would come when new inventory is needed the trade environment is on everyones radar says poston its affecting certain industriessuch as agricultureimmediately other industries have experienced no effect so far but there will be in the near future another broker talking about the tariff situation with associates is jim steinbauer sior vice presidentrealtor with steinbauer associates inc in lakeland fla i have a good client in the stainlesssteel business in lakeland and we were discussing the tariff situation back at the beginning of the year says steinbauer my client testified in front of congress last fall he said the tariff on raw materials and different costs of production has raised his costs which he has been able to pass on so far his customers have accepted the higher costs also accepting the higher costs and passing them on are developers steinbauer adds he recently sold a acre parcel to a manufacturer who was going to build  square feet it will be a steel building and despite the higher costs the project is going forward steinbauer assumed the costs of the steel was locked in as early as last year although the recent scare about mexican tariffs caused a bit of worry during that kerfuffle the us lifted the steel and aluminum tariffs imposed on canada which will in turn withdraw the retaliatory tariffs it levied on billions of dollars of american imports construction prices are going through the roof says poston while labor is a challenge most contractors cite tariffs as an issue he shares steel prices are up although everyone has been able to pass the higher costs through to the consumer a domestic manufacturer i spoke to buys most of its metals in the us but prices have increased so steeply it has negatively affected margins he has been forced to increase pricing twice in one year according to the washington post in  us companies went on a hiring spree adding the most new employees in more than two decades as a good economy caused demand to rise unfortunately so far this year manufacturers added so few jobs the sector has seen the weakest gains since before the current presidential administration hiring in the manufacturing sector could become a concern if it starts to affect physical expansion by us companies as every commercial real estate broker knows the rising cost of steel and other tariffs has meant construction costs have vaulted and continue to do so but the need for new industrial space has meant those costs have just been absorbed how long that will go on is the big question the boom in the industrial sector hasnt diminished yet says steinbauer developers are spending money to build new warehouses but what happens next depends on whether they can get the increase in rents to match the higher costs to build poston adds so far he is seen no adverse impact to new construction in the industrial sector but it is something we are closely watching as every commercial real estate broker knows the rising cost of steel and other tariffs has meant construction costs have vaulted and continue to do so but the need for new industrial space has meant those costs have just been absorbed how long that will go on is the big question by steve bersman sponsored by the sior foundation contributing sior authors robert hand sior geoff poston sior jim steinbauer

top things from today is roundtable
 deeper ingrained into the life of the community the influence of the pastor in the community can be significant first name basis with the community stake holders first name basis with the mayor fire chief coaches principles and school superintendents
 greater agility small churches can pivot on ideas and programs faster they are nimble and respond quicker not only to problems but opportunities
 faster decision making the larger the organization the slower the decision making process we may come to the same the very same decision but it has more layers
 faster communication
 closer community precovid  i went with one of my mega church pastor friends at a major sporting event as we were walking out a random guy yelled at him hey there is my pastor my friend turned to me and had no clue who the guy was so i would say that i have a relationship with everyone where he was not able to have a relationship with everyone i not only know their name but their stories as well
 simpler problem solving
 extreme personal touch show up in the moments and memories in their lives birthday parties weddings sports games
 pastor their community larger church pastor their church for the rural or small church the town becomes his parish god called you to pastor the town through the church
 small church can do ministry accompanied by their family you know you are a small church pastor because you are married to the worship leader wm is director and children is director kids play the drums clean the church mow the yard it is a family ministry
 the ability to personally influence people for ministry most of the pastoral influence is platform based influence is stronger in smaller settings young people personally know the pastor and often have opportunities to explore a sense of call to ministry
 enjoy a broader variety of ministry as a traditional shepherd while megachurch is often focused on being a visionary rural pastors get to spread their time out with preachingteachingcarecounselingadministration it is more people focused than system focused rural pastors have the opportunity to be generalists it is frustrating at times in terms of growth but it is also a blessing and keeps us sharp in discernment
 intimacy you have the ability to connect with your entire church know their stories and for them to feel connected personally to you you have the ability to speak weekly to each family personally and get very connected to their lives
 impact we only truly impact someone is life up close a small church pastor has the ability to dynamically impact the lives of each person in their flock that is especially powerful when it comes to the kids and youth you can connect with them and impact them powerfully
 importance of authenticity because of closeness it is crucial that you be authentic in all you dothere is no separation of life inside and outside the church your life will be inspected in every aspectmarriage parenting personal discipline etc you will have the chance to live by example people will model their marriage parenting and personal discipline from what they see in you
 sad to say but few will remember your sermons but they will remember those moments you touched them personally and you get to do that every week this is true for us bigger church pastors as wellfew remember the sermons everyone remembers the touch in their time of pain or confusion
 be the best you can bedo not use the statement we are too small for thatwhatever you do make it the best possible you cannot do everything but what you can do make it good
 focus on what you can do well and do not try to be a buffet of everything someone else is doing do not be afraid to say we do not do that if you spread the paint too thin nothing looks good

my opponent argues that we need guns to keep us safe but research shows that people with access to firearms in their home are almost twice as likely to be murdered when the centers for disease control and prevention did research on preventing gun violence us congress threatened to pull its funding a reckless move which would have made us less safe from the next ebola break out zika hivaids etc if you really think guns are safe you should not be afraid of high quality research and you should not need to bully scientists,1

"a chocolate medal isnt that enough
on the front line facing covid for several months hospital staff are in the spotlight since the government announced this week that a national tribute would be paid to them this summer on the occasion of the national holiday and that a commitment medal will be awarded to them
unsurprisingly the hospital staff rose up indicating that they wanted neither tribute nor medal but real changes and more resources for the hospital system
in addition caregivers from many departments were surprised today to learn that the exceptional bonus promised by the executive would not be granted to them because they were not part of one of the most affected departments while the the effort seems to have been shared across all the departments of the territory without exception and even outside the covid services
on the move today at the pitiesalpetriere hospital emmanuel macron recognized an error in the strategy announced two years ago at the time of his reform of the health system
the head of state also asked his minister of health olivier veran to start a consultation next week with the aim of raising the salaries and careers of caregivers a future health plan which will be based on four pillars the upgrading of salaries and careers the establishment of a more flexible system investment in equipment and buildings and a new organization of the health system based on the territory
we often hear it our health system seems out of breath but what is it really
if we compare the health expenditure of european countries in relation to their gdp france is the country which in proportion to its means spends the most on its health in europe rd country in the oecd with  of gdp devoted to health ie  billion euros spent we see that germany and sweden are slightly below chart 
despite this significant expenditure france ranks only th among european countries graph  offering the best care according to the serious euro health consumer index survey which is based on  criteria such as waiting time effectiveness the range of services offered prevention access to new drugs etc
a study using oecd figures also shows that france has only  doctors and  nurses per  inhabitants far behind germany norway and even countries like switzerland graph 
although less numerous in france medical staff are not better paid if in most countries the salary of nurses is higher than the average salary of the country this is not the case in france indeed the salary of nurses is  lower than the average salary in france while it is  higher in belgium  in the netherlands and even  in spain graph 
summarizing these different studies we therefore see that france spends a lot on health but that its system is far from being the most efficient doctors are fewer in number and nurses are less well paid
how is it possible
when we look a little closer it is not the quantity but the distribution of expenses that seems to be the problem the french system has an efficiency deficit as the court of auditors points out each year the health system consumes a lot of resources but offers results that are not commensurate with the means deployed
the causes are multiple administrative complexity development of technostructure too many administrative tasks to the detriment of operational tasks etc
the problem is in the economic and political system which does not really like to invest when the return is not immediate which is naturally the case with health when we know that unpredictability costs even more example illustrating these remarks health research is in a miserable state in france  billion invested in france against  billion in germany for example
an essential tool for the proper functioning of our health system the hospital also seems totally abandoned the health crisis we are going through has only highlighted the difficulties and demands of the hospital world that have existed for many years where hospitals are asking for more resources the state is asking for hundreds of millions in savings each year
personally i did not applaud the caregivers at  pm because i have never done so before when they were saving lives long before this virus everyone has known about the disastrous situation of french hospitals for years and no one cared i also think back to this january   when in front of the ministry of health i attended a demonstration by nurses who demanded more resources i was surprised that no media or public words relayed it me first
what desirable future for our health system
if this virus has one merit it is that of putting health back at the heart of our concerns
thus in order to avoid a collapse of our health system it is important to learn the lessons of this crisis and to question it through  issues anticipate rethink and prioritize
first there is a need to have a forwardlooking vision shared by all stakeholders of future health issues in order to better anticipate them
then we must rethink the organization of care by strengthening the links between local elected officials and the ars and by making these organizations more agile similarly collaboration between city medicine and the hospital must be developed in order to guarantee optimal patient care
the hospital of tomorrow will also go through the development of environmental health the right care at the lowest cost or even the development of our prevention and research systems
also it is important to prioritize investments and as claude evin very rightly points out the revaluation of remuneration is a priority not only to honor staff who have spent themselves selflessly but because insufficient remuneration does not make these careers attractive it is also necessary to invest in equipment and to restore certain buildings but in a context of budgetary constraints it will be necessary to prioritize

after block walking over the past two months and talking face to face with residents in district  the most important issues that need to be addressed next session are property taxes and school finance property taxes in texas are skyrocketing from local governments accruing too much debt and wasteful spending school districts are also accruing too much debt and spending too much money on administration facility expenses and overhead the rising debt is forcing cities  to lower spending on necessary services such as fire and police protection more recently cities are resorting to extreme measures to find additional revenue sources by aggressively annexing rural land such as private ranches to extend its boundaries with the sole purpose of increasing its tax base however such drastic measures of aggressive annexation only create more problems as cities have more areas to service with police and fire causing a strain on existing services within the city the result is more crime and less protection when elected i will work to implement a system of transparency and a higher level of scrutiny when local governments and school districts issue debt such as bonds i will also work to end robinhood and find a more equitable system of public school finance in texas in addition to property taxes i will work hard to achieve a higher level of protection and consent from residents and ranch owners when cities try to annex private property and other significant actions by cities i have the experience and expertise to lead the charge in the texas house,1

question  since being eliminated from the gubernatorial race this year i reflect back to an article i submitted nearly a year ago october th  regarding question  not only am i an energy advocate i believe i was in the best position to speak on energy since i was the only candidate who had firsthand experience in energy and costs to the end user both business and residential i once again am disappointed with the ridiculous nevada politics and selfish leaders  in our communities that have twisted such a positive and good initiative seriously it is pathetic that said this is what i submitted last year and still stands true to today as a past candidate for governor who released an innovative and visionary plan for the future of energy in nevada i found it curious that i was left out of the nevada independent october th article on question  of the four candidates that were interviewed two had tepid support one wouldnt voice an opinion and one couldnt even remember his position on the ballot question to say the least all of their answers were very disappointing first of all lets be clear about the energy choice initiative if the voters pass the initiative a second time in  whether or not the governor personally backs the initiative is irrelevant whomever is the future governor of nevada will be tasked with implementing the plan per the will of the people secondly its unimaginable that any candidate for governor would waiver in their support for the energy choice initiative referring back to the october th article by riley snider our future governor must work diligently with the legislature to ensure that it is successfully executed more than ever people are showing a preference for choice in their daily lives in nevada this includes where and from whom they can purchase their electricity they started the process  and will finish the job in  while there are inherent risks of energy costs going up in the short term as the move to a competitive retail electricity market takes place and is finetuned years of business experiences prove that competition drives prices down and not just for businesses but for private citizens community organizations government entities and more an energy choice policy in place will make it more affordable for companies to do business in nevada that will mean more jobs more revenue and more tax dollars for our state we have worked so hard on making nevada a friendly state for renewable energy an energy choice policy will actually drive energy companies focused on renewables into our state creating still more jobs and satisfying nevada and californias thirst for clean energy rather than sending goodpaying renewable energy jobs to germany and china we can bring them to our state and make nevada the go to place and recognized leader in renewable energy employment education research and investment nevadas energy future should be a major part of our next governors platform because of its effect on jobs revenue business development education and so much more energy will be a way for nevada to break out of its tourism heavy economy and pave the way for a new future combine that with the fact that chances are very good the people of nevada will approve the initiative a second time in  i would hope that every candidate for governors support for the energy choice initiative is solid and unwavering they should ensure it realizes its tremendous potential to benefit our state jared fisher past candidate for nevada governor,1

"let is open a discussion on which economic policy for microenterprises as an alternative to the welfare policy proposed by the conte government and its majority
the motion by dario boilini presented to the committee of italian radicals in may  faces and tries to compete with the world of microenterprises in the new postpandemic covid economic reality
starting from the premise that the set of microenterprises suffers more than others the distortions of the country system in reference to bureaucracy and the difficulty of accessing credit and that the effects of the pandemic will have a potentially destructive impact on this area which represents  of italians who derive sustenance from their activity proposes a political initiative that goes to support microenterprises understood as that natural pool of professionals selfemployed workers vat numbers and companies with less than  employees a natural pool of subjects interested in liberal liberal and libertarian policies for the liberal revolution and for the united states of europe 
the merit of this proposal also represents its main limitation that is it groups and homogenizes very different economic subjects there are professionals both registered with professional associations and simple vat numbers and businesses and even among the latter a distinction should be made between manufacturing enterprises and service enterprises without forgetting the primary sector that is the agricultural sector where organized enterprises coexist with activities which on the other hand are distinguished by an individual character direct farmers
agriculture is perhaps the sector that has been least affected by the crisis with some exceptions
each of these subjects has specific peculiarities regarding the difficulties deriving from the long lockdown
manufacturing companies need liquidity to be able to invest in the raw materials or semifinished necessary for their production cycle and cover the depreciation of investments in structures and machinery in addition to personnel costs for which in case of need they can access the redundancy fund which as a rule is triggered by more than  employees but which in the current situation is also applied to companies with fewer employees
otherwise service companies have as their main cost that represented by the cost of employees but also in this case the redundancy fund has intervened
particular is the case of the professions among these we can distinguish between those enrolled in professional associations accountants lawyers doctors engineers surveyors architects commercial agents etc and those who do not have this characteristic among the latter the majority carry out disguised dependent work
we think of software programmers business brokers sales promoters etc these are probably the weakest subjects in today is reality
one of the aspects that distinguishes the discussion on economic issues is what type of intervention should be done considering that the financial capacity of the italian state characterized by a large debt is more limited than other european partners
assistancetype interventions subsidies or interventions aimed at increasing the investment capacity of companies strengthening their financial capacity
the choice depends on the economic prospects we have
the subsidy intervenes in a situation of difficulty in terms of immediate consumption
increasing the financial capacity of companies means creating the conditions for greater investment capacity and therefore for a faster economic recovery
however to be fair firms invest when the economic outlook is optimistic
the criticisms that have been brought to the latest government decree concern the benefits that are paid above all in terms of subsidies and therefore do not create the premises for a recovery criticisms made by the new president of confindustria bonomi by economists including tria and others by della vedova secretary of europe
we cannot fail to bear in mind what is a structural characteristic of most italian companies and of which the microenterprises area is the prototype the small size a substantial undercapitalization and a still too widespread prevalence of the family business which precludes to qualified external managerial entrances
all this generates an industrial structure in which investments in research development are lower than those of international competitors but it also produces another peculiarity the high birth of new businesses linked to an equally high mortality which causes damage to the economic system as a whole banks creditors employees etc
bearing in mind that medium and large companies are almost always the terminal of a production chain the fca with  thousand employees has an induction of  thousand employees the difficulties of small enterprises in adapting to new it and telematic systems create problems for them as now the logistics and the warehouse are managed in an automated way
another aspect that characterizes the economists discussion is whether the liquidity injections should be aimed at all companies or only those that have prospects for greater economic development
allocate resources to those who have survival as their sole objective or direct them towards those with greater development capacity who is able to identify the deserving ones
given that this discussion does not have the current government as its horizon which is characterized by a venezuelan model statism capable of even imposing the right state price on surgical masks with the result of making them unavailable in all italian pharmacies from north to south the good question remains also for a next political phase called to manage the severe economic and social crisis in the coming months with what criteria
last but not least the bureaucracy by now the business system is caged in a system of rules that discourages investments in almost all economic activities be it the small shop or the large business
authorizations and permits are subject to a myriad of initiatives that intersect in such a way as to create difficulties that are difficult to overcome the story of the reconstruction of the morandi bridge which collapsed in august  in genoa and today after only  months rebuilt in defiance of the italian legal jungle should be the guiding star with which to address the discussion and political proposals for to debureaucratize and relaunch the italian economy
keeping in mind that obstacles are always present even in the procedures of public offices
when the practice provides that the applications are subject to visas authorizations and or permits from different administrations it is almost certain that the procedure will meet biblical times
often the request is rebuffed from one institution to another due to the lack of documents required by the legislation even if substantially superfluous furthermore the lack of dialogue skills between the it systems of the various administrations when they are present obliges the sending of paper documents with further delay
in all this it should be remembered that in our criminal code there is a crime abuse of office art  cp
today the procedures are managed by the managers and not by the mayors who only have a political power the fear of incurring in this type of crime which has recently seen a worsening of the sentence from  to  years generates an attitude that to say prudent is euphemistic in the management of the procedures
today is the time to open a nonideological discussion and promote a courageous political initiative with proposals for real simplification and debureaucratization this is the real save italy capable of producing economic and social development as an alternative to the current venezuelan antiindustrial majority

"the dolo hospital returns to normal
veneto withzaia
dolo after the covid emergency also the hospital surgery resumed its activity
never had any doubts about the restart of our surgery explains the chief of general surgery of the dolo hospital dr mario godina and not for this reason it was less exciting yesterday he continues not only for me but also for my collaborators to enter again those operating theaters that here at the dolo hospital were destined for the covid emergency after a little midmarch
the hospital has played in this emergency continues the chief of surgery a very important role in the fight against covid of which we are proud we in general surgery however knew that returning to our premises was only a matter of time it was necessary to temporarily dedicate them to this emergency in which our hospital played a strategic role for the population and for ulss  serenissima we did our part because we are part of the same team and we did it for our citizens  now the resumption of service as he himself defines it is experienced fully and with satisfaction also by surgeons anesthetists nurses and sociohealth workers
the coronavirus emergency has not yet ended but the dolo hospital is returning without uncertainty to normality and its role as a reference hospital for the area in the first week of may radiological activity polyclinic activity and that relating to blood sampling resumed last week then the surgical outpatient activity resumed with the carrying out of visits already almost eighty for small operations such as the removal of skin growths and small lipomas and these types of operations have been
in recent days then the activity of the surgical department has also restarted which also concerns the major interventions performed right in the north block of the operating theaters reactivated and functioning already on monday we started with oncological interventions underlines the head physician and with an emergency intervention but everything has restarted in view of laparoscopic surgery which is the flagship of this surgery and which where the conditions arise is chosen precisely for its minimally invasive nature
the dolo surgery stands out not only for oncological surgery but also for the treatment of obesity we have left in these hours with visits to the bariatric surgery clinic planning the next operations it should be remembered that for this type of problem which is increasingly frequent in the western world dolo surgery has received accreditation as a qualified center by the scientific society of the italian society of obesity surgery sicob it is now about sixteen years that the surgical department of dolo has decided to devote itself to the topic of bariatric surgery acquiring over time a recognized experience and competence our department said dr godina is equipped with a bariatric clinic and is adequately equipped starting from simple furnishings such as the hospital bed to accommodate and treat the obese patient taking charge because not all obese patients can access surgery takes place here through a multidisciplinary team in order to be able to undergo the surgical treatment performed laparoscopically the patient must have the authorization of this team made up of several professionals",1

"radical animal extremist group files petitions with the us surgeon general and president trump to close livestock markets
the covid pandemic has brought worldwide turmoil and a broad spectrum of problems from the physical effects the virus itself can have to the financial struggles of millions unemployed by widespread shutdowns add to this the unscrupulous animal extremist groups that are attempting to further their agenda in the wake of this pandemic many american families struggle to keep food on their tables as they face unemployment and the reality of a greatly disrupted national food supply chain one particular group the physicians committee for responsible medicine pcrm is actively seeking to exacerbate food insecurity in the united states by petitioning lawmakers to close live animal markets as well as meat processing plants
false claims and more petitions
on april   the group filed a legal petition for rulemaking with the us surgeon general to demand that all live animal markets in the united states be shut down immediately due to the role played by the wuhan china huanan seafood wholesale market in spreading the virus pcrm makes the false claim that any type of animal market has the potential to spread covid from animals to humans
in addition the group is petitioning president trump to rescind his order for united states meat processing plants to remain open pcrm is shameless maneuvering during a time when americans are already suffering from loss of income and shortages of essential goods demonstrates the group is incredible disconnect from reality disregard for the true wellbeing of the population and degree of extremist zealotry
with numerous meat packing plants closed or greatly limited due to a shortage of workers caused by covid america is getting a painful glimpse of what even a partial shutdown of the meat industry means for the publicsparsely stocked meat cases at the grocery store
meanwhile for some sectors of the animal agriculture industry even a limited number of closed plants have forced the euphemistically phrased depopulation of surplus animalsthousands of healthy finished meat animals wastefully destroyed for lack of somewhere to send them to be processed into meat and byproducts and no other options to house them
if pcrm had its way this situation would overtake all of animal agriculture in the name of covid and result in the entirely wasteful deaths of literally millions of animals that would otherwise become part of the nation is food and product supply chain the effects of such a grim and needless scenario would spread far beyond the direct ruin of producers the food industry would be far from the only one affected since byproducts of meat production are essential components in countless everyday items used by virtually every person in the united states
livestock is vital role in the overall food cycle
pcrm willfully turns a blind eye to the vital role that livestock production plays in the overall food cycle for example livestock can graze and thrive in areas that cannot be used to grow crops livestock can also utilize byproducts of crop production and other food waste that are unconsumable for humans in addition manure from cattle feedlots is used to fertilize crop fields that grow grains and vegetables
platform of fallacies
even in normal times and in the extremely unlikely scenario that the entire general populace would convert to veganism it would be impossible to sustainably and efficiently produce the sheer amount of plant products to feed and adequately nourish one nation much less the world
it is easy to see how pcrm is entire platform is based upon fallacies fallacies that are necessary for them to dupe people into supporting their agenda
given the group is long history of illveiled deceptions though it is really no surprise
prcmwho they really are
physicians committee for responsible medicine was founded in  by neal barnard barnard wrote  books between  and  and in  founded the barnard medical center as part of pcrm he was nominated for induction into the animal rights hall of fame in  barnard is training was in psychiatry but he has spent the majority of his career masquerading as an expert in nutrition promoting strict veganism and denigrating the use of animal products and animals in medicine and research this has all been under the guise of advocating for human health his namesake clinic adheres to the animal extremist ideology irresponsibly treating patients with veganism as blanket cure for all manner of diseases and conditions
less than  of prcm members are actual physicians
pcrm is name itself the physicians committee for responsible medicine is very blatantly and intentionally misleading currently less than  of reported members are actual physicians the true number of pcrm members that are genuine medical professionals is also highly questionable since anyone with or without credentials can join the watchdog group activist facts website states pcrm has successfully duped the media and much of the general public into believing that its pronouncements about the superiority of vegetarianonly diets represent the opinion of the medical community
prcm opposes lifesaving use of animals and campaigns against respected health charities
in addition to promoting veganism pcrm fanatically opposes the lifesaving use of animals in the medical field from research to the animalderived products essential for numerous medical materials and medicines the group has actively and aggressively campaigned against numerous widely respected health charities that support and utilize animal research to help cure human diseasesgroups such as the american heart association the american cancer society st jude children is research hospital the american foundation for aids research the christopher reeve paralysis foundation the american red cross and the march of dimes
prcm is harshly criticized by physicians and the american medical association
pcrm has been harshly criticized by a number of doctors and medical groups the american medical association ama once referred to pcrm as a fringe organization that employs unethical tactics and is interested in perverting medical science montreal quebec is mcgill university chemist dr joe schwarcz called pcrm a fanatical animal rights group with a clearcut agenda of promoting a vegan lifestyle that masquerades as a just scientific body
one former director of research for the center for consumer freedom stated neal barnard is using his latest book to disguise animal rights propaganda as medical advicemost americans are too smart to take dietary advice from peta but that is exactly what you get with barnard is antimeat recommendations
prcm has connections to radical animal extremist groups
it stands to reason that barnard and pcrm have had long and welldocumented interconnectedness with groups like the people for the ethical treatment of animals peta and other animal extremist groups including two that were considered to be domestic terrorist threats by the department of justice animal liberation front alf and shac stop huntingdon animal cruelty
former pcrm spokesperson dr jerry vlasak was quoted as saying i think there is a use for violence in our movement and i think it can be an effective strategy not only is it morally acceptable i think that there are places where it could be used quite effectively from a pragmatic standpoint and i dont think youd have to kill assassinate too many vivisectors before you would see a marked decrease in the amount of vivisection going on and i think for  lives  lives  human lives we could save a million  million  million nonhuman animals people get all excited about oh what is going to happen when the alf accidentally kills somebody in an arson well you know i mean i think we need to get used to this idea it is going to happen okay it is going to happen
pcrm does not openly advocate violence and thus distanced itself from vlasak but actively works to hide its ties to peta and other blatant animal extremist groups to help maintain the charade of being simply doctors advocating for human health
prcm founder has served as peta is medical advisor
the deep ties between pcrm and peta are not only ideological but have been financial and operational as well over the years barnard has shared professional and allegedly even personal relationships with peta is leader ingrid newkirk barnard has served as peta is medical advisor and has penned numerous articles as such he also served on the board of the peta foundation now known as the foundation to support animal protection
smoke mirrors and money
hundreds of thousands of dollars have been funneled to pcrm from peta via the foundation it is a common tactic among animal extremist groups to branch out and share members and leadership it serves as smoke and mirrors when resources are diverted or pooled among such groups as well as to present a facade of credibility to the public when such groups quote one another
it is easy to see why pcrm has been referred to as peta is labcoated sibling in ad campaigns similar to those of peta pcrm has claimed that animal products are equivalent to drugs and that feeding children animal products is the same as child abuse relying on shock value to catch attention and earn support from the uninformed examples of pcrm ads are an image of a corpse on a gurney holding a hamburger and of the wisconsin cheesehead on a grim reaper figure
in a time when concerns about public health are at the forefront it is reprehensible that pcrm is preying on society is fears to further their barelycloaked extremist agenda further to vie for the complete and total disruption of an already struggling food supply system and the unavoidable suffering that would follow is nothing short of sadism",1

"small steps big steps
from today on we will be discussing the  budget for  days a budget that was created in times of corona and probably cannot and will not last the economic researchers are too far apart in their estimates some are talking about a  minus others are assuming a  minus in economic growth where we will really end up and how the income will develop we will probably only see in the autumn dont tell me says the former rector of wu and current head of wifo bardelt
so why a budget decision after all the alternative would be to update the  budget but then there are the many small and large measures especially in the ecological area not then no tenfold increase in the bicycle budget then no  million for greening the rivers then no  million for the expansion of public transport all measures that will ultimately help the economy and secure jobs
speaking of securing the economy and jobs greenpeace published a study this morning according to which  of the people in austria expect and demand a green economic stimulus package an ecosocial economic stimulus package  of the people in the country say they are feeling the effects of the climate crisis so it is finally time to take measures and combine them with the economic stimulus measures required after covid the press release from greenpeace austria can be found at there you can also find a link to the entire survey
it is about more public transport it is about sustainable work sustainable building it is about solar systems on all public roofs it is about thermal renovation the expansion of cycle paths and sidewalks and and and we take this survey with us as additional motivation it is a first step towards more green money further larger steps must follow and will follow",1

why did gallup omit its own holocaust poll by rafael medoff gallups editorinchief spoke at the united states holocaust memorial museum on november  and described polls his organization took in the s and early s which showed overwhelming opposition to the admission of jewish refugees fleeing the nazis yet somehow he forgot to mention the single most important poll that gallup took during those yearsa poll which showed exactly the opposite of all the others what can account for this peculiar omission the event at the museum in washington dc featured gallups top editor frank newport together with daniel greene the lead curator of the museums controversial new exhibit americans and the holocaust the notsosubtle theme of the exhibit is that president franklin d roosevelt was virtually helpless to assist jews fleeing hitler because american public opinion was so heavily opposed to admitting them polls taken by gallup and others during those years play a major role in the exhibit large litup boxes throughout the exhibit present the questions from the polls and the results was the persecution of jews in europe their own fault sixtyfive percent of americans said the jews were partly or entirely to blame april  in the wake of the nazis horrific kristallnacht pogrom should america admit more german jews ninetyfour percent disapproved of the pogrom but  percent were against admitting refugees november  should the us admit  children from germany sixtyseven percent said no january  reproductions of those question boxes appeared on a large screen behind frank newport as he discussed the poll results in his remarks at the museum clearly he was intimately familiar with the material he described founder george gallups work methods in great detail he shared anecdotes about gallup and his family he described gallups impact on american society but then something strange happened after discussing polls from the s and  and  gallup and curator greene suddenly leapfrogged over the rest of world war ii and went straight to the postwar period they claimed that american public opposition to admitting refugees continued throughout the war and afterwards but the truth is that there was a very significant shiftaccording to a poll that gallup itself took in  in the middle of the war and the middle of the holocaust what happened is that a small us government agency the war refugee board proposed to president roosevelt in early  that he should grant temporary haven to hundreds of thousands of jewish refugees until the end of the war to test the waters of public opinion on the proposal the white house commissioned a gallup poll in april of  gallup found that  percent of the public supported giving temporary protection and refuge in the united states to those people in europe who have been persecuted by the nazis how is it that public opinion had changed so much from previous polling most americans felt sympathy for european jews but had viewed refugees as a threat to their jobs or to national security but the shift to a wartime economy completed america is emergence from the great depression and as the tide of the war turned in  the liberation of north africa the defeat of the germans at stalingrad the withdrawal of italy from the war the publics fear of refugees either as competing workers or disguised as nazi spies diminished and its willingness to make humanitarian gestures increased gallups april  poll was taken more than a year before the end of the war it was late but it was not too late to rescue a significant number of jewish refugees if only president roosevelt had shown an interest in doing soand as the poll showed he would have enjoyed ample public support for such action sadly he agreed to grant temporary haven to just one token group of  refugees that crucial poll is omitted from the holocaust museums new exhibit which is one of the reasons that many holocaust scholars have criticized it acknowledging the wartime shift of public opinion would upset the exhibits underlying theme of minimizing president roosevelts abandonment of the jews visitors would realize that the presidents hands were not completely tied after all its bad enough that the museum curators simply omitted the  percent poll from the exhibit but it adds insult to inaccuracy for gallups editorinchief to have done likewise in his remarks at the museum and on gallups website an essay by newport on the site is marred by the same omission in fact the essay is accompanied by a chart listing gallup polls from the s and s about refugeesand once again the telltale  poll is missing newport did not respond to requests for comment gallup is supposed to be measuring public opinion not trying to reshape historical perceptions by selectively showcasing only those poll results that support a particular narrative dr rafael medoff is founding director of the david s wyman institute for holocaust studies and the author of the jews should keep

good news the national trust for canada has announced this morning that the minchau blacksmith shop in old strathcona has officially made it onto the top  endangered places list in canada this will bring much needed attention to its historical relevance and to a wider public and political platform but much work is still needed to save the minchau blacksmith shop as it still does not have an official registered designation bad news the minchau blacksmith shop has made  it onto the top  endangered places list in canada its fate is hanging in the balance right now as are so many historical buildings across canada the fact that it has gotten this far and so close to possible demolition is loudly indicative of the rights of developers everywhere and the acquiescence of our governments note that weak legislation and inadequate financial incentives in alberta are a main threat to historic structural buildings giving developers far too much reach fortunately there is a groundswell movement happening right now which is being felt and recognized as we spread the word farther to stop the demolition of our historical buildings and more people become aware and write letters to our municipal and provincial governments and federal it gets more difficult for the government elect to ignore the issue at hand and the people who voted them into office we can only hope that some developers have a similar sense of community and will also step up to the plate and help preserve our historical heritage buildings please join us and please continue to write the provincial government who has the power to designate the minchau blacksmith shop an official historic heritage site and the municipal government at city hall who can take a bigger stand in dialogue with the developer and aid in stopping the demolition share our page with friends and family like our page to receive ongoing posts encourage others to send an email to government and write again and again if you want our numbers need to go up please see below for email address to send letters to ironically blacksmiths were the cornerstone of growth and development for their communities in every part of the world and throughout history in our short canadian farming and industrial history blacksmiths were the critical component in advancing our country and our society to an equivalent status as that of europe and other countries particularly in the early part of the twentieth century homes buildings vehicles and industrial equipment were no longer held together by tongue and groove boarding and wooden pegs homes and buildings incorporated nails and other metal and steel implements in their construction and became more solid wagons gave way to carriages and then automobiles the walking plow gave way to better farm tools equipment and tractors and all because of a blacksmith is knowledge of metals forging and welding and his required skills we all share in the benefits of modernization and we all share in the history that precedes it this should not be so difficult for our governments to recognize the value of the two that they can in fact coexist together side by side each with their own intrinsic beauty and thoughtfully forged together with the precision like that of a blacksmith to build a bigger better stronger and healthier society we as a nation recognize our historical buildings as important to the value of our heritage we as a nation and as edmontonians and albertans recognize our heritage as important to the value of being a canadian citizen if developers and our governments continue to neglect and demolish our historical buildings there will be no heritage left there will be no tangible connection to our past to developers and our elected government body of officials we are not against the fair and reasonable development of new buildings or new ideas we all share in the benefits of modernization but we stand against the demolition of our historical buildings please designate the minchau blacksmith shop an official registered historical heritage site and stop the demolition we thank the national trust for canada in recognizing the historical and heritage value of the a minchau blacksmith shop in the historical and cultural district of old strathcona and for placing it on the top  endangered places list in canada we know our work is not done and we value our relationship with your people in ottawa if you are new to our page take a moment to read through the previously written posts and please take a moment to send an email to the provincial government and to city hall help us to stop the demolition of the a minchau blacksmith shop in old strathcona and to have it designated a historical heritage site via the provincial government please send emails to culturetourismministergovabca ricardo miranda  minister of culture and tourism premiergovabca premier rachel notley in subject header write designate the minchau

"is tampa bay times still relevant
what is the purpose of journalism
journalism is a method of inquiry and literary style used in social and cultural representation it serves the purpose of playing the role of public service machinery in the dissemination and analysis of news and information
what is a journalist is oath
the journalist is creed is a personal affirmation of journalism ethics written by walter williams in 
what are the universal principles that guide journalism
five core principles of journalism
 truth and accuracy
 independence
 fairness and impartiality
 humanity
 accountability
what are the ethical responsibilities of a journalist
ethical journalism has to be fair and truthful a journalist must take responsibility for their work provide contextual information update their work to fit with current changes when necessary identify their sources with clarity and ensure that they understand the motives of their sources
why do journalists need professional ethics
one of the major reasons journalists need professional ethics is the fact that these ethics can act as a fantastic guide to help journalists deal with ethical situations that they encounter in the course of performing their duties
i believe that the tampa bay times tbt acts more and more like a social media platform and has been slowly moving away from the five core principles of journalism after tbt is latest round of endorsements in this election cycle the paper took a giant leap further and further away from journalistic objectivity and integrity
i will use three specific political endorsements made by the editorial board of tbt and test the core principles against them keep in mind this is a solo effort i have limited resources to compare with the limitless resource and access that the paper has also when the editorial board of any journalism paper is involved in a decision they have a fiduciary duty to adhere to the the five core principles of journalism
school board district  np
tbt endorsed karl nurse in this district
let us test this endorsement against some of the five core principles of journalism
fairness and impartiality i cannot see how endorsing a wealthy business owner who has no issue taking a political demotion as a prior city council member to run for school board is fair he does not have any experience at the k school level relevant to the position except the adoption of one school in one specific neighborhood
humanity any responsible business should practice social corporate responsibility especially journalism we all have a duty to improve our environment it is not all about dollars and cents as a matter of fact the wiser business executives will tell you that social corporate responsibility and community engagement significantly improves the bottom line having said that by backing karl nurse tbt would like us to believe that a whiteonly school board is appropriate for our diverse public school system and our county
i do not think so we need diversity that can lead to inclusion at all levels of government and the fact that the editorial board failed to deliver this diversity by not choosing a wellqualified teacher and public school advocate is a degradation of the integrity of journalism
school board district  np
here tbt endorsed laura hine
let us test this endorsement against some of the five core principles of journalism
truth and accuracy i happen to be a parent at the school where mrs hine would like to claim credit i can tell you this endorsement is totally wrong did the editorial group of tbt reach out to a representative population of the school to validate her claim
no
i have been at the school for  years where this candidate tries to claim credit here is the truth i was there and tbt was not during my daughters last  years the north shore zone shifted  blocks to the south side to help improve minority students achievement the presence of these kids prompted a bulk of white wealthy parents to leave the school this exodus brought the school grade to a d we stayed and continually supported the school which despite the grade continually has had wonderful teachers and enriching programs over time the achievement gap leveled off and the school was a b when we registered our son jb for kindergarten and has bounced between a b and c ever since including  when laura hine joined my family and her group friends of north shore elementary fnse butted heads often over inclusion as a necessary component of diversity it is not enough to get a token seat at the table we need to be welcomed as equal stakeholders there was a total lack of understanding of the nuances between equality and equity all of mrs hine is programs were equal but not every student had equal access to these programs the group could not understand that the initiatives and programs they championed ignored social cultural opportunity and socioeconomic differences in our population that actually increased the achievement gap in spite of our attempts to inform them mrs hine got white parents to come back to the school in greater numbers but was this reverse migration better or worse for the marginalized students that were doing well before let us look at the available equity data at our disposal
the data reflects that disadvantaged students at north shore elementary are falling behind other students in the state and the achievement gap at the school is increasingly significant
the school is  white  black  hispanic and  other low income students made up  of the school population
the data also reflects that some student groups are not getting the support they need to succeed the suspension rate of white children is only  while all other groups combined suspension rate is  these issues show up in areas of academic rigor as well as there are no black children identified as gifted at north shore
with this endorsement the tbt is rewarding and praising these citizens for finally performing their civic duty to engage with their public school while failing the most vulnerable for the sake of accuracy mrs hine was always running for office from the time i met her this notion that she opted to run to save our public schools against the tyranny of a proprivate school candidate is inaccurate and frankly laughable
accountability if tbt had done due diligence in this endorsement they would have at least requested north shore elementary pta is meeting minutes to verify her claims in this case they would have noticed the many ways in which diversity and inclusion were not deliberate but more of a burden to bear by the fnse members of the pta a recurring line item mentioning teachersstaff pay by the pta would have also raised some concerns
pinellas tax collector is office
here tbt endorsed an employee of the pinellas tax collector is office joyell bobala who quit her job at the office just in time to run
this is the only example where i actually have available performance data on both candidates recorded by the entity in question the critique of this endorsement is strictly data driven after i made a thorough public records request which tbt would have been ethically required to do but clearly did not my conclusion of this endorsement is that it goes against all five core principles of journalism truth and accuracy independence fairness and impartiality humanity and accountability
this endorsement is such a gross dereliction of duty the tbt editorial board took the opinion of the former tax collector diane nelson as the primary motivator for its decision rather than facts and evidence this endorsement is intentionally without journalistic integrity and is based solely on gossip and political favoritism
let us dive into the data available for debate and analysis
it is evident that the current tax collector adopted a modernized and datadriven model to serve the county residents this action insulted the previous tax collector and she is now fully engaged in an effort to replace him with mediocre lowlevel staff loyal to her and the past
we will stick with the available data
according to the endorsement mrs nelson stated that wait times doubled the record showed the following wait time in fact doubled while customer and employee satisfaction are at their highest
why is this
customer and employee satisfaction are the best indicators of performance by any service provider customer satisfaction is not simply based on wait times but in the accuracy of the transaction and the fewest number of visits needed to get the job done it is an overall experience between the customer and the employee the data shows that although wait times were less under mrs nelson customer satisfaction and employee is efficacy were also lower let us see the raw data for customer followed by employee satisfaction rating
customer satisfaction in   in    
overall employee satisfaction of pinellas county tax collector employees from  to  is 
the endorsement of the candidate also included one comment from an employee engagement survey any reasonable individual would agree that it is impossible to please everyone however picking one negative comment when the preponderance of the survey results were very positive is deceptive and selfserving at best
according to the employee engagement data i received the majority of employees were quite satisfied and happy with their working environment
here are some recent positive comments from the same survey regarding the current tax collector
 the leadership is to be commended for their efforts to address last year is survey feedback i have personally seen enhanced effort at building transparency and accessibility the info presented at in service day this year was the most straightforward it has ever been and many decisions were clearly made with the employees best interests in mind
 my answers have changed a lot over the years every year i notice more and more improvement i dont remember the last time i was able to choose strongly agree agree for every question thank you for continuing to make this a great place to work and each time we need you to you show us you care about our health safety wellbeing it is noticed and appreciated
 by far this is my favorite job ever from the training program to the people there isnt anything i would change
if i were to play the same unethical game that tbt is engaged in i would look at employee engagement surveys from when mrs nelson was in charge and pick the following comments
 sometimes i feel like the time waited issue gets in the way of customer service there is such a concern in getting the customers in and out as fast as we can it can lead to rushing through situations where mistakes are made on a registration title or driver is license this then reflects poorly on the employees review i understand and it sure seems the customers do too that waiting for issues at the dmv is a way of life and we do it really well here but rushing through customers albeit can lead to good times but it can also lead to mistakes on the paperwork i dont think we should slow down for slow down sake maybe just put less emphasis on the time issue and more on the  mistake issue
 mean what you say even in the top left corner of the page i am looking at it says world class service anytime anyplace that is not what is preached it is all about getting people out the door and keeping times below the red dont answer questions for people outside of work dont offer services of other county offices
 be fairer and avoid favoritism when promoting an employee be more careful in choosing the right person with the preparation and abilities needed to effectively exercise a supervisory or position we observed several times how unfair is gone when the promote an employee
 stop the favoritism a lot of people get promotions or moved to a different area of the office because they are liked more then sic others or because of who they are related too this has happened for a long time but it is happening more now then sic ever
the data also shows a more diverse executive leadership team something that mrs nelson was not concerned with and i am afraid with this endorsement neither is tbt the agency is website depicts an agile and responsive front line to the rapidly changing needs of the citizens i also see an agency moving towards increasing accessibility specifically online and through kiosks in grocery stores this approach is proactive and forward looking
a significant data point that is often overlooked is the amount of retirees that occur with new leadership the amount of retirees did not significantly change over the past three years usually the dire and ineffective environment portrayed by mrs bobala which is amplified by mrs nelson should have yielded a noticeable increase in the number of retirees yet there was no such an exodus of eligible employees to retire   retirements   retirements   retirements
let us look at joyell bobala as a candidate according to public records the candidate was given a lateral transfer for failure to perform mrs bobala was supervising the tax administration department at that capacity she interviewed hired and trained  new employees from  to  and mrs bobala failed to retain any of her own recruits while the entire tax collector is office turnover rate for new hires was  for the same time period including her  turnover rate given her past statements about the value of standardized training this failure is not a surprise
do we still need journalists
as popular as social media is we still need journalists social media news is constantly clouded with people is opinions so we need journalists to report clarify and fact check everything we see and hear on social media what can we do when our journalists are acting like a biased opinionbased platform that is no different from unchecked social media
i say we need to call them out and hold them accountable to the values and principles of their profession their objectivity is needed in order to sustain our democratic system there is nothing more valuable than a free press to our system of government this is why we should not accept this bought and paid for form of journalism i am annoyed and disappointed that i must fact check my local paper and it brings no joy editorials represent the institutional opinion of the tampa bay times the collective opinions of the chairman and ceo paul tash editor of editorials tim nickens and editorial writers elizabeth djinis john hill and jim verhulst tell us that we should elect a fully white school board that includes an inexperienced parent who became aware of our public schools issues only when it affected her family and lastly tbt would like to tell us that our tax collector is office is better off in the hands of a low level unproductive and bitter ex employee that does not believe in standardized training for all as a means to bring equity in our public service system
is tbt against racial justice equitable schools and fair workplaces
i cannot tell but what i can tell for sure is that tbt has not been a friend in the fight for a better and inclusive community that can work for all
it is not a zero sum game

of ventura county is facing prohibitive and dangerous regulations  the ventura county wildlife corridor and its impact  more than public lands in january  in a  vote the ventura county board of supervisors advised the planning division to study potential new restrictions and regulations covering  acres approximately  of ventura county this includes  acres of both public and private property that cuts through the heart of ventura county nam  ing it the habitat connectivity and wildlife movement corridors then in august of  the county of ventura proposed to add additional restrictions and regulations what ventura county residents need to know is that the county board of supervisors is moving fast they are pushing to implement the wildlife corridor zoning ordinance and its related land use restrictions and regulations in march of  new regulations and restrictions will devastate local families and farms and restrict public use the ventura county supervisors plan to create a habitat connectivity wildlife corridor overlay zone which imposes a myriad of new regulations and restrictions for landowners within that zone they would identify additional overlay areas and title them critical wildlife passage areas that includes even more restrictions essentially ventura county properties could be subject to  sets of zoning regulations  the base set of zoning regulations depending on category for example residential commercial rural agricultural  the habitat connectivity and wildlife movement corridor zone  the critical wildlife passage areas the impact of this on landowners and the community will be devastating the new restrictions and regulations on both public and private property encompass  fencing installation or replacement  lighting installation or replacement including removal of existing lighting no longer permitted under the conditions of the new ordinance other lighting restrictions will be enforced including height direction color and hours  eliminating nonnative invasive plants  restricting vegetation removal including fire prevention and mitigation measures  designation of wildlife passage areas across farmland with no scientific studies  building of new structures and fencing on properties in the wildlife passage areas would require environmental analysis or setting aside half of the land to revert to its natural state for wildlife habitat  awarding the planning director the discretionary power to control and even deny every aspect of basic property improvements that are not specifically exempt from the ordinance  requiring land owners to undergo a full environmental analysis of projects including houses barns lighting and fences before approval  expanding the size of surface water area buffer zones rendering many properties virtually unusable  conditional use permits will be in jeopardy of nonrenewal once they expire  preventing land owners from making improvements or rebuilding property like fencing barns and homes if damaged by fire or other natural disasters threat of increased wildfires impacts public safety new restrictive regulations preventing landowners from conducting fire prevention measures will increase the already dangerous threat of devastating wildfires for reference the thomas hill and woolsey fires scorched over  acres and burned over  structures the recent fires destroyed wildlife populations and their habitat the national park service estimates that the santa monica mountains lost half of its habitat in the fire burning  acres or  percent of the areas federal parkland wildlife critical passage areas  vague regulations the lack of clarity in these regulations would result in projects from simply installing fencing to planting crops in the county be subject to the discretion of the county planning director wildlife already travels through many areas of ventura county it is important to note that the original wildlife corridor zoning proposal was designed to maintain existing wildlife passage points not to create new ones no compensation to land owners essentially the wildlife corridor ordinance is a conservation easement with no compensation to land owners it does not provide any allowances for the individual needs of families who own and pay taxes on ventura county properties out of date data is being utilized many of the recommendations for the wildlife corridor are based off of studies and models conducted over  years ago as an example there is a corridor indicated on the new zoning map that fully encompasses the bell canyon subdivision landowners to bear the expense of out of date maps a surface water overlay map has been created showing how  foot buffer zones overlay properties within the wildlife corridor in ventura county however the map includes manmade features for example ponds and swimming pools that were purposely excluded in the ordinance language from new wildlife buffer zones landowners will have to pay county planners and consultant biologists to remove unintended restrictions on their land your voices need to be heard  attend the board of supervisors meeting if you are concerned about this proposed wildlife

i respectfully ask you to read below to explain why i deserve your vote on november   for a second term on cumberlands dr paul santoro for cumberland fire board  starting out as a volunteer firefighter at the station on the corner of mendon rd and route  when it was called the ashton fire department i learned from some excellent mentors that firefighting is a hazardous occupation the utilizes expensive vehicles and equipment as a fire board member for the last t  wo years i have worked hard maintaining a financially conservative approach while providing the cumberland fire department cfd with the equipment necessary to be the best fire department in the state about me i am a lifelong resident of cumberland and have a  yearold daughter who is a senior at uri i graduated from cumberland high school in  bryant university with a bs in business administration in  went to rhode island college for my pre med requirements  then i attended the chicago college of osteopathic medicine from  followed by my internshipresidency at newark beth israel medical center from  i am currently unable to practice full time medicine due to a congenital heart condition but am the medical director for rhode island dmatmrc as well as many other organizations i also teach at the physician assistant program at my alma mater bryant university as an adjunct professor what have i done in cumberland to earn your vote to be on the fire board for two more years as chairman of personnel subcommittee i met with the chief every  weeks for state of the stations updates we discussed issues ranging from the current number of firefighters out on injured on duty iod and their estimated return to work dates overall firefighter morale training updates vehicle and equipment status updates and anything else the chief wanted to discuss i took a proactive approach and we discussed injury prevention many times i suggested making the voluntary exercises and stretching routines mandatory to the chief and he researched it and found the proper nationally recognized guidelines to implement mandatory stretching we are working together to hopefully reduce injuries on duty which in turn will cost the taxpayers less money in the future this program is still a work in progress the chief would explain the condition of the vehicles and equipment as well as training within the department and town rescue service which leads to my role on the finance subcommittee its time to pay up now is the time for the town run rescue to pay the independent fire district for services rendered i strongly believe it is time for the town to start paying the cfd for the services we provide the rescue the town receives over  million dollars a year for the rescue services and the fire department gets zero dollars two thirds of our calls are to assist the rescue and we have had firefighters injured on these calls while the taxpayers of the fire district pay for the expense of these injuries the town makes the money furthermore i am sure many of you are aware that nowadays some rescue calls require two fire trucks which one could be our only ladder truck to be on scene for  minutes assisting the rescue that means that  six of the twelve on duty are assisting the rescue and the rest of the town is being covered by the other remaining six firefighters on duty after the  minutes on scene if the patient is transported two firefighters accompany the rescue to the hospital there is a  chance that our only ladder truck would not be able to respond to a structure fire during the  minute time period i understand this is controversial and discussing money and saving lives will spark controversy i am doctor and have worked in emergency departments since  i spent five years working in newarks busiest trauma center we were stretched for resources and made it work then and i dont see why we cant make it work now it is going to take communication collaboration and cooperation i am willing to work with everyone to make this work for the best interests of the residents of cumberland other achievements on the finance committee include meeting with the chief discussing the budget trying to find areas that could be slimmed down or eliminated also i made suggestions as to moving money we had in the bank into accounts that were gaining better interests which helped the chief truly went above and beyond working on the budget working many hours into the night with the finance director on the budget the district is currently handcuffed by the union contract that expires on june   it takes up  of the entire budget and only leaves  to run everything else to be clear i dont blame the union but rather bruce lemois who negotiated the previous contract and gave them offers they couldnt refuse this next comment has been corrected after clarification from one of the firefighters the men of the department pay their deductibles not copays and then are reimbursed by a third party vendor for up to  for a family and  for a single firefighters copays bottom line is the current contract is nonsustainable and it is up for renewal this term if bruce lemois is reelected the future is bleak and the department will likely end up in receivership which nobody wants to see happen once in receivership all the current contracts dont matter and the person assigned makes decisions regarding staffing and other administrative decisions hopefully the town will take over before anything more drastic happens because these men have spent many years as professional firefighters working in good faith and dont deserve to have the livelihoods put in jeopardy for bruce lemoiss political aspirations he recently admitted why he shouldnt be reelected when he admitted that he couldnt understand why a tax cut in  lead to deficits in  he intentionally left out the  deficit because he at least knew that was even too obvious to understand anyone who pays taxes and understands basic math can understand that lowering the tax in  led to less revenue in  which lead to a  deficit in  not that i nor anyone else wanted to raise the fire tax so dramatically but we were forced to do what our charter dictates our charter allows a  increase from the previous years tax levy which is a good thing for you the taxpayers this increase led to a carryover deficit of  in  because we were already set so far behind from the  cents per thousand bruce lemois saved you all in  which was a  tax rate increase to the town levy that  increase set the stage for years of deficit spending when responsible leaders took over and allowed the chief to budget for what the cumberland fire department needs as opposed to the reverse being told to make his budget meet this number the residents of cumberland are intelligent educated as well as informed and you already voted him out of office once so please dont make the mistake of voting for him back to cause more devastation cumberland deserves better than bruce lemois now on to some other things i have been working on for the future to help the residents of cumberland i have reached out to one our member of the general assembly to ask for a legislative grant ive been researching online for novel grants that can be awarded to independent fire districts as well as other sources of revenue i have had extensive discussions with the finance director about changing back to a once yearly payment verse our optional quarterly payment system she advised me that  of our payments come from banks andor mortgage companies who pay quarterly so they can gain interest on the money in escrow instead of the fire district we have an  milliondollar budget and having that money in the bank as soon as possible would allow the taxpayer money to gain interest which can be used to the advantage of the district as always taxpayers would still be able to call or meet with the finance director to arrange payment plans our finance director is fantastic and i have found her to be very accommodating to taxpayer requests i also discussed tiered taxing with the finance director regarding industrialcommercial and residential tax rates this is a possibility that could save residents money on the future fire taxes in the future do you know nursing homes which include short term rehab facilities are not required by law to have aeds in them neither did i until i went into one to visit a relative and was shocked it is simply incredible to think this is the law i did my research and am working with my colleagues at brown and harvard to gather our research together i am also working with a legislator who has agreed wot work with me on this issue and help get me pointed in the right direction so the law can be changed and lives can be saved in cumberland as well as the rest of the state of ri i am the physician in charge of hoperi which is a program that is federally funded and we have trained over  towncitycollegeuniversity police departments the state house and court sheriffs mall security etc in the use of narcan we recently secured  doses to distribute throughout the state of ri i lost count of the thousands of lives hoperi has saved i am also medical director in charge of a team that responds in to a natural disaster that may happen anywhere in ri resulting in large numbers of injured patients like the recent tornado in lincoln these are just a couple examples of my work behind the scenes to help people in cumberland and beyond i dont believe that members of the fire board should be paid so i donated my stipend back to the department for the last two years the way i see it the  dollars may not make a big dent in the overall budget but it will be better spent by the cumberland fire department than i,1

"continuing our discussion from last week about habits that some or many of us may have modified perhaps in some cases substantially especially since staying at home considerably more the past several months this instructive article more broadly addresses a range of lifestyle choices at the individual level which can reduce our environmental carbon footprints the most very much inline with our transition to green book club discussions in the past of sustainable energy without the hot air by the late professor david mackay this accessible guide goes through a wide gamut of actions along with their respective tons of carbon dioxide equivalent saved per year quite a few of them focus on travel and modes of travel something many of us are doing much less of these days but think of some habits that youve grown more accustomed to and may enjoy making permanent even months or years later after the covid pandemic is on the wane for instance telecommuting five daysmonth which perhaps seemed out of reach for some just a few months ago might seem easy to achieve in the future even once a certain level of travel and commuting resume and would save approximately  ton of co equivalent per year relative to a fiveday a week commuting schedule
some of you may be thinking bigger than that and if so youre in good hands with this resource have you thought about replacing a more gasguzzling vehicle with an electric vehicle that would save with a number of assumptions made about  tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year or perhaps an ev is out of reach now a more fuel efficient car or a hybrid instead would still reduce emissions substantially  or  tons of co per year respectively and a used hybrid is certainly an option for less initial outofpocket expenses and has the advantage of extending the life cycle of that vehicle
some others
 replacing  miles of driving a week with bicycling think of trying out doing some of those essential errands by bike would save  ton of co per year
 taking a bus would save a minimum of  ton of co per year again replacing a portion of driving with public transit and more if your local jurisdiction uses natural gas or even electric buses or trains and one would save even more emissions than that if the bus or train replaced car trips more frequently
 taking one fewer roundtrip crosscountry flight per year reduction of  tons of co equivalent per year
smaller actions
 turning off lights when not in a room
 decreasing trash by at least 
 turning up the thermostat in the summer less air conditioning and turning down in the winter less heat used

"a year in parliament the intention was to achieve  percent in the province of antwerp exactly one year ago impossible carl devos said on television and some cackled after him we went on and what did we do we clocked in at  percent across the province and we went from  to  elected representatives in the federal parliament from  to  elected representatives in the flemish parliament we got our first european elected representatives and another  in the walloon parliament and  in the brussels parliament bam from  to  supralocal mandate holders a year ago
today i am surrounded in parliament i am surrounded by more than a century of trade union experience that is only possible with our group with gaby colebunders former union representative of ford genk do you remember his first intervention a fiery indictment against racism when the asylum center of bilzen was set on fire by farright pyromaniacs for thirty years the miners have been asking for their pension to be rectified it is only when miner is son gaby colebunders enters parliament that things finally get going chance maybe what is certain is that gaby will sink his teeth into it until it is arranged and that the liberal ministers are crazy about colere a large lobby group of the miners that is what they call gaby and co that is a nice compliment the pvda as a more efficient megaphone of the working class
also think of maria vindevoghel for twenty years she has been cleaning the airport of brussels in the cleaning would she have known then that she is shaking up parliamentarians from the stands today about the future of the airport madam minister i have experienced it myself says maria with roberto damico after  years of night shift at caterpillar in gosselies to parliament with nadia moscufo  years of service at aldi the fiery trade union woman from liege gaby maria roberto nadia working class heroes in parliament
street council street that is our starting point we listen to what is going on in the workplace and in the neighbourhood we will bring this to parliament substantiated with proposals from our research department and staff and afterwards we bring it back to the workplace and the neighbourhood we have a wonderful team of dozens of employees who study who contact the unions or professors or civil society who are looking for testimonials who prepare the interventions in parliament who record subtitle publish the videos those who are on site do research and listen most importantly listen my deepest respect for all those teams in the federal european flemish walloon and brussels parliament and in the senate no routines no cabinet members no springboard careerists but all new people with a big social heart much respect to all those companeras y companeros and thumbs up also to raoul hedebouw pvda nadia moscufo ruben ramboer marco van hees gille feyaerts and loonis logghe who lead the entire group
best moment of the past year our emergency fund for healthcare we have worked hard for that populism the liberals and nva shouted in unison any miscreant can get any crazy proposal through parliament said servais verherstraeten cdv about our health care fund insane proposal and about me miscreant but we continued and the  million euros extra for healthcare came the telephone from a hospital in early april that the money from our fund had arrived made me shed a tear our change is working
say do you really think that all those people forgot about that right away or what when sofie merckx gets angry she speaks antwerp she has been living in charleroi for years and is a gp there for medicine for het volk perfectly bilingual such as raoul hedebouw pvda from liege and thierry warmoes from namur sofie was able to put her stamp on barely a year she has helped to ensure that patient associations have a place and an advisory voice on the pharmaceutical reimbursement committee during the corona crisis she makes the voice of medicine voor het volk heard in a debate that is colored by  different ministers of mouth masks and even more ministers responsible for public health today sophie is fighting to have covid recognized as an occupational disease an important bill that may be able to pass sophie makes no distinction brussels resident fleming or waal they all count for us that we are one national party the red devils of politics it still makes all other factions uncomfortable
we have a very diverse group there is raoul hedebouw pvda he is incomparable passionate committed strong he is the engine of the team there are the calm interventions of greet daems equally involved substantiated convincing you should do it anyway as a newcomer to that macho parliament you have the passion of nabil boukili when he defends the palestinians in the foreign policy debates and the tranquility of steven de vuyst who sits next to me in that parliament steven is alderman of the pvda in zelzate on the ghentterneuzen canal together with borgerhout this is the reddest spot in the north of the country steven is on the social affairs committee on december  he and raoul hedebouw submitted the country is first civil law act to the chamber of representatives the request to increase the minimum pension in our country to  euros net in the meantime we had collected more than  signatures with the entire party in the meantime we are five months after the submission and parliament continues to use all possible tricks to avoid discussing our proposal
we have been active in the federal parliament for a year now the classical parties accuse us of populism because we dare to propose that mps would give half a month is wages for the fight against corona this is done in dozens of countries with us all classical parties arrogantly sweep such a proposal off the table last week things were once again up in the air when we proposed to introduce a corona tax on multimillionaires to pay the bill for the crisis one economist after another in europe meanwhile is convinced that it is high time to make the very rich contribute instead of allowing wealth inequality to grow into a frenzied chasm but with us the traditional parties have become so arrogant that they dont want to see or hear real political innovation people no longer like that our proposals do according to the latest polls we would keep all our voters from last year and add another half of new voters we will see
one thing is certain we will continue you force change throughout society parliamentary work is just a megaphone of what is happening on the ground a megaphone for the working class a megaphone for honest politics a megaphone for change i promised that exactly one year ago we do our best with all our base groups with all our members and employees in the neighborhoods and in the workplace as dirk van duppen put it the pvda with extraordinary people who are ordinary and with ordinary people who are extraordinary with light workers and with shadow workers i see the world tipping i believe it will be okay",1
"on tuesday june nd we will organize our next monthly lecture the first part of our china series every month we touch upon another often hot topic with interesting speakers we have been able to welcome ministers and professors politicians and scientists and many more these lectures are often visited by both members and nonmembers as they are accessible to all however this time it will of course be a little bit different the lecture will take place on zoom
for the first part of our china series we are going to organize a lecture around the effects the covid outbreak has on international relations and more specifically china is international relations a pneumonia of unknown cause detected in wuhan china was first reported to the who in china on  december  turning china into the first epicenter of the coronavirus following the outbreak in china the coronavirus spread globally marking the start of a still ongoing global pandemic china is involvement in the early stages of the pandemic is contested with voices raising criticism that centers around the question if china could have prevented the rapid spread of the virus through more transparent communication with other states and international organizations like the who others argue that china is response to the crisis should serve as a role model for other countries currently experiencing the peak or beginning stages of the pandemic through the covid crisis the trade war between the united states and china has shifted into a war over which country handled the outbreak more adequately thus it is clear that the covid pandemic has implications for international relations and the international world order ranging from conflicted interstate relations for example between china and the united states to possible shifts in the hegemonic world order due to the developments of the pandemic
during this lecture we are going to look into the background of china is response in the early stages and later on furthermore we will take a look at what the perspectives of other countries on their approach are how effective has the chinese response to the outbreak been should we be concerned that russia and china are once again helping out italy or should we see this as a sign of goodwill and how will the covid outbreak influence china is position in the hegemonic world order and as a consequence that of the united states these more and of course your own questions will be answered during the lecture
our speakers will each give a short lecture of about  minutes afterwards there will be a qa session with the speakers during which you can ask all your pressing questions to the experts the speakers will be announced in the facebook event later
access is of course free the link to the lecture will be posted in the event later we hope to see you online on the nd",1
"risk of contagion in public toilets also by air why is it not discussed the research project of the university of foggia must be considered as soon as possible
by air for minutes in the bathrooms you can get infected by inhaling the virus why dont we talk about it
who doesnt regularly go to a public bathroom why are not we discussing specific measures
the hectic everyday life before the start of the lockdown led us to spend most of the day away from home and the use of public toilets in the office at the university at the bar rather than in the station on the train in a restaurant or at the cinema it was an almost obligatory stop then everything stopped suddenly and only now that it is gradually returning to normality great attention is paid to the use of common areas to avoid contagion opportunities but public toilets are not mentioned specific protocols and measures are not provided ad hoc yet their use will have to be revised and redesigned
we must not forget that a public bathroom due to use by several people and poor hygiene is a place full of viruses and bacteria where it is very easy to contract infections as is known from a substantial medical literature the bioaerosol that set of droplets that forms following the use of the toilet and the drain reaches the surfaces on which it is deposited but also persists in suspension for many minutes and can also be inhaled after the evaporation of the water
furthermore with the advent of the covid pandemic recent studies have highlighted how swabs carried out on surfaces such as toilets and sinks were positive after their use by infected subjects but also asymptomatic or apparently cured
rules of good personal hygiene and cleaning of common areas are to be put into practice every day but they are not enough today it is now more than ever necessary to pay attention to a radical resolution of a neglected problem
the collaboration between prof arcangelo liso from the university of foggia and prof roberto verzicco of the university of rome tor vergata made it possible to develop a system that could revolutionize the hygiene of public toilets following laboratory experiments the use of a specific foam was tested with persistence and adhesion properties capable of trapping urine droplets and avoiding the formation of bioaerosol that forms during urination and subsequent discharge this innovative product with a detergent action is biodegradable nontoxic to humans or harmful to surfaces and its constant use would reduce the need to sanitize the bathroom after each single use it would be enough to spray a layer of foam inside the toilet to completely eliminate the production of bioaerosol this project of the university of foggia as well as if there are any others can therefore represent a valid prevention tool for the spread of covid and a strategic ally in the slow return to normality let the european national and regional institutions consider all the possible solutions posed by scientific research and immediately support them there is no further time to waste in the meantime citizens should be informed including of the risk of contagion by air from the toilet and specific restrictions on access to all public toilets are set up

if there is anyone still that has a minor doubt he should remove it off his agenda it is well known now that the second outbreak of the corona virus is a matter of time this is not a prophecy of rage nor a scenario from portentous pessimists its a fact now that it is an obvious consequence of our behavior and conduct the series of facilitations that were released to press conference last saturday night is a direct result of tremendous pressure that was put upon th  e finance and economy ministry offices that were supported by business proprietors who see their businesses crushing and the land they worked hard for being eliminated in front of them the israeli population that consists of sophisticate and daring public presumed that the exit strategy plan that was released was not just in order to assist the business proprietors but also to present the overtake over the corona virus crisis which is not true as long as there is no cure and vaccine available at hand all that resulted in the utilization of the facilitations for sophistry and systematic violation of the rules because of the presumption that there is no real need in them and understanding that most are not enforceable d for jogging or other sports practice and there you hear of more and more documentation flooding social networks about violations or like we taught to name it to discount when professor barabash mentioned that until passover  people would be diagnosed with the virus he seemed delusional but when the number of infected cases was verified at last the public responded with disdain most of the infected are recovering show no symptoms there are maybe  at most that die eventually and most of them are elderly or ones whove had preexisting conditions so the high number of cases that displayed isnt relevant and say nothing but its enough just to look over at spain and france usa and great britain to understand that reality is different the israelis have grown accustomed to trusting god the institution netanyahu the professional and dedicated doctors the jewish mind in fact we have become risk managers of ourselves on the basis of all this data we have decided that we are allowed to participate in crowded demonstrations in the name of democracy to conduct secret prayer meetings in the name of religion to hold sittings with many attenders in high court of justice and celebrate holiday feasts with young family members the leadership of the ultraorthodox public did well asking to ignore the facilitations of the exit strategy plan and continue to stay at their homes the residents of bnei brak do not have the privilege to undergo another round of outbreak at their expanse once again and another round as mentioned afore is only a matter of time the original story was published in israel hayom ������������������������������ ������������������������ newspaper on april th,1
