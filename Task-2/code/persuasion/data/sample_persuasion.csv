sadly this is happening all over america today they are large organizations with several branches bearing the same corrupt fruit its a real ponzi scheme and these people who do this are engaging in criminal activity they prey on the hearts of the american people they set up campaigns telling you they have lawyers and groups who can help the voiceless all lies
many of these organizations are in fact up on the hill claiming to lobby against this when in reality they are perpetuating the problem they are actually behind the greedy evil schemes of abuse disease and the death of life in fact in some ofthe worst cases less than a penny of every dollar that is donated is ever given to the voiceless victim or to even stop the cycle
right now there are thousands and thousands of nonprofits and charities in the united states these corrupt trees bearing rotten fruit are destroying the integrity of america and the moral obligation to do what is right
let us look at the wild horse and burro situation
many large and small nonprofits are perpetuating the path of pesticides abuse and death alongside the bureau of land management conspiracy to defraud the united states of america

everything is not as it seems 
these claimed advocacy groups share the pain and the horror all over social media with a donate button you then cry and feel heartbroken by the sadness the pain and the death the animals face and rightfully so but understand this the predator knows this they know you will pull out your wallet and give your money to them yet nothing changes the cycle of abuse and pain continues today in fact it is worse
look at all the years of this happening and look at the cycle continue and now many nonprofits are millionaires and the animals die contracts awarded to poison them with epa labeled pesticides awarded money to adopt sanctuary schemes kill pen cycle schemes slaughter pipeline trafficking death etc
if you truly care please stop giving to the nonprofits they are a chain of disgrace and they perpetuate the cycle of death"
