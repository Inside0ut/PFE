1,"a year ago today it was confirmed that the liberal democrats had won control of the new somerset west  taunton council
this came after the merger of the two previous conservativeled councils taunton deane borough council and west somerset council
we won 3059 seats two subsequent byelections later saw us increase our majority to 32
the beginning was rocky as we found a new council struggling to cope weve spent a lot of the first year steadying the boat but this hasnt stopped us from making many positive steps from starting the coal orchard regeneration in taunton to building a new industry site in minehead for a local employer whilst having to deal with other immediate matters from repairing the stormdamaged sea wall at watchet to continuing to invest in staff to improve the services we provide
unfortunately the current crisis has obviously changed our priorities for a while but we are still trying to keep other exciting projects on track from finally commencing the construction of the firepool redevelopment in taunton this year to other projects such as supporting the progress of a new train station in wellington or the construction and purchasing of new council homes in the district
it is often been tough but we are proud of what we have achieved so far and will achieve much more whilst maintaining the importance of the climate emergency
here is a list of a number of our achievements from february  wwwtdldcouknewsstories2020225swtsfirstbudget

1,"merkel is dictation
democracy is closed
what is going on in germany the chancellor refuses to discuss this at state level she is not in the mood for discussions you say snotty
the chancellor is activities are drifting more and more into a dictate of omnipotence and its specifications this behavior is not worthy of the office because it is more reminiscent of the sandbox games of a fiveyearold or just the role models from the old days of the gdr the chancellor orders the federal states to more or less follow their draft resolutions demands a uniform approach and action under her direction although there are very large regional differences and needs
what do we have in germany now monarchy dictatorship no we elected this sed miracle girl from the past to the highest office in the republic queen merkel has ruled over the obedient majority for almost years and is well on her way to hypnotically throwing everyone under the plates
the real question is when is enough
we are kept in check for weeks with false reports from the virologist droste schools are closed childcare services withdrawn although the results have been different for weeks
accusesvirologistsoffalsestudyontheviralloadofchildren
they decided to stigmatize us by considering the necessary acceptance for dictatorial features as meaningful it has come to this in this country democracy is only on the packaging the pandemic has paved the way to omnipotence
the regulatory authorities are used against us for the purpose of complying with and implementing alleged protective measures although we are systemically and regionally completely different from italy spain france and belgium not to mention the broken savings and nonexistent social systems like in the usa russia and china the only thing that can be recognized equally is the behavior of the government towards omnipotence and oppression
this government does not deserve a vote this government especially ms merkel acts dictatorially and beyond moral responsibility when faced with emergencies far greater collateral damage is produced than how protection is exercised on the citizen one likes to cite the example of italyalthough it lacks any systemic basis
this is no longer the country it was in like where you could still feel the cohesion and the cornerstones of democracy
the country will never forget the lockdown and may never leave again

the main purpose of a climate project is to ensure that greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere are reduced there are different ways to do this and the market is constantly evolving with new projects and increasingly better methods for measuring emission reductions
one way that is easy to measure and easy to understand is therefore projects that produce renewable energy by creating the kind of energy that does not cause emissions we give people the opportunity to stop using fossil fuels for example when we build wind power in india and connect more people to the electricity grid they no longer need to use diesel generators or fire with coal which is often the case before the project is implemented

1,"below is one of the questions in the rome newstribune is recent qa with the candidates for sheriff and i want to expand on my response since we were limited to words
the reason being is that mental health and the lack of resources for those who need help is one of the biggest issues currently facing law enforcement that is because people in a mental health crisis are unfortunately more likely to encounter police and often end up in jail than to get medical assistance
q the jail medical facility is undergoing a major expansion to include a mental health wing how do you envision using it
a this splostfunded expansion is a step in the right direction to providing a safer environment for inmates and employees since the closing of northwest regional our jail has been flooded with people with mental illnesses and no access to resources we have been ill equipped to handle it we currently have four medical beds insufficient to say the least the new unit will bring that number closer to new treatment programs will also be part of the expansion i thank the citizens of floyd county for recognizing this major need and voting yes to the splost
i am also focused on promoting training i was one of the first in our agency and our area to seek out cit training and am also a certified crisis intervention instructor our deputies need this training to do their jobs effectively in fact i would love to see all local law enforcement agencies get more training in this area
i also want to point out that with such a major decline in the number of mental health facilities services and funding in our state over the years we are fortunate to have an organization like nami rome ga here to provide support education and advocacy other organizations doing great things to support people coping with a mental illness include elevation house livingproof recovery and nextdoor at livingproof recovery should i be elected i would look forward to collaborating with these organizations and others to find better solutions to this issue in our community
i hope that by creating a safer environment adding training for our staff and partnering with community organizations we can help some of these people with mental illnesses get on a healthier path instead of jail being a revolving door

1,a genuine disciple february a highschool friend was torn between his familys religious beliefs his dad had been an avowed atheist since college yet his mom lived a devoted christian life he settled on calling himself an agnostic this classmate became a respected medical doctor even though he still professed he was an agnostic he told me he decided to attend church because it was good for his public image sad but jesus encountered those with this dishonest way of life nineteen times he called people hypocrites describing nonbelievers pretending they were righteous and holy to be seen by men but they do all their deeds to be noticed by men matt in particular he condemned the pharisees and scribes for being hypocrites they blew trumpets in the synagogues and streets to call attention to their acts of generosity they prayed in public places so that people could see them and put on gloomy faces when they fasted so others would notice almost none of them accepted jesus as the messiah the barna group conducted an extensive research project asking nonchristians why they rejected christianity responded that it was because the church was full of hypocrites several issues exist with this as an excuse first people who use this pretext dont know the biblical meaning of the term hypocrite they dont understand what the church is about or comprehend the distinction between a hypocrite and a genuine disciple the contemporary definition of a hypocrite and the biblical meaning arent the same skeptics try to impose twentyfirst century definitions on words in the bible the simplest biblical interpretation of hypocrisy is a religious performance to impress people it is a nonbeliever pretending to live a virtuous and moral life in public without a change of their heart becoming a genuine disciple begins in the heart these people honor me with their lips but their hearts are far from me mat niv when we accept christ as our savior we are born again and he gives us a new spiritual heart if anyone is in christ he is a new creature the old things passed away behold new things have come co jesus enrolls us in his school of discipleship which means we become learners and will learn for the rest of lives graduation takes place in the final phase of salvation we call glorification then our perfecting will be complete the dead will be raised imperishable and we will be changed co my students in bible college sought to make perfect grades but often failed to reach their goal that didnt disqualify them as students they kept trying bornagain believers are disciples striving for perfection we dont consistently reach that goal john gave the process to follow after we fail if we confess our sins he is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness jn it doesnt say confess our sins then chastise ourselves for several weeks attempting to add to jesus finished work no after we confess our sin and he forgives us we are to get up and continue striving for christlikeness that does not make the individual a hypocrite when he or she accepts gods forgiveness and keeps going a hypocrite is not a person who commits sin on occasions but they practice sins on a routine basis and continue pretending they are perfect a hypocrite has a terminal heart condition that requires a heart transplant a genuine disciple who has a new heart may have a hour bug but takes his medicine ie repentance and will try again tomorrow the church is supposed to be a hospital for spiritually sick people not a gallery of perfect men and women those that use the excuse the church is filled with hypocrites must never go to the doctor or hospital because it is full of sick people the church is a gathering of imperfect disciples seeking to become more perfect in their walk with christ by learning encouraging each other and worshipping god who has accepted them those who accuse true disciples with hypocrisy are the real hypocrites they try to deflect attention from their own brokenness by pointing out a genuine disciples failure not understanding god has forgiven the disciples failure note other characteristics a hypocrite is more concerned with correcting others than themselves they are judgmental jesus is referring to hypocrites when teaching about judging others why do you look at the speck that is in your brother is eye but do not notice the log that is in your own eye you hypocrite first take the log out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother is eye mat a hypocrite overlooks all the righteous acts the person they are condemning has done they should consider peter who failed by cursing and vowing three times he did not know jesus yet fifty days later god anointed him to preach and came to christ are there hypocrites in the church yes but the majority are genuine disciples most hypocrites are outside looking in sustaining word for the week have you received christ and become a genuine disciple if you have been accused of being a hypocrite rest in christs finished work and keep going

fast forward to today and it is easy to see why the democrats have forsaken the idea of being the champion of the working man they truly believe that our country is being destroyed by capitalism the economic system upon which our great nation was built and that socialism will end that destruction
just listen to all of the democrat politicians and their class warfare campaigns capitalism is touted as a system of the haves and have nots and the only way for everyone to have an equitable chance is to have the government provide for all of your basic needs translation bureaucrats and politicians will do a better job of taking care of you than you can for yourself

1,business tax ballot measures this elections two sides of the progressive coin heads the very hopeful story of proposition c universal childcare in san francisco tails the sad story of proposition d affordable housing for all despite a million yes on d campaign on election day prop d went down in humiliating to defeat not even winning a simple majority let alone its necessary vote but proposition c has won a close vote victory to disclosure todco strongly endorsed and provided in support to the proposition c universal childcare in san francisco campaign the setup proposition d was put on the june ballot on january th by five members of the board of supervisors it proposed to impose a new gross receipts tax of on revenues a business receives from leasing some commercial spaces in san francisco to fund homeless services housing for extremely lowtomiddleincome households and for other public purposes the city controller estimated it would generate approximately million per year for such programs because it was placed on the ballot by the supervisors due to proposition rules proposition d required approval by of city voters to go into effect the backstory is that proposition d was quickly drafted and brought forward in the weeks following mayor ed lees sudden death with the cooperation of the staff of the new acting mayor there had been no discussion at all of such a housingfunding june ballot measure before this and prop d featured prominently as one plank in the campaign of one candidate for mayor in the june election who was endorsed by all its sponsors the second factor in this election scenario was the competing proposition c ballot universal childcare measure that would increase the same city business taxes at a higher rate to fund quality early care and education for young children and for other public purposes the city controller estimated it would generate approximately million per year for such programs this ballot measure had been developed and drafted in the second half of by a broad citywide coalition of childcare service providers and advocacy groups it was put on the ballot by it proponents collecting registered voter signatures which also means that it potentially required only a simple majority of voter approval to go into effect this legal issue has not yet been finally resolved by the state supreme court because they both proposed to increase the same tax whichever one of these measures secured the most votes provided that prop d got its required vote to start with would be the one that went into effect the other would be void prop c featured prominently as one plank in the campaign of another candidate for mayor in the june election who had worked closely with this community coalition from the start plainly both measures proposed a very progressive funding source increased city businesses taxes to achieve vital community and civic goals more affordable housing or greatly expanded affordable childcare that would directly benefit lowerandmiddleincome san francisco households but only one could win at best and both were part of the mayors race too prop d very intentionally so the community conflict children vs housing was an instant wedge issue for the citys politically active progressive community constituencies prop c advocates were understandably unhappy even angered about the sudden appearance of a competing ballot measure at the last minute that was so clearly connected to the unexpected june mayors race this included a wide range of community organizations across the city of many types engaged or concerned with family and education services other activists felt that the longtime affordable housing issue a mainstay of san francisco progressive politics and a generally popular political cause was being opportunistically rippedoff for other transparent political purposes prop ds community advocates did not directly address these reactions publicly core support came from several but not all of the citys nonprofit affordable housing developers and their networks that stood to gain directly from prop d new funding this included the megascale multistate nonprofits like mercy housing and bridge housing local communitybased groups like chinatown cdc tenderloin ndc and mission housing development corp and their forprofit construction and management companies like nibbi bros and the john stewart co in private some prop d advocates offered a realpolitik assurance dont worry prop d cant get a vote anyway so it wont ever block prop c and all prop c needs is to pass as a compromise a number of groups endorsed both measures despite the selfevident logical inconsistency of this position the overall outcome of these community dynamics was a significant estrangement among the two measures supporters prop ds campaign received little community support outside the networks of its core beneficiaries and political sponsors prop c had a significantly broader community base thanks to its inclusive communitydriven development and initiation downtown opposition to props c and d there was no division among the citys business constituencies business tax increases are bad vote no on both c and d lead by sf boma the building owners and managers association and with the financial support of the chamber of commerces san francisco forward pac various business associations and dozens of downtown property owners the committee for an affordable san francisco no on propositions c and d has so far spent at least to defeat both measures this mainly funded mailers and many tv ads prop c alone was especially targeted due to its greater likelihood of passing with just a vote the oppositions general theme acknowledged the worthiness of affordable housing and childcare but objected to taxing business interests alone for this as unfair andor economically counterproductive predictably the san francisco chronicle and business times both supported this view few if any community groups formally opposed either prop c or prop d political endorsements followed the political alliances of each measures sponsors on the board of supervisors the yes on prop c campaign prop cs supporters raised at least for the yes on c campaign funding some mailers and extensive social media ads in addition to todco the principal funders included the seiu the campaign also coordinated to a degree with other progressive ballot measure campaigns like yes on f the campaigns general theme emphasized the three components of the measure immediate lowincome child care center waiting list slots for children future middleincome family subsidies and increased wages for child careeducation workers the yes on prop d campaign prop ds supporters raised over for the yes on d campaign how it was used is not evident the campaigns general theme focused on the crucial need for affordable housing and homeless housing in san francisco the principle funders include two longtime political establishment pacs the committee on jobs and progress san francisco as well as many politicallyconnected developers interestingly kaiser permanent contributed presumably as part of its new regional affordable housing program even facebook corp chipped in several nonprofit housing developers added a total of and the sf police officers association added the voters judgment on june th election day downtowns sophisticated and wellfunded no and c and d campaign was certainly very effective proposition d was absolutely crushed failing to achieve even a simple majority vote and with just approval against a no vote short of its required approval vote after a weeks counting of late ballots proposition c has won by about votes lessons to learn this hard way a divided community cant beat downtown because they were in direct competition with each other neither prop c nor prop d had universal community support if the community resources that were devoted to prop d had instead been combined in support of broadbased prop c then prop c would have won by a substantial margin despite the onslaught of downtown s against it but the topdown last minute prop d never stood a chance it can take a mayors committed leadership to win revenue ballot measures especially votes simply appealing to holy issues like affordablehomeless housing or child careeducation is not enough no bond or special tax measure needing voter approval has ever passed without strong political support from the mayors office as interim mayor mark farrell had no real political capital to give prop d and mayoral support dramatically increases the chances for majorityapproval tax measures if the state supreme court rules this is a valid option for future voterinitiative tax measures this will be a crucial leadership opportunity for the citys new mayor prop ds community supporters were played for fools given these two hard allthetime realities there was never any realistic hope at all of getting a vote for prop d in the current circumstances especially while having a divisive mayors race at the same time too the cynical political strategy of at least some of prop ds initiators to use it as a wedge issue to divide progressive community resources and thereby defeat the very from their point of view politically dangerous likelytowin prop c may well have worked and prop ds community supporters have nothing positive to take from their humiliating showing and wasted resources their willingness to fall for this sucker bait was astonishing in its naivet and the broken community trusts it leaves behind may prove hard to heal downtown can be beat prop cs victory without mayoral and establishment support and against strong opposition shows the path to winning progressive ballot measures even sizeable new downtown taxes it appealed not to just the left but to all san francisco constituencies concerned with the future of children and families in the city it proposed to financially assist not just lowerincome households but middleincome families too and it mobilized a diverse community network that does not usually engage in electoral contests the citys child care and educational providers and their many members this is an important victory john elberling president todco group

1,chapter from savage the man across the alley scanned the streets waiting and watching that he was a spy for grundal was common knowledge and not a particularly good one at that but it meant that grundal was looking for her not a good scenario grundal had far more competent and dangerous men working for him shed have to be careful and get him some money soon lifting her hood over her head kyra let her shoulders sink and her head drop towards the ground she slowly shuffled out onto the street walking straight pass the spy as she stepped towards him she turned and coughed then spoke in a gravely voice spare a coin for a starving grandmother the spy is brow furrowed as he looked pass her trying to make sure his intended target wasnt in the busy crowded street get lost you old goat im busy well i never kyra huffed and then shuffled her way around the corner she kept up her old lady guise for the rest of her walk there was no telling who else was out there watching when she finally reached her destination kyra opened the shop door taking a quick look at everyone in the room she didnt see anyone out of place good grundal didnt know to look for her here she lifted her hood and stood up straight once again looking like a vibrant young woman instead of a hunched back granny the pleasant aroma of fresh baked sweets and exotic teas filled her nose her mouth watered reflexively as she identified the scent of cinnamon tarka cake the sweet and savory treat was her favorite and was her second favorite reason to visit the bacco hoggard is bacco was a simple affair a few tables spread out to offer maximum privacy and the main counter where his treats were displayed kyra walked up to the counter and grabbed the piece of tarka cake that hoggard had waiting for her the soft and sweet cake melted in her mouth kyra slowly savored the treat before turning her attention to the waiting bacco owner do you have the merchandise asked hoggard kyra glanced down the counter no one was within hearing distance hoggard was confident that none of his patrons were spies or the sort to sell him out but kyra wasnt willing to trust that easily she only trusted a few people and none of them were here she slid a leather pouch across the counter release papers signed by the duke not authentic but only the duke himself would know the difference hoggard slid the pouch under the counter opened it and quickly inspected the forged document you truly have a gift kyra kyra smiled it was true she had a gift anything she saw she remembered and was able to replicate a signature a painting she could even duplicate a statue if necessary but she didnt like working with clay too time consuming and messy besides the real money was in forged documents she hardly ever got requests to do artwork thank you hoggard have you anything else you need im a little light on the cash this month grundal and his goons are looking for me normally this wouldnt be an issue but her last few bets had been fairly large too large considering the outcome and grundal sent the more dangerous goons out when the money got big hoggard shook his head youd be a rich woman if youd simply quit gambling havent i told you grundal is races are fixed kyra shrugged i had a cant miss tip i thought id beat grundal at his own game hoggard scoffed grundal likes to do that he has one of his lowlevel grunts make the rounds hinting that the fix is in but for the right price hell cough up the secret sound familiar too familiar okay hoggie i vow to never gamble with grundal again now can you help me or what hoggard wasnt just kyra is preferred middle man he was a fatherly figure that treated her with respect and over the years their comfort level with each other had grown to the point where teasing and nicknames were common the age difference was enough to remove any sexual issues she was just into her twenties while hoggard was at least double that kyra didnt have any daddy issues and hoggard had never acted inappropriate towards her not that she entirely trusted him he was after all a man and men by nature were not trust worthy hoggard stared at her for a moment as if he was debating something he then sighed perhaps but im not sure this job is a fit for you i do not think it requires any forging it is more a mystery job kyra was intrigued a mystery was right up her alley hoggie my dear do not tease me you know i love a riddle what kind of mystery cant i solve im not saying youre not smart enough im saying you probably want to avoid this job it could be dangerous in a way youve never dealt with before what could be more dangerous than stealing orders from a military camp you had no problem sending me on that job i have faith that you can sneak into any place and i know once you look at something you can replicate it perfectly this is not about your skills as a thief or your smarts come to the back and ill explain kyra was really curious now rarely did hoggard feel the need to leave the bar to discuss a job normally if he was comfortable with the crowd he simply talked in low tones there must be something special about this job for him to be so secretive thought kyra hoggard sat at his desk and waved at the open chair across from him kyra sat down and waited for an explanation hoggard said nothing are you going to tell me or are we just going to sit here and meditate asked kyra shush child im deciding whether or not to tell you hoggard paused damn it i never shouldve mentioned it i know youll just pester me until i tell you kyra gave a sly grin it was true she could be very persistent or annoying depending on who is point of view one was getting here is the job a client has an enemy who has been sabotaging his business interests and killing his allies he is had no luck finding out who is behind the attacks with the normal methods it is likely that some on the city guard are on the payroll of whoever is behind these attacks he needs to find out who it is kyra frowned her brow furrowed as she pondered the problem this doesnt sound like a job for a thief or a forgery artist nor does it sound incredibly dangerous i mean sure it is dangerous killers and all that but ive dealt with dangerous men before what makes this job any more dangerous than those ones what are not you telling me it is more dangerous because of what i havent told you the client is prince valentine astor suddenly she understood prince valentine son of tristan astor ruler of draisha was the future king of draisha if he had an enemy powerful enough to take on the prince whoever was sent to find out the secret would be dealing with a highly motivated killer who would not want someone snooping around it also explained why it was strange that the normal methods hadnt worked prince astor had access to the city guards the royal palace guards and unlimited funds to hire investigators mercenaries or sellswords to find the information he was seeking that prince astor would come to hoggard with the job meant everyone else had failed how many people has the prince hired so far three that i know of admitted hoggard he has put enormous pressure on the city guards as well but they seem incapable of making any progress the city guard was corrupt everyone in draisha knew that however if the prince couldnt get info out of them then no one could his pockets were deep in coin and influence everything a corrupt city official desired how many of the men he hired are still alive hoggard scratched his chin nervously one well possibly one two were found in alleys with their throats cut the third is missing all were exsoldiers very capable warriors with experience in such matters if the sellswords who specialize in such work are getting killed why did the prince come to you you are not the one people come to for thugs or mercenaries you are the one they come to when they need to obtain things i said the same thing to the prince he said he wanted someone with a different approach to tackle his problem he wants someone who thinks outside the box someone with unorthodox methods who can hopefully find out the information he needs without dying first i told the prince i only know one person smart enough and crazy enough to take the job and what did lanister say when you offered him the job asked kyra jokingly ha lanister is certainly crazy enough to do it just show him enough coin and hed do just about anything no kyra you are the only one crazy enough and smart enough to figure this little mystery out but how to do it without getting your throat cut is what concerns me trust me hoggie im too fond of my neck to let it be slit but i will take the job under certain conditions kyra couldnt resist the challenge and the opportunity to establish a working relationship with a prince was a very special opportunity but she was no fool either if she did this job it would have to be done right and that meant bringing in protection protection she could fully trust im listening im going to have to hire some muscle for this job and it would not come cheap i get coin for that upfront i will also require triple my normal fee the prince was rich kyra figured he wouldnt balk at such a price done and done actually i already negotiated a price for you far above what you are asking figure this out for the prince and you can easily wipe out your gambling debts and then some do you want me to arrange the muscle i know a few sellswords who might be up to the task kyra shook her head no the type of men you could hire are not what i need i need someone that is not from draisha i need someone who scares the type of men you know hoggard is brow furrowed as he considered her words suddenly he sat up straight in his chair and pointed his finger at her accusingly kyra no you cant be serious this is not protecting a caravan or rescuing a hostage from bandits you cant bring that savage into draisha said hoggard in protest kyra grinned shed known what her friend was going to say before the words ever left his mouth however despite his reputation kyra knew enough about the man in question to know he was someone she could trust to never betray her that was something no amount of money could buy from a normal sellsword the question wasnt if he was trust worthy the question was would she be able to convince him to take the job but that wasnt something she would share with hoggard he may be a savage but i trust him maybe a savage is just what we need to get this job done besides he can be civilized when necessary hoggard groaned bazur has destroyed the bar in pera more times than i can count i am tempted to sell that damn place just so i do not have to deal with him kyra laughed you old liar you like having a bar in the badlands it gives you access to all sorts of shifty characters you cant find in draisha besides if you didnt want your bar destroyed why did you put a bounty up in your bar for the first man to beat bazur up because that bounty has made me triple the coin from fools going out there to try their hands at beating up the halforc most of the time the fools just sit around drinking waiting for the opportunity to fight him but most never get the opportunity as he visits so rarely but i spend half my winnings fixing the place after bazur is done destroying it my math says you are still making a healthy profit off of him that is true conceded hoggard i would make a lot more but he barely ever visits pera and when he does he only stays long enough to trade have a few drinks and take on whichever challenger is waiting for him if hed be more reasonable i would make a fortune off him kyra shook her head bazur was rough and tough and enjoyed fighting but he had a particular code of honor he wouldnt become hoggard is prize fighter or for anyone else he was too independent for that youll never get him to agree to being your fighter just be happy he likes your bar it is the honey mead orcs drink mead orcs and elves love the stuff thank goodness the bartender keeps bees getting the really good stuff in from irri is challenging hoggard pulled a purse out of his desk and threw it to kyra the prince wants you to start right away there is more than enough coin to hire bazur have you taken your cut yet asked kyra as she jiggled the purse it was heavy with coin no im not taking a cut on this job kyra raised an eyebrow that was very unlike hoggard do not give me that look the prince is going to be king one day and he will owe me a favor that is worth far more than ten percent of your earnings kyra smiled she could only imagine what kind of crooked deal hoggard was cooking up that required a favor from a king true enough arrange a meeting with the prince im going to need more details if i am going to sort this out good luck kyra do not get yourself killed and for love of the gods do not let bazur destroy the city kyra shrugged as she lifted her hood over her head and resumed her disguise as an old woman i make no promises she said in her fake granny voice behind her she could hear hoggard groaning and cursing her name as she walked out the door

1,why oklahoma should vote no on sq on november i have been seeing so much somewhat misleading and deceptive attractive advertising trying to get those viewing the ads to vote yes on sq it appears that they are relying on the fact that most voters do not actually read the words of a state question until they actually see their ballot when voting and will decide based on just what they had heard advertised as opposed to understanding the real meaning of what they are voting on almost everyone would like more free choices and affordability on anything which is what these ads focus on however that is not really what sq is about below is the actual wording of sq as it will appear on the ballot the key important words toward which everyone should focus are presented below in capital letters after the sq text below i am presenting some comments about the wording and it is actual meaning for everyone to consider state question reads this measure adds a new section to article of the oklahoma constitution under the new section no law shall infringe on optometrists or opticians ability to practice within a retail mercantile establishment discriminate against optometrists or opticians based on the location of their practice or require external entrances for optometric offices within retail mercantile establishments no law shall infringe on retail mercantile establishments ability to sell prescription optical goods or services the section allows the legislature to restrict optometrists from performing surgeries within retail mercantile establishments limit the number of locations at which an optometrist may practice maintain optometric licensing requirements require optometric offices to be in a separate room of a retail mercantile establishment and impose health and safety standards it does not prohibit optometrists and opticians from agreeing with retail mercantile establishments to limit their practice laws conflicting with this section are void the section defines laws optometrist optician optical goods and services and retail mercantile establishment shall the proposal be approved for the proposal yes against the proposal no comments the only reason that sq was written in this way and will be on the ballot is because of an initiative petition on which walmart was able to get enough signatures from their many customers in their many stores throughout oklahoma by just telling them that signing it would get past the politics of eyecare and make eye exams and eyeglasses cheaper most people likely signed with just that information without really knowing and understanding the real impact of sq by the way walmart is behind the vote yes ads even though they usually do not say so in the ads this would be changing the oklahoma constitution rather that making or altering legislated law so that it can not be ever changed or amended by the oklahoma legislature in the future without another statewide vote things in the constitution trump all laws or rules by oklahoma is legislature or any heath profession boards that monitor standards of practice and care of provided by state doctors to protect the public from unethical and potentially harmful modes of practice oklahoma is the first state where walmart is attempting to totally bypass going through the elected state legislature to change or negate our laws that do not fit into their business model or positively affect their ability to profit off the healthcare sector of the economy notice how it states that no law shall infringe on the ability of an optometrist or optician to practice in a retail establishment or infringe on a retail establishment is ability to sell prescription optical goods and services in other words all of the current state public protection laws that require minimum levels of competency examination accuracy of prescription eyewear etc would be voided and not applicable to optometrists opticians or optical goods provided within a retail mercantile establishment such as walmart the laws would all still be applicable to every other professional optometrist optician and all optical goods outside of retail mercantile stores it sure appears that this is an attempt to protect the retail mercantile establishments from having to worry about maintaining a certain level of expertise and quality of care to avoid potential litigation since this is a vote to change the oklahoma constitution the state legislature would no longer have the constitutional authority to vote on change pass and enforce future laws or rules that would apply to the quality or scope of vision eyecare or optical good quality provided by any retail mercantile establishment in oklahoma other than in the specific areas stated above in sq that it allows the legislature to do it does not prohibit optometrists from agreeing with the retail establishment to limit their scope of practice there are certain minimum procedures in current oklahoma law that are required to be a part of every eye examination that often detect many other serious health problems including but not limited to glaucoma macular degeneration cancer diabetes tumors etc with this wording those laws would not apply to the optometrists in the retail mercantile stores such as walmart laws conflicting with this section are void pretty much covers it all to protect walmart and other retail establishments from having adhere to any of the laws that were passed after much debate within the oklahoma legislature over the last century those laws and regulations have served oklahomans very well as we are currently at the top of the list of states in the country when looking at the quality of vision care eye health care and optical goods provided that will rapidly change if sq passes please think about it all and hopefully you will decide to vote no on sq on november personal note thank you for reading all of this as many of you know this is my th year of practice so i am very well established and the outcome of this vote will really not personally have a significant economic affect on my practice at this point in my life my deep concern and time doing this is from the heart for my love of oklahoma and my chosen profession my sincere concern is for the very dedicated young professional doctors and future oklahomans that the high standards of care we have seen in the past will continue to be provided and available to all future oklahomans for many years to come donald j farris od please share this information with to your friends family and coworkers

1,animal rights and animal welfare know the difference there is a big difference between animal rights and animal welfare and it needs to be clarified the american veterinary medical association has taken a formal position defining the difference between the two labels animal rights vs animal welfare in their detailed policy on animal welfare and animal rights they state that they cannot endorse the views of animal rights groups here is a quote from their policy animal rights is a philosophical view and personal value characterized by statements by various animal rights groups animal welfare and animal rights are not synonymous terms the avma wholeheartedly endorses and adopts promotion of animal welfare as official policy however the avma cannot endorse the philosophical views and personal values of animal rights advocates when they are incompatible with the responsible use of animals for human purposes such as food fiber and research conducted for the benefit of both humans and animals let is take a closer look at the fundamental differences between animal welfare and the animal rights philosophy animal welfare animal welfare includes all animals whether used for food companionship or sport it is based on a principle of ownership of animals it reflects a common sense approach that animals should be treated well and that animal cruelty is wrong animal welfare standards and guidelines for animal use and management are based on sound veterinary and animal husbandry experience research and practices the avma views animal welfare as a human responsibility that encompasses all aspects of animal wellbeing including proper housing management nutrition disease prevention and treatment responsible care humane handling and when necessary humane euthanasia it also means animals that provide for human needs experience no unnecessary suffering animal rights animal rights advocates and their groups believe in the ideology that there is no distinction between animals and humans they view animal ownership as exploitation and slavery the true goal of animal rights groups is to work for legislation and humane care only until all animals are no longer owned or utilized by human beings the ncraoa north carolina responsible animal owners alliance has described what animal rights groups are all about and their activities animal rights groups exploit our love of animals to work for various types of restrictive legislation limit laws breed specific legislation mandatory spayneuter as well as laws that are steps toward changing the legal status of animals as property and the animal rights movement is about control not animal welfare supporting legislation based on emotion and philosophical interpretation provides a platform in our legal system for incremental increases toward animal status changes lately we have been accused of being against the proper care and husbandry of animals this has happened because over the years we have been working hard to shed light on extremist animal rights groups we have exposed their activities and their agenda they are afraid the public will finally realize they are staging a dramatic impact on the rights and way of life of all americans since they are feeling threatened and are afraid of exposure they have fought back against us they have called us the bad guy and much worse while doing this they have conveniently blurred the definition of animal rights which both confuses and misleads the public they accuse us of being antianimal and against animals we have even been accused of hating horses and benefiting from killing them these accusations are not even close to the truth they are outright fabrications folks who are affiliated and work with protect the harvest have pets and a number also have horses and livestock we care about animals we care about their health and wellbeing we practice and support animal welfare while these outright falsehoods that have been launched against us create more work and some challenges for us it also shows that we are making progress in short we support animal welfare but we are against animal rights taking a stand against animal rights in no way means that we do not care about animals or their welfare we do care or we would not be investing time money and a whole lot of effort in educating the public about protecting our rights animal ownership agriculture and our heritage to stay informed sign up for our newsletter httpprotecttheharvestcomnewslettersignup

1,there is still a lot to talk about and uncover and discuss and explore and many more questions to be asked of several people regarding the adam donaghey and cinestate story and ongoing situationalright this is a long one but i am fucking mad people im not even gonna post the article but leave it to the dallas morning news to print a bunch of erroneous horseshit about cinestate that paints dallas sonnier in a favorable light there are so many facts omitted and overlooked in the article and even worse so many obvious outright lies from sonnier lies that the minimal amount of journalistic digging could have easily uncovered sonnier claims adam was never an actual employee of cinestate only a contract line producer bullshit here is the call sheet from til death that lists him as an executive producer dallas also tells the journalist he accepted adam is resignation from future projects how do you fucking resign from a picturetopicture contract gig the journalist claims that all of the daily beast is sources were anonymous and he couldnt find anyone to speak on record aside from john wildman who is only associated to any of this by living in the same city and working in the same industry i love you john but you are a peripheral source at most in this regard bullshit my name is mentioned in that article and so is jeff walker is and guess what neither of us were contacted by this journalist michael granberry we were contacted by another dmn journalist a few weeks ago though so we were in their contacts they knew of us he just chose not to speak with us this allfemale led safety task force sonnier likes to tout every chance he can he says he has no involvement in it but they neglect to mention that the head of the task force is amanda presmyk his cinestate vp who shares an equal burden of accusation and guilt as sonnier im sure the majority of the people involved in the task force have good intentions but it is nothing but a pr smokescreen it is trump clutching a bible in front of a church you do not hire someone with a known history of eating dogs to pet sit while youre on vacation right you do not put a mass shooter in charge of gun control reform do you as histrionic as those comparisons sound i cannot fathom the absurdity of allowing a person directly responsible for ignoring and creating unsafe conditions to take the reigns of creating safety protocols especially someone who is so incapable of expressing any remorse for her behavior that she has to plagiarize someone else is words to do so in an internal email amanda sent out to the other members of the task force she ripped an entire verbatim paragraph out of lisa normand is recent fb post to claim how much she regrets her actions this is not only disgusting for the fact that amanda used these words as an attempt to maintain trust from the other women on the task force but insidiously so because she stole lisa is account of dealing with her own harassers and framed it as a way to excuse her behavior in not protecting other women from harassers this is the paragraph from lisa and the excerpt from amanda is email is one of the photos posted below ive been trained my whole life that it is my job to diffuse the situation to manage the male ego to cope with my negative feelings about being harassed and just push through and pretend like it didnt happen because there is work to do on top of all of this sonnier is still lying about his knowledge of adam is history of harassment he is trying to manipulate the facts by putting the focus on the timeline emphasizing that adam harassed cristen before sonnier even moved back to texas and he was therefore unaware of it bullshit it was brought to his attention as early as 2017 and he continued to hire adam as line producer and fucking fulltime employee for at least 6 other movies over the course of the following three years another aspect this article glides over because it confuses the narrative of sonnier is supposed ignorance and innocence is that dallas claims he made adam apologize to cristen number one this never happened cristen has documentation of adam is apologies and the dates do not line up in a way that backs up sonnier is claim number two how can you make adam apologize for something for you had no knowledge of pick a lane you lying shitbag the journalist spoke at length with cristen regarding this and it is nowhere to be found in the article when i first shared my account of amanda is knowledge regarding adam i sincerely hoped that she and sonnier could actually prove themselves to be capable of accepting accountability for their failings and make genuine changes for the better but in the past few weeks they have only doubled down on their lies their victim blaming their finger pointing their self pity and their desperate asscovering and i have reached a point where i do not believe they are capable of changing they prove themselves time and time again to only care about themselves they do not feel any regrets or care about the people theyve hurt they just want people to stop being mad at them so they can go back to doing the exact same shit theyve always done and this dmn article at best is lazy journalism and at worst a foul intentioned puff piece that aims to assist them in sweeping all of these steaming piles of bullshit under the rug cinestate is a toxic fucking company and both sonnier and amanda continually reveal themselves to be a pair of machiavellian sociopaths where i once hoped they could change i now hope they fucking fail and shutter because the world doesnt need any more fucking people like them in charge of anyone is wellbeing or safety

1,to those still supporting the president someone posted this on our page and i believe it is worth sharing with you how incredibly biased your company is i hope your conservative customers take a hard look at what you are really selling you certainly do not want america to be great again i am a proud republican conservative and think our great president is making america great again first off let me say thanks for writing to you and every other writer of the comments ive read along these lines in the last two years and yes we are biased biased in favor of the kindness at the heart of cooking through cooking we learn that when we take time to share kindness and care for those around us the world becomes a better place there was a time when this kindness was at home in both political parties for now at least those days are past reading all these emails has been an education at this point my response is if you werent hurting anyone you could believe whatever you wish and for the most part no one would say anything but you are hurting people by what your support is keeping in power your support of racism environmental devastation and the devaluation of our standing in the world is causing real harm not only to all of us right now but to future generations as well i understand how the realities our country is facing has been kept from you and that your thoughts are no longer entirely your own doesnt it seem odd to you how your mind can sincerely believe celebrities and business people should stay out of politics while at the very same time being equally sincerely excited about your celebrity businessman president and i have no doubt that you love this country but doesnt it somewhere deep down bother you that we are turning our allies against us while empowering and enriching those who would do us harm somewhere along the way you gave up something inside you of who you are something so fundamental to the functioning of democracy where once you would have held deep distrust for any candidate keeping their tax returns hidden you came to see the hiding of the truth as admirable where once you saw loyalty as key to character now it sure seems you are totally fine with third spouses playboy models and adult industry workers for all ive known and enjoyed conservatives all my life and i have to be honest with you and say this just does not sound like you please wake up your country needs you the good news is that a whole lot of people who were supporting all of this just a short while ago are now waking up and rejecting the personality cult the republican party has become and are instead finding their own path weve also seen posted recently i didnt choose to leave the republican party the republican party chose to leave me i and the rest of my family were born and bred republicans donated canvased for votes both doortodoor and by phone worked the polls and this current republican party in no way resembles the party we supported i really cant view it as republican i am a lifelong republican and have never been more embarrassed to say so i am working diligently in my state of nh to get democrats elected do not let the label you have slapped on yourself not reflect the truth of what you believe i grew up in a republican family and heck even my mom is not republican anymore the even better news is if you choose to make the change from everything weve seen a whole lot of people will be reallyreally happy that you did and they will welcome you with wide open arms as much as the president himself is pushing the false notion that those who oppose him are driven by hate and anger this simply is not true hate doesnt drive people to work for transgender rights racial equality or the welcoming of asylum seekers just the opposite really for anyone who has come around to realizing supporting the president and those enabling him was a mistake but are now worried about how they will be treated if they come out and make the change please do not be really kind people are going to be very happy for you right now it is not about where you have been so much as about where youve arrived and now is a good time to arrive at a good place i think you will find the food tasty here too not a lot of lonely desktop taco salads and buckets of deepfried fast food a big part of the fun in celebrating all the cultures that actually make america great is the cooks you meet and the foods they share dig in the election is now right around the corner as much as we believe every night is a good night to cook and there

it can be assumed that in austria too the costs of overcoming the crisis will be paid by the employed the unemployed pensioners epus and smes  unless we fight back together

it is necessary to take a clear position right now  even if the immediate consequences of the corona pandemic are only partially apparent
system change not climate change because capitalism is leading the entire planet into the abyss

1,today our friends at northside transformative law center succeeding in getting marquise is murder case dismissed after he spent years in cook county jail marquise is case is a critical reminder that the presumption of innocence applies to everyone who is accused of a crime not only people who are charged with minor offenses whether it was because he couldnt afford to pay his bond or because he was not given bond marquise is freedom was taken away before trial and he will never get those years back here is ntlc is full press release about the story in a tremendous victory the northside transformative law center ntlc and willis and associates secured the dismissal of murder charges against yearold marquise willis mr willis spent over two years in cook county jail falsely accused of killing one of his closest friends we welcome the state is attorney is decision to dismiss a case that should never have been charged in the first place says ntlc attorney emmanuel andre looking at the evidence we cannot understand why this case was ever pursued the victim is family consistently told law enforcement and investigators that marquise was not the person responsible for the murder of their loved one once marquise was arrested and charges were approved he was treated as guilty until we could prove his innocence fortunately with hard work and the support of the victim is family we were able to do so ntlc hopes that the chicago police department will assign new law enforcement personnel to conduct an independent investigation in order to explain the false arrest of marquise willis and help the victim is family find closure marquise and his family seek a formal apology from the state is attorney is office and the chicago police department for the unsubstantiated arrest prosecution and detention of marquise willis additionally there are extremely important lessons that decision makers in the criminal justice system should learn from this situation this young man was devastated after being locked up away from his loved ones and deprived of his freedom while falsely accused of murdering his friend mr willis will never get back the time he spent in cook county jail and his family will bear the consequences and scars of this injustice throughout their lives we are grateful to everyone who worked tirelessly to see justice prevail in this case says andre at the same time it is unfortunate that our larger community failed to protect a young man from a broken system that claims far too many lives there are lessons to be learned and substantive changes to our legal system are long overdue as marquise navigates the complicated transition back into society we ask that community service providers and small businesses join together to help marquise in the form of employment education and health care that he greatly needs

since then we have gone through many difficult situations and everything was possible through the direct involvement of romanians either by participating in the vote or by the way they understood to respect in an exemplary way the recommendations and restrictions imposed in the context of the pandemic
first president klaus iohannis the pnl candidate won the presidential election and we bravely took over the government then together we managed a very difficult situation unprecedented the health crisis generated by the new coronavirus and we managed to get through this major challenge much better than many other european countries
a year has passed and today is psd did not understand the message sent by romanians in may 2019 it still pursues politics against romanians through the toxic majority it holds in parliament it is an antieuropean antidemocratic antieuropean party independent justice a party that expelled millions of romanians from the country and endangered the future of other generations of young people and children
but the pnl government is doing its job we will soon implement the reconstruction and economic recovery after a very difficult period and we will continue to govern exclusively in the interest of romanians as we have done so far

1,"i dont know if youve seen this before but now locean mousse
every time the ocean gets a little choppy now it starts foaming up
the situation could seem poetic and i admit that it is even very pretty all these beaches covered with small piles of moss except that it is not foam and this foam is not at all natural this foam is unfortunately laundry and the sea spray starts to smell of laundry scents
why because with each machine 50 liters of water are rejected and the treatment plants are unfortunately not able to filter everything as a result laundry detergent ends up in our oceans
you use pimpant because you have chosen an easily biodegradable detergent a natural simple and effective alternative to current detergents which lead to water and soil pollution
together we can act
because the world is what you make of it do not hesitate to recommend pimpant around you there are no small gestures when there are 60 million to do them"

1,"the author steven schwartzberg holds a phd in history yale 96 is a former candidate for congress in the illinois 5th district and is also the author of democracy and us policy in latin america during the truman years as well as of a manuscript arguments over genocide the war of words over cherokee removal in the congress and the supreme court
the most brilliant revolutionary among the founders of the united states and the framers of the american constitution was arguably the pennsylvanian jurist james wilson 1 wilson is approach to domestic and foreign policy make him in many ways a precursor to social democratic and democratic socialist politics in seeking a path forward for american foreign policy it is worth returning to our earliest sources of moral purpose as a nation such a return would help contribute to a new spirit of generosity that our world needs its outline can be illuminated by reference to what our policy should be toward the militarily weakest and the militarily strongest of the other nations with whom the united states has relations we must learn again what the most progressive among the founding generation of americans knew that we are obliged to respectas our sovereign equals under the law of nationsboth the mightiest of the great powers and the most vulnerable of the native american peoples
disrespect for both and for many nations of intermediate military strength has been and continues to be the bipartisan foreign policy establishment is consensus approach it is evident in donald trump is aggressive trade war against china which has generated losses and hard feelings on both sides that may come to dwarf the costs associated with intellectual property theft by comparison it is also evident in a recent advertisement from the joe biden campaign which portrays trump as having rolled over for the chinese rather than demand at the outset that american scientific and medical personnel be admitted to china to help respond to the coronavirus 2
as for the treaty rights of the native peoples the united states has violated them ever since john marshall is wrongly decided opinion in cherokee nation v georgia in 1831 marshall is conclusion if the cherokee nation have rights this is not the tribunal in which those rights are to be asserted was in effect a tacit authorization to the advocates of ethnic cleansing to commit their genocide and pressure the native peoples east of the mississippi onto the trail of tears 3 when trump seeks to wipe a native people off the mapby denying the mashpee wampanoag the territorial basis of their nationalityhe is continuing what the genocidal policy of the 1830s left undone 4
the equality of all international persons as james wilson made clear in his law lectures in 179091 is what membership in the society of nations is all about
this equality of nations is the great and general foundation of national rights in this matter no regard is had to names of the great theater of the world empires kingdoms commonwealths principalities dukedoms free towns are all equally imperial a society which without subordination to any other exercises within itself all the essential powers of society is sovereign and has all the rights of a sovereign and independent state however narrow its territories however small its numbers may be 5
as early as july 1776 wilson had insisted to the continental congress that we have no right over the indians whether within or without the real or pretended limits of any colony 6 years before thomas jefferson wilson had written that all men are by nature equal and free 7 slavery wilson wrote is unauthorized by the common law and is repugnant to the principles of natural law 8 well aware of the compromises he had made over the existence of slavery in the constitutional convention wilson still looked forward to the future with hope at last however the voice of nature intelligible and persuasive has been heard by nations that are civilized at last it is acknowledged that mankind are all brothers the happy time is we hope approaching when the acknowledgment will be substantiated by a uniform corresponding conduct9
the american people wilson maintained in chisholm v georgia in 1793 are meant to be sovereigns without subjects 10 this wasand isa succinct way of stating the most basic ideal of the american revolution and the most basic principle of american social democracy it took the civil war and the civil rights movement to begin to make wilson is vision of the american people as sovereigns without subjects true for african americans it took the suffragists and the women is movement to begin to make this vision true for american women and it took the emergence of trade unions and the labor movement to begin to help keep workers from being made into the subjects of those who employ them if the promissory note of which martin luther king jr spoke was written on the account of the framers of the constitution it was wilson is signature on the check ultimately we must seek to extend the redemption of that promissory note to all the world is peoples to treat all with justice and to repudiate the arrogance and bullyingsome would say the imperialismthat has all too often marred our policy
wilson argued thatas the natural law of sovereignsinternational law was ultimately of divine origin the first and most necessary duty of nations as well as of individuals was to do no harm but they were also commanded to do good to one another sociability was part of the law of nature for nations as well as for individuals 11 drawing on this vision of a divinely mandated international sociability under the rule of law wilson gave voice to the most radical foundation for american foreign policy that has ever been articulated
it may perhaps be uncommon but it is certainly just to say that nations ought to love one another the offices of humanity ought to flow from this pure source when this happily is the case then the principles of affection and friendship prevail among states as among individuals then nations will mutually support and assist each other with zeal and ardour lasting peace will be the result of unshaken confidence and kind and generous principles of a nature far opposite to mean jealously crooked policy or cold prudence will govern and prosper the affairs of men 12
if the goal of life as senator bernard sanders and others over the years have suggested is to bring us together in love and compassion then we might think about this goalfor each of usas one of cultivating the fullness of our humanity andfor all of usas building a more just and democratic society and a more perfect union not only within the united states but in the wider world as well 13 there will be a great need after the crisis of the current pandemic has passed for a global green new dealincluding a green marshall plan for the most devastated countries seeking to rebuildand only together through such a program will the world be able to grapple with climate change there is a place in responding to such need for american leadershipbut the leadership of generosity not of bullying
a healthy society should know that it rests on the fellow feeling that its nationals have for one another and know that this feelingthis affinityis in its own dim way part of the love out of which the universe is made such a society should seek to avoid acting out of fear and to the extent possible act instead out of a concern for the common goodincluding the global common goodwhose advancement will ultimately best serve its own interests the heart of a social democratic foreign policy is not much more complicated than that a vision of sharing enlightened selfinterest with all nations willing to joinon the basis of juridical equalityin that endeavor the heart of a democratic socialist foreign policy is even more simple if perhaps more militant a visionlike james wilson isof sharing love

1,hello my name is ami dar i am the founder of idealistorg  and i want to tell you a story i want to share this because i suspect that in your own life youve faced similar situations and if you have i believe that together we can change the world starting right now i was born in jerusalem and raised mostly in peru and in mexico when i was 15 my family moved back to israel and at 18 i was drafted into the israeli army for three years of compulsory service a year lat  er my unit was stationed on the syrian border and my job was to spend several hours each day alone on a watchtower looking through a telescope across the barbed wire and the minefields trying to spot any strange movements on the other side one afternooni remember it was a cool beautiful winter dayi suddenly had a thought that made me laugh out loud i laughed because the idea was childish but also true in that way that children have of recognizing the truth a few months earlier getting to know the guys in my unit id realized gratefully that some of them would give me their last pair of dry socks if i ever needed them but there were also a few who might steal mine if i wasnt careful that image was on my mind that afternoon when through the telescope i saw a group of syrian soldiers playing a game of soccer across the valley that separated us and instantly something about the situationthat moment of play their running around like kidshumanized them in my eyes in a way that was entirely new and fresh and different when you grow up in a conflict zone or in any fragmented society it is natural for each side to dehumanize the other but if that filter shatters you can never go back and the moment their full humanity struck me i had that crazy thought that changed my life wait a minute wait a minute i thought if in my unit and in every other unit i know there are some guys id trust with my life and others id rather stay away from then in that unit this must also be the case and if that is true then this whole border fence is running the wrong way instead of syrians on one side and israelis on the other wouldnt it make more sense for the socksharers on both sides to get together and that is when i laughed i laughed yet this idea stayed with me and still haunts me now since then ive learned that life is more complicated and that the line between good and bad runs within each of us and yet i cant help noticing that all over the world behind every label and stereotype there are people who share some basic values and i cant help thinking that if these people could somehow work together the world would be a very different place what are these values treating others the way wed like to be treated is a good start but we can go beyond that for example i believe that in every country and every culture there are many people who would agree with this sentence working with others in a spirit of generosity and mutual respect i want to help build a world where all people can lead free and dignified lives and more i believe that many of these people would be happy to work together on the single biggest challenge we all share closing the gap that exists everywhere between our good intentions and the actions we actually take if you are still with me you know what i mean every day many of us would like to respond in some way to what is happening around us but for a variety of reasons we do not we may feel that we have no time no resources no power or no impact we may not know where to start what to do or who to work with we may be afraid of failure ridicule meetings and committees wasting our time getting depressed this list could go on but the point is that this challengeor opportunityis huge think how many times youve felt this way now multiply that by every person whod recognize this feeling and we are talking about millions of missed opportunities for action and collaboration every day now imagine a different world  imagine if these peoplethe socksharers the practical dreamers the twenty people youd take with you if you had to spend a couple of years on a desert island imagine if these people could easily connect across all the lines that divide us  imagine usyou me and everyone who wants to join us doing whatever it takes to make it easier for people everywhere to move from intention to action  imagine using every available toolfrom mobile apps to a bulletin board on a village treeto match needs ideas and opportunities with people organizations and resources  imagine reading the news and having an act button that would let us do something about what wed just read  imagine if in addition to hotlines for emergencies we also had a hotline for projects and dreams  imagine wherever you are that once a month on 77 88 99 etc we organized idealist days that made it okay and more than okay to spark and celebrate action and possibility freedom and dignity  imagine in brief that together we could narrow the gap between what is and what could be between what we know in our hearts to be possible and the reality we see around us we can do all this and we can do it now we just need to start but to start we need to know where we are going so here is the whole idea in a few words what do we want to change the world from the ground up how by closing the gap between intention and action yes but how by inviting people everywhere to imagine connect and act  imagine a better world a better community and a better life  connect with others and share ideas skills and resources  act on our good intentions and help others to act on theirs who will make this happen the world is idealists idealists yes practical dreamers who want to help build a world where all people can lead free and dignified lives and they would promote and facilitate action and collaboration using every available means how do we start by seeing our shared humanity and then then we get organized plan the next idealist day and invite everyone around us to imagine connect and act and then day by day month by month we continue building a whole ecosystem of possibilitythat act button that hotline a good mobile app to wake up to in the morningso that no opportunity for action or collaboration is missed or wasted as we do all this well run into all kinds of challenges some of these will be tougher than others but the thing about us humans is that once we commit to a big goalin this case closing the gap between intention and actionwe are very good at figuring out how to get there wherever you are you can make this happen and together we can push the limits of what seems possible in our lives and in our communities how far let is find out if this invitation speaks to you please join us in this group and let is make this happen

1,"fifty years ago the first earthday created a movement that changed how societies organized around environmental issues today as we mark that 50th anniversary we must also recognize the threats against sound progressive environmental policy
the fight for environmental justice is central to my entire career in public life like so many of you i have long believed that we cannot ensure a better future for all americans without preserving the natural world around us  not just for this time for the times to come this fight is personal to me and even as we must consider earth day while socially distanced during this time of crisis i believe we can come together to ensure that when americans mark the 100th anniversary of earth day they will do so in a remarkably different country
that means we must fight now
trump is pulling america out of the paris climate accord he has loosened offshore drilling safety regulations dramatically reduced car fueleconomy standards and even reduced regulation of methane emissions which contributes to climate change
i have fought against all of trump is antienvironment actions and have taken action to protect our environment and combat climate change
when trump wanted the clean power plan to allow states to set their own limits on coalfired and other power plants i made it clear to him and republicans that air pollution does not care about state lines
here in our congressional district i worked to stop the coastguard from putting anchorage sites for barges carrying hazardous materials on the hudson river i cosponsored the law that provided millions in federal funds to restore and protect the long island sound and am working to obtain additional funding
i am also an original cosponsor of the green new deal a comprehensive approach to tackling climate change by completely overhauling the nation is energy sector it will dramatically improve our environment including ending our use of fossil fuel and achieve netzero greenhouse gas emissions by expanding job opportunities for americans in the burgeoning clean energy sector the green new deal will ensure that as our energy sector transforms so too will our economy no longer will a select few stand to gain from the economic prosperity a 21stcentury economy can offer
my work in congress has earned a 100 proenvironment rating from the league of conservation voters and clean water action and i have already been endorsed by the sierra club when the innovative climate action now act was proposed in the house i personally shepherded the bill through the foreign affairs committee and made certain that it passed
like you i have watched the unintended environmental benefits of this terrible pandemic with a sense of wonder cleaner air clearer water less dependency on fossil fuels it is that perhaps brief vision of where we might go as a society that helps me get through this current crisis
as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of earth day let us also renew our own commitment to environmental justice when the young environmental activist greta thunberg came before my committee her words were prophetic i want you to listen to the scientists and i want you to unite behind the science and then i want you to take action she was absolutely right
cleaner air clearer water ending dependency on fossil fuels is a commitment that i am again renewing on this earth day i hope you will too
stay safe stay healthy let is keep fighting together

1,im grateful to robert f kennedy jr jenny mccarthy mark blaxill dr paul thomas dr chris exley and jennifer margulis phd all of whom have provided reviews of my book included below the book remains at in the autismasperger is category because of the choice of so many of you to preorder the book which will be released on september th thank you for your support and if you have not preordered i hope you consider doing so jb handley is arguably the worlds most thoughtful sophisticated knowledgeable and indefatigable activist for childrens health and safety as a frontline leader for fifteen years handley has led the big fistfight against the pharma cartel to force the issue broadcast the science and expose the lies behind the vaccine policies that have created an epidemic of chronic disease among our children handley has helped bring the issue of toxins in medical products and regulatory corruption to a tipping point handleys advocacy has lifted the curtain of lies behind which the autism epidemic has sprouted when we end this cataclysm it will be thanks to the dogged character of people like jb handley who have refused to rest in his battle to support parents protect children bring justice to injured families and to punish those responsible for one of the worst scandals in american history please read this book and decide for yourself if you still believe that vaccines are safe and effective robert f kennedy jr i honestly believe jb handley wrote the book that will end the autism epidemic as i sit here now in stillness i want to jump up and down with excitement but im holding back rivers of tears he breaks down the scientific information in a way that doesnt intimidate the reader and he lets us know its okay to be angry his soul his fight his love for his son radiates off the pages wow bravo bravo jenny mccarthy author of louder than words coauthor of healing and preventing autism this book is inspired powerful the unadulterated truth and a must read we have sacrificed too many children at the vaccine altar while our blind belief in the cdc and aap government and the media has prevented us from seeing the conflicts of interest that enable big business and big pharma to profit at the expense of our childrens health how to end the autism epidemic is one familys story but it is sadly also a story shared by millions of families a beautiful normal baby vaccinated and then lost to autism and all the horrible medical conditions associated with immune devastation and brain toxicity thank you jb for sharing your story and wisdom parents and future parents read this book now and say no to business as usual and the status quo if your pediatrician has not yet done his or her own research and is just parroting the vaccines are safe and effective marketing phrase it is time for you to get a new pediatrician paul thomas md coauthor of the vaccinefriendly plan and the addiction spectrum as parents our job is to be concerned about our childrens health yet every day in doctors offices around the country american parents are told we are being irresponsible or selfish just for asking questions about vaccines we all want to keep our children safe and healthy both from infectious diseases and from overexposure to toxins its reasonable to be concerned that there are too many vaccines on the schedule and that medications like antibiotics acetaminophen and adhd drugs are being overprescribed whats a worried parent to do for starters read this book sharing his personal story as the father of a boy with autism and taking a close look at the most recent and rigorous science stanfordeducated jb handley shows how the cdcs aggressive childhood vaccine schedule is connected to the astonishing rise in autism in the united states how to end the autism epidemic is a direct challenge to the american public health establishment and a gift to the millions of parents who find themselves caught in the crosshairsuncertain of what to think or doof the seemingly intractable debate about vaccines jennifer margulis phd author of your baby your way coauthor of the vaccinefriendly plan i have been thinking about the toxicity of aluminum for thirtyfive years it is my lifes work before we completed our recent research on aluminum in brain tissue in autism i could not see a direct link between human exposure to aluminum and autism i certainly saw no immediate role for aluminum adjuvants in vaccines in autism the missing link was a mechanism whereby the brain would be subjected to an acute exposure to aluminum for example as occurs in aluminuminduced dialysis encephalopathy proinflammatory cells some originating from blood and lymph heavily loaded with a cargo of aluminum in brain tissue in autism provided that missing link we all tolerate the toxicity of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines unfortunately some of us are predisposed to suffer as opposed to tolerate the toxicity of aluminum adjuvants and this may cause autism autism is a disease and it is not inevitable jb handleys elegant synthesis of what we know and what we need to know argues that autism could and should be preventable i agree with him professor christopher exley phd fellow royal society of biology professor of bioinorganic chemistry keele university jb handley tells it like it is his new book is a masterful synthesis of all the latest threads of autism the controversies the science the legal and policy battles and the human dimension of the movement that has inspired so many of us to become parent activists peppered with jawdropping new developmentsincluding depositions from major vaccine science luminarieshandley weaves a compelling narrative and cuts through the noise to make a powerful and convincing case read it process what hes telling you and then stand up and do something about it the health of generations of children is at stake mark blaxill coauthor of the age of autism vaccines and denial

the dutch built cities on sinking land how will this fair with climatechange
what fascinates me is how the uk could take a leaf from the dutch is book and protect our floodplains by creating dikes  walls in strategically located coastal areas that can create a barrier for flood protection to flood plain areas whilst in some cases other strategically located coastal areas where high risk of flooding is stemmed from could let water fall into manmade basins to create a lakereservoir for the water to spill into so that the construction of micro or large hydropower electricity plants on a regional national or as an international conglomerate can be made this would ultimately reduce the risk of increase flooding or drought in the future at the same time as generating large scale clean and more cost effective renewable energy
the challenges of climate change
climatechange brings new challenges as tides are rising and storms are getting fiercer instead of denying that climate change is real the dutch are taking a seemingly counterintuitive approach by letting water in that means devising lakes the water can spill into why cant we sometimes our problem becomes our solution and our weakness becomes our strength

1,"as a member of a modern vanguard of photographers photojournalist and portraitist lynsey weatherspoon says she is often called on to capture heritage and history in real time amid ongoing protests for racial equality and social justice she photographed citizens of atlanta who are active in the black lives matters movement
weve always been a family that has stood up and so it was very important to me that my son and my nephew see what that looks like says atlantabased writer and producer sherri daye scott i needed it it was really beautiful to be out there and see all these other people so in some ways it was selfish i needed to be surrounded by folks who reminded me that i am not in this alone
i just felt like it wasnt an opportunity to just sit idly by and do nothing i think it is easy for us to just sit and kind of be like oh that is terrible that happened and that is it says tiffany powell a freelance portrait photographer who attended protests with her yearold son jackson i just wanted to lend a voice the pulse of what was going on there was just so much energy and passion that it kept drawing me back out
i do think we are entering some pivotal moment of whether or not these protests as great as theyve been are going to actually bring out some of the changes that i think we all want and i think that is still up in the air says kamau franklin but i think the amount of energy the dedication the anger that people have been feeling is something that has broken through by lnweatherspoon"

1,this is a disclaimer that this ad is by tariq albazzaz administrator of this page immigration dilemma torn families the wall and no illegal human racist and bigot is definitely thrown around a lot today videos of white nationalists or crimes against minorities are shown in the news and on social media frequently news reports of children torn from parents have been catching headlines people talk about how ridiculous the idea of a border wall is and some are suggesting that no human being is illegal ie anyone should be able to come and have the opportunity to live in america and enjoy it as any citizen would suggesting migration controls tends to bring up the words starting this article and one underlying theme seems to be that the current president has caused undercover racism to come out into the open and even created racism among people where there once was little to none after all its suggested that the united states has always welcomed immigrants in a white house press briefing the cnn reporter jim acosta spoke about the statue of liberty and how inscribed on it are the words give me your tired your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free it definitely sounds inspiring so lets take a look at the immigration policies of the united states in the past how governments debate create and enforce immigration laws and a generally more detailed picture of what is being discussed go to new york and you can see people of all colors with many different languages being spoken i remember as a child being taught in a school textbook that new york was considered the melting pot of the us we learned about how immigrants came to ellis island from europe and contributed to the country that we know today what wasnt in the textbook was the fact that immigration policy at the time was actually much less open and was much more strict than today explicitly excluding many asian immigrants while being more open to those viewed as more similar in culture and skin tone the europeans if you really think about it this shouldnt be very surprising if american society discriminated and discriminates today against those of african descent why not others in fact even those white europeans faced discrimination and there were calls for more controls on immigration to the us as more immigrants came in the emergency quota act was put into law which explicitly restricted the annual number of immigrants from any one country to of the total from that country counted in the us census of then in a stricter law was enacted lowering that to and only allowing that percentage from the lower number in the us census of that doesnt sound like we were so willing to take in all those huddled masses as jim acosta said obviously this has come up before and nothing seriously suggested today by the white house or congress comes close to explicitly restricting immigration as was done during the time we had started to supposedly become such a melting pot and bastien of open borders and people of many colors and cultures beyond those schoolbook lies the reality of immigration and how countries control flows of people became more apparent to me over the years i remember hearing of illegal immigrants working in the crop fields of my small hometown in georgia when i was still in elementary school at the time i had just moved to rural georgia from the washington dc area where i had spent the prior years i have visual memories of seeing hispanic workers in the hot sunbaked fields picking cabbage and other crops and of them coming in old schoolbuses to the local walmart shopping supercenter to buy groceries and other necessities one day i remember they formed a line in the parking lot and at the front of the line was a towel laid on the pavement with loaves of bread and packs of what looked like bologna a couple people put the sandwiches together handed them to the person at the front of the line and the next person came forward to get their sandwich their clothes were tattered and i dont remember hearing them speak english it was common knowledge that they worked very hard and accepted low wages for that pay for farmers and contractors it was a winwin more labor for less money when i worked at a beef manufacturing plant when i was the next station on the factory line was all staffed by mexican immigrants they couldnt speak english but we became good friends joked and helped each other make the day go by faster i even learned a little spanish mostly bad words my hometown in georgia also had immigrants from india who owned many or most of the gas stations in the town after moving to ny several years later i began to be exposed to more immigrants now from all over the world my own father came from baghdad iraq in to the united states but it was when i moved to japan that i became much more directly aware and involved with immigration before then i didnt know much about what a visa was but now i knew that a visa was a temporary permit for residency given to you by the country as an immigrant i remembered asian friends in ny telling me about their difficulties in getting visas for work in the us now that i had to get a visa myself i learned a visa would dictate what you had been granted temporary residency for work school marriage to a citizen etc it also stated the period of time the permit was valid for a period of months years or indefinitely now it was clear to me that nations controlled who came and went into their country you are told what you are allowed to do under that arrangement such as work in specific jobs and how long you are allowed to stay in parliaments across europe in congress in the us worldwide this is something that is discussed and debated among all political parties with clear rules and limits put into place in fact this comes full circle to a fact the news almost always fails to ensure the public is reminded we have immigration controls and so do all other nations you cannot simply go to another country and decide you will now live there in fact in many you cannot even visit without applying directly to the immigration bureau of that country it is a crucial role of a government to control its borders and the flow of people through it imagine if the us simply let anyone into the country the policy would be if you can get here you can stay and work and would be granted all the rights of domestic citizens people would flood into the country from other nations probably mostly poorer nations because they would want to take the opportunity to show that they can work hard and are hungry to make a better life for themselves housing costs would likely go up wages would likely go down it would probably not work very well for the prior domestic residents if youve stayed up late at night youve probably seen the commercials where for only a penny a day you can sponsor a poor child in a poor country this is a sad reality its been said that half of the worlds population lives on less than per day the amount of struggling poor around the globe is much much larger than the number of people in the us the idea of a union of countries with blanket access and free movement of people to live and work is something that has been done right now the european union is comprised of countries with this free movement policy called the schengen area one key distinction must be made these are not the most impoverished nations in the world so the free movement of people from for example subsaharan africa does not come under the terms of this agreement however the eu has allowed many refugees from syria or africa to settle in the region this has created huge debate and controversy with political parties promoting less immigration garnering more support and winning elections in hungary and slovenia this has become a reality against the will of the governing body of the eu those nations have installed border fences and walls to prevent those from coming into their countries spain has also done the same italy has had immigration at the forefront of its recent elections apparently the notion of a border barrier such as a wall is not out of the ordinary one big event came in which is very similar and related to the immigration debate put forth in donald trumps campaign in june of that year the citizens of the united kingdom voted to leave the eu many analysts and research suggested the single largest issue for citizens and the vote out was the policy of open borders to anyone from this immigration union of nations clearly the issue of immigration is not confined to the united states this has become a global issue in spite of the fact that construction at the border is going on around the world the idea that the government construct a wall on our border is portrayed as ridiculous by many news organizations the uks vote to leave the eu seemed to stem from legal immigration however in the us illegal immigration tends to get much more media attention so how do immigrants become illegal in the us the two most prevalent ways are crossing the border without going through a checkpoint such as in the desert or through a tunnel or being issued a visa granted for a set period but then staying inside the country beyond that allowed period going from legal resident to illegal resident in there were approximately border arrests from people doing this the number of people successful is less clear and is estimated to be anywhere from to another way people gain access is by claiming asylum although the numbers of people doing so is far less to attain refugee status after claiming asylum an individual must prove they fit the following criteria an individual must have suffered persecution or fear suffering persecution because of race religion nationality political opinion or membership in a particular social group what is often left out is the attitude towards immigrants and asylees in mexico mexico deports many who try to enter their own borders a report this year from amnesty international found that of immigrants were not informed of their right to seek asylum even though it is required by mexican law the country also deported more immigrants per capita than the united states only of mexicos population is foreign whereas the uss number is around its even stated in mexican law that the country may deny entry to anyone in order to maintain its demographic balance mexico also much more easily grants visas to those from wealthier countries at the same time the government has published literature in the past advising illegal immigrants in the united states on how to avoid us immigration officials for a country that chastises the administration for the idea of a border wall this all sounds hypocritical there is also the issue of children being held in detention centers in the us the news media makes it seem as if this began since the election however this has been publicized and ongoing under past administrations such as the obama administration under which the record number of deportations occurred additionally the government tries to release most children to sponsors such as family while this is definitely something the government should address framing seems to be more popular than discussing realities the facts on immigration never seem to be laid bare in mainstream news articles if this has been ongoing with child detainees why hasnt this been addressed before what should the government do to more fairly accommodate those detained who illegally reside in the us while also deterring illegal immigration discussions shouldnt always include racist remarks of drug dealers or rapists many simply want to live a better life however it also shouldnt include racist or bigot for suggesting that a line be drawn there has always been a line drawn for all countries

1,come let us adore him now at this time mary arose and hurried to the hill country to a city of judah judea and she entered the house of zacharias and greeted elizabeth here is to me the most exciting spiritual event that happened in the christmas story pay strict attention to what went on here i have never heard it taught in the church in detail it is so cool when elizabeth heard marys greeting her baby leaped in her womb and elizabeth was filled with the holy spirit and empowered by him and she exclaimed loudly blessed worthy to be praised are you among women and blessed is the fruit of your womb and how has it happened to me that the mother of my lord would come to me for behold when the sound of your greeting reached my ears the baby in my womb leaped for joy and blessed spiritually fortunate and favored by god is she who believed and confidently trusted that there would be a fulfillment of the things that were spoken to her by the angel sent from the lord one of my most frequently asked questions is this pastor allen if jesus aint gonna do nothin because he already did everything and he already answered all of my prayers and has already given to me all things that pertain to life and godliness what do i have to do to receive all of those great and precious blood guaranteed promises of jesus the answer is in that scripture blessed is she who believed and confidently trusted that there would be a fulfillment of the things that wwere spoken to her from the lord be honest with yourself and ask if a you know all of the things that were promised you from the lord b do you believe all of the things that were promised you by jesus do you believe that jesus healed every disease known and unknown to man on the cross isaiah matthew psalm do you believe that jesus forgave and chose to never remember your sins all of them past present and future once and for allhebrews hebrews psalms amp zephaniah do you believe that jesus defeated satan and gave you dominion over him and all of his powers luke do you believe that jesus gave you the power to do the same things that he did and even greater things and that he promised to do whatever you ask of him john do you believe that jesus has given you the power to speak and command all things and that they must obey you mark go back and reread those verses over and over until you get what happened think about this mary was not showing she had just then been impregnated by the holy spirit elizabeth had no way to know that she was pregnant she especially had no way to know that mary would deliver god into the world in a flesh suit nor did she know what mary said to gabriel elizabeth had no means by which she could know what marys reaction to gabriel was here is what happened remember that gabriel told zachariah that john elizabeths son would be filled with the holy spirit from conception when mary stood in the presence of john in elizabeths womb john drunk in the power of the holy spirit leaped for joy because he knew that he was in the presence of god at that instant elizabeth was filled with the holy spirit and was given spiritual vision and understanding she knew everything in the blink of an eye doesnt that scene send cold chills up your spine who could have made up such an event read this astonishing faith statement from mary catholics know marys dissertation as the magnificat jesus never asked us to make confessions if he had this would be the perfect example along with the psalms of david of what he would like it is an effervescent joyful loving positive and happy prophetic praise to god the father born in faith beyond comprehension the magnificat is one of the many reasons that i admire mary and mary said my soul magnifies and exalts the lord and my spirit has rejoiced in god my savior for he has looked with loving care on the humble state of his maidservant for behold from now on all generations will count me blessed and happy and favored by god for he who is mighty has done great things for me and holy is his name to be worshiped in his purity majesty and gloryand his mercy is upon generation after generation toward those who stand in great awe of god and fear him he has done mighty deeds with his powerful arm he has scattered those who were proud in the thoughts of their heart he has brought down rulers from their thrones and exalted those who were humble he has filled the hungry with good things and sent the rich away emptyhanded he has helped his servant israel in remembrance of his mercy just as he promised to our fathers to abraham and to his descendants forever and mary stayed with elizabeth for about three months and then returned to her home please reread this power packed message to you from the holy spirit it is life changing thank you all for your love and encouragement your kind and gracious comments just bless our socks off please keep sharing these teachings with your friends when you do you become and

this year the day takes on extra meaning as we recognize those who work to get us all through this crisis we thank the thousands of workers on the front lines across the union health workers emergency responders nurses factory workers supermarket cashiers cleaners and garbage collectors for their selfless working for the protection and wellbeing of others in the coronavirus pandemic i am especially grateful to women who make up the overwhelming majority of workers in the health and care sector and are undervalued said eu social affairs commissioner nicolas schmit
however the crisis is also showing us that the eu initiatives on employment and social policy that have already been announced are still relevant
we must focus our efforts on tackling unemployment ensuring job security protecting the most vulnerable and investing in the skills people will need in an even more green and digital future and we must ensure that all workers including those on the front lines of this crisis are paid a wage that allows them to have a decent standard of living
therefore together with the social partners we will continue our work on a minimum wage initiative and on strengthening collective bargaining
later this year we will present another action plan to implement the principles of the european pillar of social rights be assured that the lessons learned during this crisis will be reflected in our proposals together we can overcome the crisis and create a just strong and social europe

with the european shorttime work benefit initiative sure we want to support the shorttime work programs in the eu countries in this way millions of jobs can be preserved during the crisis and companies can continue to operate if there are no orders for companies and they run out of work they should be able to keep their employees in the company
sure is supposed to compensate for the difference in income to this end we are proposing a 100 billion fund for workers the financial support for sure takes the form of a loan from the eu to the member states that request support the loans will be backed by guarantees from member states and will be used where they are most needed
all member states will be able to use the instrument but the loans will be particularly important for the most affected countries such as italy and spain
sure will support existing shorttime work schemes in eu countries which member states use to protect jobs and protect workers and the selfemployed against loss of income with the help of sure member states can cover costs arising from the introduction or extension of national shorttime work schemes

 like my page to get notices of new post thank u
what about the earth     psalm 187 god controls earthquakes     2 samuel 228 god controls the severity of earthquakes    isaiah 241 god can rearrange his creation when and how he wants to accomplish his will
   psalm 468 god controls where life grows     psalm 10414 god controls where food will grow     hosea 222 god controls where grain wine and oil is produced on earth oil is a natural source for energy and it comes from god i guess environmentalists would say god polluted the earth
so why does a good god psalm 1361 allow natural disasters to deface his creation including killing humans in some cases if you recall creation was perfectly made and god saw that everything was very good not just good genesis 131 sin entered the world through the fall of adam and eve resulting in the curse of thorns and thistles on his creation and a physical death to all living things sin has consequences     romans 820 futility means devoid of truth perverseness and depravity
nature and the animal kingdom were forced into corruption and bondage by the free will of man to disobey god the end result the earth awaiting a new birth groans in agony and pain as a consequence of man is sin romans 822 however jesus is the truth and all of creation is hope because everything seen and unseen was made by for and through him     2 corinthians 62
this is why it is important to accept salvation from the lord today even more urgent than that now we are not guaranteed our next breath we are guaranteed to be in his presence upon death if we accept jesus as savior         2 corinthians 568 it is not by coincidence that the great commission follows jesus declarative statement of all power control and authority given to him     matthew 281819
what about the constellations     jeremiah 3135 everything god controls gives the sun gives light the moon and stars do the same rain gives nourishment for grass plants trees and food god the father gave his son jesus gave his life for us his sacrificial blood gives those who believe eternal life     luke 812 by contrast satan is a taker     psalm 7416    psalm 10419 god controls the sun and moon there is nothing mankind can do to prevent the intensity of the sun is energy or where and when it shines its light on earth
to drive the point home about absolute control authority and power over his creation god can supernaturally alter celestial objects the earth and heavens     joshua 1013 god can stop time since he is the author of time in this case god even gives us a clue that the earth rotates on an axis and around the sun the sun stood still and the moon rotates around the earth the moon stopped if the sun moved around the earth it would also need to be stopped
nicolaus copernicus has been credited in discovering that the earth orbits the sun in the 16th century the book of joshua was approximately written between 1400 and 1370 bc it took someone close to 3000 years after the above inspired scripture is penned to put two and two together during battle joshua prayed to the lord for the sun and moon to stop so he would have extra daylight to finish the task the result was time earth and moon stood still for hours   habakkuk 311
not only can god stop time he can also reverse it    2 kings 2011 king hezekiah was sick and near death when he tearfully prayed to the lord 2 kings 2013 god is response via the prophet isaiah was to heal hezekiah and add fifteen more years to his life 2 kings 2046 god controls every breath you take
not just taking isaiah is word for it hezekiah wanted a sign from god he would be healed 2 kings 208   isaiah 388 god caused the earth to rotate backwards on its axis and orbit around the sun in reverse for approximately 40 minutes imagine sunset dusk is upon you and the sun disappears over the horizon only to come back up and shine its light upon you for another 40 minutes     job 97 that is a sign that is control

1,impeach the president and the funding of fox too right now there are two types of americans both types know the presidents a liar know the presidents a cheater a bankrupt and more likely than not compromised by the russians the only difference is that one type believes what they know the other type has fox and its disinformation in their lives fox lies to its viewers and they are not random lies they are lies crafted to elect and support certain chosen politician s that these are the same politicians our nations enemies wish to see in office says everything we need to know about fox except for whos funding fox and why you may have seen how through an odd series of events suddenly penzeys was in the news this last week it all started with us being ranked number two in facebook impeachment ad spending to just the president himself and ended up with us making the last small stepgiant leap of officially being done with pretending there is anything at all rational about this president being in the white house or about the party supporting him your response was just take our money we said how about sending us new customers instead then sales went whoosh this is not your fathers capitalism we pledged to put all the dollars of the new customer spending you brought us over those three days into penzeys ads on impeachment and here we are why begin with the top funding fox truth is you can be the impeachiest impeacher who ever impeached and its still going to get you nowhere if you dont get to the root of the problem the issue here isnt the president hes just a symptom yes he has to go and judging from the latest house testimony the vice president as well but until americans address the disinformation machine of the republican party we are never going to rootout the corruption and cruelty that has overtaken the republican party we are a company of cooks who for some time now has believed you are what you advertise for us its about advertising the humankindness at the heart of cooking that when you care about others the world becomes a better place our somewhat unique style of marketing has made us the scouts riding up ahead of the pack doing our best to find the best way forward trying to see the future living in a time where political thought is no longer tied to rational thinking is no easy task no matter how many times you shake it the magic eight ball keeps coming up reply hazy try again later with us officially giving up on all the nonsensical reasons this president and his party hide behind weve already found in just a weeks time much has come into focus having passed through the fogginess of the irrational suddenly the future is right there out in front of us again from this plateau we now stand upon we can see the future is a hopeful one but it does look as though we are in for a substantial amount of turbulence before we get there the political landscape of america is in for the type of sudden shift we havent seen in close to fifty years you might want to buckle up one of the childhood memories that has stuck was when nixon was up for reelection in and i was just in elementary school our teacher asked if you could vote would you vote to reelect the president one other kid and i were the only ones to not raise ours hands flash forward two years to shortly after nixons resignation and our teacher asked who would have voted to reelect the president for a moment i was thinking great heres where my classmates admit they were wrong and i was right but it didnt play out that way this time it played out the exact opposite with only two kids raising their hands to admit they wanted nixon reelected of course third graders when it comes to voting are pretty much a reflection of their parents thoughts but this has stuck with me a long time as something i could never quite reconcile i liked my wauwatosa wilson elementary classmates they were good sorts but why would they lie about something as important and as fundamentally american as this now coming to grips with our own nixon and in backandforthing with so many customers i think i finally understand their thinking they werent lying at all they were actually telling their truth nixon won the election by a landslide yet two years later no one voted for him the thing was then like now his voters supported him because they believed him when he said he was not a crook once the process of impeachment began in the house of representatives and week by week the curtain was slowly pulled back the reality of the presidents crookedness became inescapable at that point his voters decided he was not who they thought they were voting for so therefore logically they didnt vote for him there is a lot of truth in this nixons supporters were unwavering right up until they wavered the parallels are strong to our time but just like nixons support was made up of voters who would never support a crook our presidents supporters are voters who would never support a cheating lying bankrupt russian government asset in the white house truth always outs and as much as we might hope the next step is a lot of republican voters taking responsibility for their actions thats not how humans work the next step is all about who to blame and it wont take long for the blame to arrive on those who worked to amplify foxs lies by funding their operation there was a time when every american ceo knew the lesson of what happened to those businesses in france that were seen as profiting from the nazi invasion and occupation oftentimes because those future ceos were marching through france on the way to germany when the retribution took place for the top fox funders ceos if movies are your thing i recommend owning casablanca and watching it often please pay close attention to the scene towards the end where captain renault realizes the bottle of water he is pouring from is labeled vichy the french collaborators and with new found resolve trashes it that bottle is your brand and captain renault is every future american consumer dropping your brand into the waste basket of history if black and white film is not quite your style maybe your best bet is tuning in to what is happening in hong kong not years ago but right this very moment it can seem like whats happening there is all random and chaotic but its not the peoples anger at those seen as promoting and profiting off the situation there is very much the same thing that will be happening here as reality settles in about how the enemies of our nation were able to gain influence over our highest offices of power right now as a top fox funder your fingerprints are all over this crime my advice is its time to get out a rag and start wiping please at some point google penzeys boycott our objection to the corruption and cruelty that has overtaken the republican party has taught us more than most about how boycotts work if you are a foxfunding ceo trust me what you will be facing will be farfar more than just a boycott this is about arriving at pariah status this is about people not being able to take your product out in public because of the backlash they will receive this is about the end of resale value your job is to not let it come to this please do your job this is not the week to name the names of the top fifty fox advertisers this is about giving them the benefit of the doubt and about giving them time to make a change decades back when so many of the foxfunding were just getting started maybe there was nothing wrong with marketing on the news of the left and of the right and everywhere in between but fox stopped being news a long time ago today advertising on fox is nothing more than writing a check to fund the lies that provide cover for the corruption and cruelty that has overtaken the republican party there is no hiding this anymore to the leaders of the foxfunding please think of me as someone trying to help you have some very serious and very real choices to make is a funder of fox who you want to be or not your advertising contracts all have behavior clauses that fox right now is in violation of just visit their website the lies that they are spinning about the impeachment process are beyond excuse think of how much better it would be if this chapter in your companys history was about you choosing to do whats right not your company being forced to do what is right please step up and show the leadership you want to be remembered for now please please please the first tuesday of next month marks one year from the next presidential election if at that point you are still funding fox then america will have your answer and we will know our pleas fell short if its that your company benefits from the corruption and cruelty of the republican party and you want to keep funding fox so be it then it will be time to name names then you and i will catch beef and even though we are a progressive company with a lot of great seasoning options for nonmeat meals trust me when i say we still have manymany ways to bring an endless variety of tastiness to a beef with you for me there is sadness in all this because so many of the foxfunding were up until now known as great american brands still if this is about clearing space for new american brands that celebrate the diversity and equality that fox and the republicans are doing everything they can to undermine then this is what this needs to be dang bill billpenzeyscom next time shorter and with recipes too i promise and with us trying to stretch our impeachment ad buy fund shares and comments mean more than ever also with us trying to amplify our message it would mean a lot if you could follow us on twitter penzeysspices and best of all sign up for our voice of cooking email list httpspicespenzeyscomvoicehtml thanks oh yeah and buying something at penzeyscom is how this all works our spices and seasonings are good and our gifts are worth giving next time i should probably put this closer to the top

1,executive director statement on december restinpower and end of the year fundraising i began volunteering as a board member with swopusa in the fall of i had been doing sex work formally for years and had been doing social justice organizing for i was raised as a liberal feminist and considered sex work to be a violation i actually protested a girls gone wild recording at a bar in my college town im ashamed of it but it happened at a certain point i r an out of money and had to take some time off of school i worked retail and it was grueling and i was constantly harassed by mall customers and employees despite my reservations i started doing sex work expecting to hate it but low and behold is has become my most longlasting and consistent work i came into this new project as many organizers do naive ambitious and with the firm belief that tremendous change was just around the corner after three years on the board and eventually transitioning to the role of inaugural executive director of swopusa i can rest assured it is a much longer journey than i had ever anticipated the fight for sex workers rights is complicated and nuanced best practices of the past are not sufficient we are at a crucial moment in the sex workers rights movement our elders fought long and hard for the safety and dignity that we benefit from today but it is not enough we come into another december th with staggering numbers of sex workers who have lost their lives to violence was a year that we saw brutal violence committed against women of color domestically abroad and at the border everyone knows and loves someone who is a sex worker and those sex workers intersect with and experience every other system of oppression and institution of violence decriminalization as a public health and harm reduction strategy remains an essential pillar of swopusa is mission additionally we must address the larger systems that would make decriminalization only a benefit to those already in positions of power criminalization spans much further than sex workers and it impacts us differently black and brown and trans individuals would continue to face extreme policing and violence even if we achieved decriminalization tomorrow our struggle must be intersectional or it is lost this past october the swopusa board of directors and myself participated in the early stages of our strategic planning one of the processes we engaged with was to imagine what december th events could look like in years it was a struggle for many of us to look so far into the future and try to imagine something brighter more just a world transitioning away from white supremacy and criminalization one of the most tangible points that came out of this conversation was that up until now we have only honored sex workers who have lost their lives we had previously failed to name many other forms of violence violence that is not always immediately fatal such as incarceration violence resulting from white supremacy trans erasure stigma poverty drug use and so much more this year and for all the years to come we must center the voices and experiences of those impacted by all forms of criminalization we believe that the work of building power and developing activists skills is essential to moving forward as a movement we need a movement of leaders if we want to win and we believe that sex workers will win we could not do this work without our direct community or our generous donors and funders we did not meet our goals for foundation funding for as unfortunately few foundations directly support our fight and we are in danger of not being able to move forward with some of our funding we need you to you to help keep moving our grassroots organizing forward we currently are running our end of the year fundraising drive in order to continue to support our chapters and projects any contribution tax deductible would be tremendously appreciated and goes directly to funding sex workerled organizing

1,you did it you kept hope alive outstanding to celebrate of kindness free w purchase plenty of seats still available on the right side of history train thing is it leaves the station when the polls close tuesday until then you can still be one of americas good guys not comfortable with his latest racebased immigration fears dont let history lump you in with the white hoods and robes crowd history has its eyes on all of us and history remembers an d keep in mind history doesnt play fair where we have only some of the information by the time the history of this time gets told history will have all the details and more history will have the mueller report in its full unredacted sweetness history will know every step along the way from his campaigns first contact with the russian spies right up to him freely quoting the stolen emails on the campaign stage history will even have his tax returns how is that even fair but as much as history will have all the info at this point we really arent missing that much does each and every dot along the way need to be fully penciled in before we admit the obvious line between that first meeting and the knowing use of russianhacked documents on the campaign trail at this point does anyone think he is keeping his tax returns hidden out of a sense of humility in time every detail will be documented but right here right now we are already well past the reasonable doubt stage the right side of history train is blowing its final boarding call whistle allaboard and despite the purposefully crafted fears to the otherwise no hate here we really are ready to welcome in all late comers with kindness and appreciation and did i mention we have cookies see recipe below that this train exists at all much less that it is already rolling under a full head of steam is something incredibly worth celebrating everybody in this country owes a debt to all those who gave so much of themselves for these past two years to keep alive the hope that is at the heart of the american spirit from the very first full day in office with the womens march to those who will spend monday knocking on doors to get out the vote there are so many owed so much thanks so until the end of day saturday we are offering a value hope and kindness gift box that has our embrace hope pin kind pin heal the world bumperrefrigerator magnet and halfcup jar

be about and are a great introduction to penzeys no coupon or code is needed and they come in four colors to see them click here and theres good reason we were ready for this ready the day after the inauguration to start handing out tens of thousands of kind heart pins and embrace hope stickers the same forces of unlimited political spending that brought all this to the nation in first started a trial version in our home state of wisconsin in we were targeted for our outstanding public schools and universities and also for our leadership in environmental protection what theyve done hasnt been pretty but along the way weve learned a few things here is wisconsin it began with whats best described as a blitzkrieg attack on our states teachers it was well planned well funded and it was all about breaking the teachers spirits for a while it worked the inhumanity of using their media to turn teachers into villains in the eyes of the people of wisconsin simply to reward the governors benefactors with tax cuts was too much for us the center of the attack was the states largest school district here in milwaukee the first inservice day of back to school that fall we had a newlycreated teach gift box on every teachers and support staffs desk in total in it along with two spices were a teachers care bumper sticker a teach pin and a page teach mini cook booklet somehow it helped ive had mps teachers tell me it had gotten to the point where they did not want to go out in public for fear of being asked what they did for a living with all the right wing hate being directed at them am radio talkers really are like cancer to everything good in our area and as much as this opened our eyes to the power of pins and as good as the spices were and i still see the original teachers care bumper stickers ultimately it was the booklet that turned the tide in the face of the inhumanity being directed at the teachers by simply showing the humanity of teachers and their kindness the bubble of hate towards them burst it was an eyeopener so we were ready for the womens march january i dont know if any of us understand just how much every american owes to those who participated in the womens march all the damage done here in wisconsin everything we are still trying to dig out from was accomplished because they had us convinced they were popular and had the will of the people the outpouring of humanity that was the womens march dwarfed the inauguration crowds the previous day he lied so hard about that because he needed it to set in motion all he wanted to do but the myth of popular support never left the ground the history books should teach like dday its that important so its two years later and thanks to everyone who marched on january and everyone whos pitched in since hope is still alive and thats a reason to celebrate stop into our store for your hope and kindness box and if you havent already jump on the right side of history train before it leaves this coming tuesday vote vote vote oh yeah cookies for grandma moogs gingersnaps click here chuggachugga whoowhoo bill penzey billpenzeyscom with the extra hurdles our posts face because of our political belief that cooking is what happens when you care about people your liking this post and liking our fb page really help leaving a comment helps the most with just three more

1,"the world is still producing roughly

of its annual carbon dioxide co2 emissions with nearly everyone staying home

1,the total and complete heartbreak of not being able to save them all on friday sept st at am animal control employees arrived to work at the carsonlos angeles county animal shelter they found two cocker spaniels that had been tied up to the gate of the shelter parking lot both dogs clearly had been outdoor dogs matted dirty but one dog was emaciated and very weak the municipal animal shelters are not set up to operate as animal hospitals the shelter sent the sickly dog to an outside vet to get a more thorough exam camp cocker rescue had driven more than two hours one way to the carson shelter that same day to meet both dogs and get our name on them so that we could have first chance to get them once their stray hold was up we didnt get to meet the sickly cocker because he was already sent out to a private vet later on that day the shelter phoned us to say that the sickly dog had to be euthanized because he was suffering and was in a state of crisis we learned after he had been euthanized that the private vet had said he was flea infested and severely anemic and the only way to save his life would have been a blood transfusion this was crushing news to us because we would have taken him to a specialty hospital to get a blood transfusion and attempted to save his life he was on a stray hold though and legally the shelter was in a grey area if they had released the dog to us that was still on stray hold and we had done major medical treatments on him to save his life the owners could have come forward to claim the dog and we would have been forced to return him that is always a gamble in these situations but we wish that the shelter had thought to call us and give us that option we spoke to one of the supervisors there and asked them to please let all of the staff know that in the future if there is ever a cocker spaniel that they are considering euthanizing due to major medical to please call us asap because we want to have the chance to step in in the shelter is defense they are dealing with situations like this all of the time they are not set up to triage animals like an emergency animal hospital and this shelter is in a more low income area so it is common to see animals turn up at the shelter that are in dire need of medical care the whole thing was heartbreaking absolutely heartbreaking we were able to rescue the other dog and his new name is now pumpkin pumpkin is the dog on the left his friend is the emaciated dog on the right pumpkin is a skittish shy dog and this confirms our hunch that these were someone is backyard dogs that were never socialized or vetted or cared for in any way in honor of pumpkin is friend whom we never met we would like to posthumously honor him by giving him a nice name and including his picture on our calendar for next year we have a rainbow bridge section where he will be featured would you like to make a small donation today in honor of pumpkin is friend and also contribute some name suggestions we will be putting them all in a jar and pulling a name out so he can have the dignity of a name and a place in our calendar to remember him by donations can be made directly here on this special donate link there is a place to enter your name suggestions on that link

1,"a year ago today it was confirmed that the liberal democrats had won control of the new somerset west  taunton council
this came after the merger of the two previous conservativeled councils taunton deane borough council and west somerset council
we won 3059 seats two subsequent byelections later saw us increase our majority to 32
the beginning was rocky as we found a new council struggling to cope weve spent a lot of the first year steadying the boat but this hasnt stopped us from making many positive steps from starting the coal orchard regeneration in taunton to building a new industry site in minehead for a local employer whilst having to deal with other immediate matters from repairing the stormdamaged sea wall at watchet to continuing to invest in staff to improve the services we provide
unfortunately the current crisis has obviously changed our priorities for a while but we are still trying to keep other exciting projects on track from finally commencing the construction of the firepool redevelopment in taunton this year to other projects such as supporting the progress of a new train station in wellington or the construction and purchasing of new council homes in the district
it is often been tough but we are proud of what we have achieved so far and will achieve much more whilst maintaining the importance of the climate emergency
here is a list of a number of our achievements from february  wwwtdldcouknewsstories2020225swtsfirstbudget

1,"today on international workers day 2020 may 1  a new release the reality show ep is out
when the market is needed at its best is when it is working at its worst said stefan ingves governor of the central bank of sweden perhaps this is why the capital in crisis suddenly wants the state to interfere in their business of course only by pumping money into the capital and thus prop up the capital when business returns to its normal state the state also should go back to its passive role the money given by the state has by then disappeared in form of dividends to the capital owners
others might say the crises is a clear sign of the inherent divergence in capitalism for those who do not see the development towards the apocalypse in the shape of climate change and increasing class differences as proof enough
but in the absence of revolution and socialism the crises will only lead further in the monopolization of the capital that is companies will go under and the remaining will be larger and fewer

at carbon calculator we believe knowledge is power knowing approximately how much carbon is released in the manufacture shipping and selling of items will help make us more conscious consumers picking to buy used where possible reusing more of what we already have and recycling the things we can no longer use
about carbon calculator is estimates
carbon calculator looks at a product listing and attempts to match the product category to a north american industry classification system naics category if a match is made carbon calculator can use publicly available estimates of the carbon intensity of the naics category to make a fairly precise estimate of the carbon footprint of the item if carbon calculator is unable to find the naics category we will still make an estimate but it will be less accurate
what is coe
coe or carbon dioxide equivalent is a standard unit for measuring a carbon footprint this metric takes into account greenhouse gases ghg such as carbon dioxide methane nitrous oxide and more while co is the most common green house gas other ghgs are far more harmful for the environment coe describes the different greenhouse gases as a single unit with each green house gas converted to its co equivalent ex kg of methane kg of carbon dioxide

1,"namaste my name is rammi im an english literature graduate from bihar currently im residing in noida with my family
compassion towards all living beings became an integral part of my existence since early childhood however i do not remember my age back then but i clearly remember the incident it is the 9th day of dusshera and sacrificing a goat mostly baby goat was a ritual he came to our home 45 days early and we became friends we used to play with him all the time and all of a sudden on the 8th day he got sad wasnt eating or playing i asked my mom and she told that they also get the feeling of death that is why he is like this on asking why the answer was tradition at that tender age i understood that tradition should not be a reason to justify such an act
though my mother says i have never eaten meat in my childhood which i do not clearly recall but i do remember that after this incident i never ate sadly i couldnt escape from conditioning and continued to consume dairy products
i became familiar with peta when i was in my 10th std and got to know about movements that were happening for animal welfare and rights due to the lack of internet and access to more information about it the whole activism part went down to my subconscious and it took me almost 16 years to awaken
it is january 2018 when a friend of mine told me that he is going vegan he used to call me a grass eater having a conversation with him about veganism made me realise that i was living a life of hypocrites on one hand i was talking about not eating animals and on the other hand i was exploiting them for their baby is milk it was an overnight change for me without any transitioning period as far as alternatives to dairy products are concerned there are multiple options out there in the market there are tons of recipes available online you just have to take that first step
once you know and see the truth you cant go back close your eyes and pretend nothing is happening though my husband was furious about this change because he had to change his lifestyle from a meateater to a vegetarian after getting married but he understood after i gave him an explanation and now he too is a transitioning vegan parents and some wellwishers called and asked by whom i got influenced and why did i take such big decision i explained the facts to them some of them understood and some of them laughed it affects me badly when people laugh or make jokes about it and they still do but i learned to be more patient
i always believed in raising a voice for what you believe after meeting raghav a vegan activist from delhi i got to know about activism and joined their group if we would not speak for those innocent animals then who will
it doesnt mean i ask everyone to come on the streets and do activism being a vegan is activism in itself anyone who is a vegan has their own struggle it can be in their homes workplaces or with friends but do speak about it pass the information you have let them choose what they want to do with it
as individuals we talk a lot about climate change pollution etc and about suggesting governments to make many changes in the legal system but when the time comes for us to take action we tend to get defensive and indulge ourselves in arguments if we could act more and talk less we can help the animals and ourselves too thank you"

1,money donated to hsus is used to train law enforcement and to meddle in environmental issues law enforcement agencies are being influenced by animal rights groups animal rights groups have become an influence on law enforcement not only through award ceremonies for example handing out humane law enforcement awards but through training as well the humane society of the united states hsus has provided many states cities and counties with material and workshops about how to enforce animal laws and conduct seizures then after the workshops they have awarded outstanding officers and departments for their efforts this animal rights influence on law enforcement is a justifiable cause for worry amongst people who own animals the hsus has been known to take extreme measures to end all animal ownership and production they have also been known to participate in seizures and use those seizures raise considerable funds to pad their coffers therefore with law enforcement receiving training and encouragement by animal rights extremists animal rights groups are one step closer to achieving their goal of ending animal ownership training sessions offered by hsus to law enforcement the humane society of the united states training sessions for various law enforcement officers covers the following background on animal fighting and illegal animal abuse including relevant laws the unproven claim that animal abuse leads to other violent crimes investigating cruelty complaints from first response to filing charges recognizing key evidence warrants and statements most of these trainings are free to law enforcement departments trainers are former and current officers that have an expertise in finding the loopholes in animal protection laws that can be used against animal owners they also have expertise in conducting seizures the hsus website claims the animal rescue team has a long and successful track record with prosecutors judges and law enforcement law enforcement agencies across the country call upon us to assist with the investigation and prosecution of every type of animal abuse training of north dakota law enforcement often when people hear about the hsus inserting themselves into law enforcement they dismiss it thinking it doesnt impact them and that it will never happen in our agricultural state it does happen and in fact the hsus targets states and communities where they believe they can slip in without much opposition what happened in north dakota is a prime example the hsus pushed a ballot initiative in north dakota titled prevention of animal cruelty in hopes of making voters believe they were helping animals voters did not fall for the misleading legislation and voted down the initiative however the hsus was not deterred via back door methods they were able to make changes to the century code and passed similar laws as outlined in their ballot initiative despite the will of the people then they proceeded to train law enforcement on the new law which allows for an actionable claim from out of state callers and the seizure and sale of animals without notice to the owner or hearing to establish guilt or wrongdoing but thats not all hsus asserts itself in environmental issues sealions the hsus meddles in the ecosystem with their lawsuits against removal of sea lions at the bonneville dam they have filed lawsuits against the us department of fish and wildlife multiple times creating issues with populations of salmon steelhead white sturgeon and orca their agenda is selfish as they are choosing one species and disregarding many others who are at risk of becoming endangered or are already endangered wild horses the hsus has been known for its farreaching tentacles this is proven in their activities around horses on american rangelands the hsus had teamed up with wild horse extremistactivist groups to file lawsuits and to stop the blm from being able to properly manage the horse populations what most people dont know is that the hsus has a patent on pzp a birth control vaccine therefore the hsus isnt concerned about the wild horse population as much as they are worried about their own finances environmental police awarded by humane society on july th in massachusetts environmental police officer major patrick moran as well as the board of wildlife violator compact administrators were honored by the humane society of the united states with the humane law enforcement award environmental police are otherwise known as game wardens in massachusetts and team up with other state agencies as a part of the environmental crimes strike force according to the massgov website the environmental crimes strike force investigates and prosecutes crimes that harm the state is air land or water or that pose a significant threat to human health the strike force is an interagency team that includes prosecutors from the attorney general is office officers from the massachusetts environmental police and investigators engineers and attorneys from the massachusetts department of environmental protection dep misleading the public these agencies teaming up with hsus are worrisome considering the power they have in their respective communities they certainly are misleading the public about where their money goes when they run ads about shelter animals on television

1,ok folks it is election time once again right up front i am begging anyone that reads this to share it share it everywhere we need this to go viral i know that you have heard this stuff about how important this midterm election is but please hear me out the special counsel is busy with his massive investigation of election fraud and it is has been over a year since it started republicans have been screaming and whining that it is taking too long despite the fact that investigations of this nature are notoriously complex and long lasting in fact this particular investigation is like warp when compared to special counsel investigations from the past where they run at mph but the problem is that even if he reveals that trump has conspired with russia to throw the election toward him even if he did violate election finance law by paying off famous women of the sex industry porn stars and models to hush about his toadstool affairs even if he did sexually assault someone even if he lies to everyone about everything evades taxes fleeces the us government through his excessive golf trips to his own resorts violates the emoluments clause of the us constitution andor breaks the law in some way that i havens thought of or remember trump is going to have the support of ignorant backwoods half toothless morons that barely have an elementary understanding of civics remember they also have the right to vote trump has abused the power of the presidency we all know this he is also one of two presidents that have lost the popular vote and have collectively appointed judges that do not represent the majority of the people to the supreme court republicans have had the entire government in their control for going on years and have done mostly nothing for the majority of the people what they have done is taken every step possible to thwart an independent investigation into the administration that has been underway since trump has been in office they have done everything in their power to strongarm the judicial appointment process ryan mcconnell grassley nunes gowdy and any other republican official that has anything to do with enabling this erosion of the american government should be removed from office this election is not just a typical midterm election it is putting an emergency brake on this administrations abuse of power it is taking our country back from the oligarchs that use their money that they made on our backs to buy our government out from under us it is one of the primary reasons that our country was founded in the first place we pay taxes and we are not adequately represented our voices are not heard in this republican vacuum big corporations are drowning out our voices by spending massive amounts of money to legally bribe our representatives they dont have the accountability of citizenship or the right to vote but they have an unreasonable amount of influence in our elections allowing republicans to run our government has proven to be a colossal screw up of nearly biblical proportions it is literally the most important one in my lifetime so make sure that you vote

1,an advertisement paid for by my political action committee on the topic of female genital mutilationcutting fgmc has evoked strong reactions from the local community like many mainers i was horrified to learn that maine has hundreds of little girls at risk of this cultural practice along with many democrats i supported bipartisan legislation that would have helped maine prohibit this form of child abuse to help send a strong message of solidarity with other states and the global community to end fgm just a few months ago new hampshire became the th state to criminalize female genital mutilation with unanimous support many organizations including unicef the aha foundation and the world health organization support eliminating fgm the united nations also calls for zero tolerance of fgmc while there is a federal law that prohibits cutting there are loop holes that leave thousands of girls across the country at risk and it forces a crime committed against a maine citizen to rely on federal prosecution that is why the maine prosecutors association testified the eight elected da s make up the executive directors of the maine prosecutors association we are democrats and republicans and we are in support of ld the prosecutors do not feel confident that they can charge someone with committing female genital mutilation without the passage of this bill why there are two main reasons while female genital mutilation is a barbaric disfiguration bearing no resemblance to male circumcision there are prosecutors that argue that it is not aggravated assault when the parents and children consent the prosecutors would like clear guidance from this committee as to whether or not you want this mutilation charged as a crime clear statues without guess work are important if you want state prosecutions yes it is already illegal federally but the da offices try by far the most criminal cases in maine the law court held in state v kargar ad me that a picture of a man with his son is penis in his mouth did not constitute sexual assault there is a debate among prosecutors as to whether a similar analysis could be used by the law court to overturn a female genital mutilation assault conviction again clarity from this committee would be extremely helpful there is speculation on whether the crime is happening in maine or not here is what we know maine is one of only states in the country to receive a special federal grant targeting fgmc year medicaid mainecare billing receipts show fgm has been treated every year since maine access immigrant networkmain the recipient of the federal grant has issued a report stating sixteen percent of providers most from portland and lewiston reported that between and of the patients they saw in the last year had experienced fgmc the population reference bureau has identified females at high risk in maine other states have criminalized fgmc antfgm legislation is about protecting young girls with a clear law that serves as a deterrent and if a crime occurs as justice for the victim fgm is a cultural issue and not a racial or religious issue it is practiced by people of many faiths and it predates islam by centuries as a state representative i placed the ad to highlight attention to this issue on behalf of frustrated constituents as the result of submitted letters that have been stymied or repeatedly denied publication after days of review this paper accepted the ad and they willingly accepted payment interestingly the paper is editor wrote a biased rebuttal in the same edition of the paper thus proving knowledge in advance courier publications seems to be holding a personal grudge because of my interview policy after repeatedly being misquoted and grossly misrepresented i am now happy to answer questions in writing purposefully fomenting community anger should never be a goal of any newspaper the purpose of the ad was to bring awareness to this horrid crime and to inform the voters that maine house democrats views on this issue put party politics before protecting vulnerable girls and they are not in alignment with the maine senate other democrats other states the global community the governor the us congress the list goes on i have succeeded to be clear democrat senator dave miramant voted in favor of this bill and that sarah gideon democrat speaker of the house was an original sponsor of the antifgm bill the question people should ask is why would speaker gideon change course and lead the house democrats to oppose legislation that is passed with unanimous support from the maine senate and so many other states i suspect this conversation will be ongoing and my sincere hope is that we will be able to pass meaningful antifgm legislation in the upcoming legislative session paid for and authorized by women is leadership fund pac pob warren me the top three funders of the women is leadership fund are the eastern horizons llc revive hometown maine pac maine republican party not paid for by any candidate

1,he died his soul had left his body the last moments of his life were being replayed in his head over and over again until darkness absorbed them there was nothing but darkness the hero of the underground ring was stabbed to death by the one to whom he had entrusted his heart he was capable of winning even the most difficult fights but couldnt defend himself against his beloved he could no longer see or hear or feel he couldnt be for some reason he was still aware of himself his past and even his personality the only thing he had forgotten was his name it seemed to him that he had never had one but his memories claimed otherwise he had no idea how much time he had spent in that darkness maybe an hour maybe a day a year or perhaps even an eternity it couldve even been a single moment time didnt exist there gradually something began to change and he felt distinctly alive like a newborn he became suddenly aware of his existence he opened his eyes at least he tried to open them his left eyelid was swollen and it wouldnt move but he managed to open his right one with a lot of effort at first everything was blurry but after a while his vision became a little clearer the man saw endless wide skies spread above him was a clean and calm ocean of blue there wasnt a single cloud only a majestic light his hearing came back right after his vision it happened rather abruptly the man heard a stream gurgling somewhere nearby carrying muffled voices next came the sense of smell the pungent aroma of sewage and feces hung in the air at the same moment he tasted something bitter that reminded him of metal there was blood in his mouth the last to recover was the sense of touch the man finally felt his own body hands legs torso head it all seemed so unusual after his soul had spent some time in the darkness a forgotten feeling he didnt want to move and even if he had tried the pain wouldve impaled him on the spot even lying motionless the man felt his hands burning with pain and blood oozing from the wound on his leg water mixed with blood was touching his skin making it sting and itch his breathing was weak and irregular and his chest hurt the man had no desire to do anything looking at the endless skies with one halfopen eye he reflected he was thinking about why he was here why had life given him another chance what for pain his soul couldnt find peace even after death how sad then his memories started coming back someone else is memories began to merge with his memories of the previous owner of the body he had found himself in he too had recently died allowing him to be reborn his story was also a tragic one he was only fourteen when he was mutilated killed and thrown into a ditch because of a petty theft he had committed so as not to die of hunger his family had moved to this city not long before that event occurred an epidemic broke out the nature and origins of which remained unknown annihilating almost a tenth of the local population his parents had died a year earlier and left him a small shack and some money he wouldve continued to live on but he was unfortunate enough to have come across a member of one of the city is ruling families broken hands and death were an unjust punishment strange how the man wasnt at all bothered by that right now there was no anger or hatred in him only boundless apathy and a drop of incomprehensible joy the man finally remembered a name it wasnt his however no it belonged to the previous owner but it was still a name his name was kai kai arnhard for some reason he was quite pleased with this suddenly kai was filled with a strange sensation and incomprehensible lines of text showed up before his eyes surprising him life and emotional activity discovered canceling uninstall system restoring the structure resuming work the system has been restored and is ready for use test opening of the options menu to check the mind of the carrier stats age race human status mortal stage none level none characteristics power speed endurance stamina mind energy abilities none paths unknown what is this a thought flashed through his shocked mind having regained focus he managed to dig out the memories that might hold answers to his questions as it turned out everyone in this world had such a system kai had no doubts that he was now a part of a completely different world and that he was no longer on earth however he wasnt sure how much martial arts masters like him were worth here the system appeared in people at the moment of their birth and remained there until they died apparently having considered kai dead it began uninstalling itself but the presence of another soul stopped it only one thing remained unclear how and why did he enter the corpse and for what reason had the system started functioning again what had stimulated it the past kai knew little about it as he was from a poor and illiterate family but the new kai who had lived on earth for a long time guessed that it was something like a neural interface a computer placed in a person is brain that millions of people from his world could only dream about the little knowledge that the past kai did have he had gained from the general information window of the system and rumors that he had heard from his parents as the present kai understood it the system scanned the characteristics of the body at birth and displayed them in the brain in the form of numbers it performed the same action whenever any stat changed the system was constantly monitoring them they were calculated in relation to the average value of the physical abilities of a twentyyearold human with a score of one being equivalent to that value kai is stats were extremely low right now even for his age the reason behind it was his crippled and beatenup body present kai reread the information window not wanting to rely only on past kai is memories power was responsible for all manifestations of physical strength and speed for the speed of muscle contraction transmission of neural signals throughout the body and even thinking endurance was selfexplanatory and the system information only confirmed the present kai is assumptions the next characteristic stamina determined one is resistance to various injuries and the ability to recover from them that is to regenerate weirdly though the mind which by logic shouldve been pretty low he had never considered himself smart was almost doubled mind reflected all intellectual and mental abilities kai assumed that this characteristic had such a high value due to social reasons since there were no official educational institutions in this world there werent as many literate people here as there were on earth therefore in comparison to the local majority he was highly developed in this regard despite being in the body of a fourteenyearold boy at least he wasnt a complete loser the last characteristic displayed the amount of energy that could be used to perform various techniques in this world techniques were special abilities that allowed a person to use magic called martial arts it could be said that in this case the word technique was a synonym for the word spell kai suddenly felt weak he shouldnt have survived but since he had he shouldnt have remained conscious the mysterious force that remained with him after his soul had moved into the new body kept him alert only for ten minutes consciousness was slipping away from him and kai found himself floating in the darkness once more in the meantime in one of the alleys where people were rarely seen about feet away from a wounded man stood two figures a pretty girl of about eighteen was marching down the alley her thick brown hair was pulled back into a tight ponytail and her warm amber eyes were sparkling despite her graceful form her dress was rather plain she was holding the wrinkled hand of a grayhaired old man in spite of his age he kept his back straight and didnt lag behind his granddaughter time seemed to have had no power over him dressed in a long robe that only healers were allowed to wear he calmly walked forward grandpa i swear the girl said with concern you have to see it the resemblance is uncanny so what he asked in a deep voice you must understand julie that the past cant be changed i beg you just take a look she cried the old man only sighed after a couple of minutes they reached the illfated alley with a gutter what the old man saw made him freeze bitter sorrow filled his heart right there among the garbage and sewage lay a boy who was the spitting image of a person close to him of his grandson a grandson who had disappeared more than a year ago it cant be the old man whispered not believing his eyes i told you julie said unable to hold back tears could it be that he managed to return the old man was silent it was difficult for him a wise old man to believe in miracles the old man was silent it was difficult for him a wise old man to believe in miracles that is the old man fell silent having gotten closer julie was finally able to examine the boy her heart sank when she saw his wounds and broken hands sobbing she fell to her knees grandpa julie had no doubt that this was her younger brother she refused to believe that the heavens couldnt hear her and that she wouldnt be rewarded for months of suffering she wanted to believe that her missing brother had been saved having noticed the change in his granddaughter the old man quickly leaned forward and assessed the boy is injuries a doctor is temperament as well as the hope that this truly was his grandson didnt allow him to just stand by idly and watch grab his shoulders careful he began to instruct julie we need to get him to our clinic as soon as possible i do not know who has done this to him but if we do not act quickly he would not survive julie who had been helping her grandfather all her life quickly did as she was told with no hesitation she grabbed the boy under the armpits as carefully as possible the old man took the boy is legs and they lifted him together having quickly and carefully brought him to the clinic which was a part of their house they laid him on the bed removing and throwing away his dirty clothes having washed the boy the old man began treating him check out this novel on amazon httpwwwamazoncomdpbscs

1,"fidel castro spoke truth to power in this 1979 speech to the united nations here translated into english when he lambasted the wealthy countries present for not doing enough to support the poorest and most vulnerable people and nations of the world
in his fiery oration castro evoked the spirit of the world is poor when he demanded less talk and more action to provide concrete economic programs to ensure that no one on earth is without food shelter or an education
the speculative new global economic order which castro derided is no longer a speculation the globalized neoliberal economy is now a fact of reality the world health organisation has reported that in the present day 821 million or 1 in 9 people on earth now experience hunger 151 million children under 5 being are malnourished and not growing to their full potential
the un has acknowledged that little progress is being made in the present day to tackle these problems were he still with us fidel might as so what is new these problems are only getting worse due to climate change and the increasing occurrence of extreme temperature anomalies it is a fact that there is enough food and enough wealth on earth to feed clothe shelter and educate every single human being fidel and other marxists around the world recognised that this is not the way it has to be hunger and poverty are manmade problems based on profit margins and bank balances
fidel castro ended his speech with a plea to world leaders to pursue peaceful means to resolve differences the shadow of nuclear war loomed over the world and is present to this day
what is the purpose of human consciousness what is the purpose of human life what will secure our species survival castro posits that is is only through economic equality cooperation over competition global solidarity and pursuit of peace that we will find our purpose and survive

myself in a park with my best friend evan we did not go to that park that day to murder craig sorger it was just another day in my average life until evan pulled a knife out of his pocket and told me he wanted to go on a killing spree at first i thought he w as just making a sick joke surely he wasnt serious but i soon found myself following him to a nearby travel trailer where year old craig

when my average life changed forever evan asked craig to touch the ground for seconds craig got on the ground and began counting at evan dropped a rock on the back of craig is neck knocking him to the ground i got up and tried to stop evan i said stop evan got off craig and pushed me to the ground i stayed there and watched evan began hitting craig more than times several times craig tried to get away but evan repeatedly pulled him back to the ground and continued to strike him i did not see anything in evan is hand but he was stabbing craig to death i look back and i wish that i would have done something to rescue craig it is one reason i now do everything in my power to rescue the preborn from the slaughter the attack lasted minutes after which craig remained motionless on the ground i then picked up a stick and was going to hit evan but he had a terrifying look in his eyes i was afraid that i was the next in his killing spree so i braced the stick walked past evan and struck craig in the head and legs before throwing the stick to the ground evan said nothing he walked to me and he shook my hand days later we were arrested for st degree murder and held on million dollar bail we spent months proclaiming our innocence first saying that we had seen craig walking towards home from the park we later said craig had fallen from a tree we were tried as adults becoming the youngest defendants tried as adults in washington state history a year would pass before i broke down and finally told the truth about what happened i would plead guilty of nd degree murder by complicity and sentenced to years after my sentencing a journalist asked me if i was angry i received a years sentence i said no i deserved worse the next day i was transferred to prison my time in prison started badly i spent the majority of my time in solitary confinement for fighting i was locked into a by foot cell for hours per day where the lights were on all the time there were no windows in my cell to let in light my only view was the window in the cell door that looked out onto a sterile cellblock when i was allowed out for one hour of recreation per day i would first be stripsearched then i would be shackled hand and feet and taken by two guards to a small brick cage that was my exercise yard i was not allowed to talk to the guards or to the other prisoners i would then be shackled again and led back to my cell all meals were served to me through a slot in my cell door i lived like this year after year after year the only positive that came from all those years in solitary confinement was that i taught myself how to read and write i spent all of my time reading book after book i must have read thousands of books those years in solitary confinement must have also taught me a lesson because i stayed out of trouble for the rest of my sentence for the years i spent in prison there was only one thing i looked forward to visits from my best friend marissa we had been friends since we were years old our fathers worked together and she had served as my character witness at my trial she attended my sentencing hearing we exchanged hundreds of letters over last decade i spent in prison and years before i was released we fell in love in three months before my sentence was up i escaped i fled my work release program in yakima wa and hitchhiked miles to idaho from there i jumped on a bus to south dakota where us marshals captured my at gun point at a rapid city bus stop looking back now i was simply overwhelmed by the responsibilities of work release after living my entire life behind bars i served out the rest of my sentence in state prison before being transferred to county jail to be charged with st degree escape i faced more years in prison i found myself on the top floor of one of the worst county jails in the country the first day i witnessed a man murdered by other prisoners it was in this environment that god began to work on me in my jail cell i found books the bible the journals of jim elliot and eric metaxas biography on detrich bonhoeffer this last book sparked my interest in reading the bible i was impressed by bonhoeffer is bold stand against the nazi holocaust in my cell i began to read the bible every hour that i was awake i was reading it i would spend five six hours reading then fall asleep wake up and begin reading from where i left off on january th i remember falling on my knees and calling out to god to save me i know that we are saved by repentance and faith but at the point of conversion all i knew was that god loved me and i was saved i remember getting up from the floor of my jail cell and it was like the old jake eakin stayed there dead and a new jake eakin rose from the dead and i knew that nothing would ever be the same again the grace of god found me on the floor of a jail cell he met me there and and changed me forever i was born again i realize that i was not worthy of the grace that i had been given i was a murderer and i deserved nothing but death and hell but by the grace of god i was alive and i wanted to spend the rest of my life obeying the call of my king with every breath of grace i had in my lungs i hope my testimony sheds light on the truth of the gospel and it is power to save the worst sinners no sin is too deep that god is amazing grace cannot reach we serve a mighty god who can take murderers and transform them into instruments to advance his kingdom paul was a zealous murderer out for christian blood before god used him to save thousands we serve a god who can save repentant murderers when i was released in february i briefly moved in with my family within months i married marissa but i remember feeling adrift not sure what god wanted me to do with my life a few weeks before my wedding while sitting on a coach with marissa i saw a youtube video that stopped me in my tracks it was of rusty thomas the national director of operation save america staging a rescue outside an abortion clinic in louisville kentucky at one point in the video rusty thomas was sitting on the sidewalk in handcuffs and he turned to his son jeremiah thomas and told him son this is your heritage something about the look on jeremiah is face broke my heart for the preborn children being murdered through abortion i had never even thought about abortion before that moment but i felt the lord move on me and break my heart for the preborn it changed my life forever all glory to god for what he has done in my life i have nothing good in myself i am a redeemed murderer deserving of death and hellfire but god chose to radically change me if god can save me then no one is beyond his power to save

1,i didnt wear seat belts growing up and i lived but that doesnt make it a solid parenting practice respectfully its time for us to grow out of the limiting belief that spanking is acceptable because i was spanked and i turned out fine perhaps you did though not because you were spanked but in spite of its true that not every child who was spanked will turn out badly its also true that some children who were never spanked will not turn out fine but anecdotal evidence aside scientific research clearly shows the likelihood of negative outcomes increases when youve been spanked as a child we cant always see these outcomes in the moment just as we cant see our children growing taller on a daily basis to claim spanking a child is fine because we turned out fine often means we are falling victim to three pitfalls in our thinking that come along with anecdotal evidence namely dismissing all broader data to the contrary dismissing alternate views and failing to learn and progress by engaging with a challenging idea if you are pro spanking i ask that before you reply you sit with the data and the reality that pediatricians and psychologists around the world are clear spanking is harmful says kazdin who served as apa president in there is no need for corporal punishment based on the research we are not giving up an effective technique we are saying this is a horrible thing that does not work grow past spanking it can be challenging when it was the only form of discipline modeled for us but with tools and support it is possible for more on the science behind this share

1,"why buy furniture that is built locally
one reason is because it is green a more environmentally friendly choice
100 of eastwood is furniture is sourced from woodworking  metal shops within 60 miles of our stores
compare that to mass manufacturing where they are shipping heavy furnishings and raw materials across oceans and continents sometimes even the wood is forested from one continent  shipped to another for manufacturing
and picture the amount of packing materials used just to keep all that massproduced furniture safe in transit to the us
the way we do it there is much less fuel used so the carbon footprint is minuscule
the solid wood we build with is from ohio and a couple surrounding states
and all of the sawmills near us source from sustainable forests that replant more than they harvest
even our reclaimed barn wood is sourced from obsolete farming structures in our area
there is an organization sustainable furnishing council that is working towards an industry that has a minimal impact on our environment to combat climate change
their vision is to have a locally based industry where all furniture is sourced within 300 miles of the consumer
eastwood is already there

1,hello my name is ami dar i am the founder of idealistorg and i want to tell you a story i want to share this because i suspect that in your own life youve faced similar situations and if you have i believe that together we can change the world starting right now i was born in jerusalem and raised mostly in peru and in mexico when i was my family moved back to israel and at i was drafted into the israeli army for three years of compulsory service a year lat er my unit was stationed on the syrian border and my job was to spend several hours each day alone on a watchtower looking through a telescope across the barbed wire and the minefields trying to spot any strange movements on the other side one afternooni remember it was a cool beautiful winter dayi suddenly had a thought that made me laugh out loud i laughed because the idea was childish but also true in that way that children have of recognizing the truth a few months earlier getting to know the guys in my unit id realized gratefully that some of them would give me their last pair of dry socks if i ever needed them but there were also a few who might steal mine if i wasnt careful that image was on my mind that afternoon when through the telescope i saw a group of syrian soldiers playing a game of soccer across the valley that separated us and instantly something about the situationthat moment of play their running around like kidshumanized them in my eyes in a way that was entirely new and fresh and different when you grow up in a conflict zone or in any fragmented society it is natural for each side to dehumanize the other but if that filter shatters you can never go back and the moment their full humanity struck me i had that crazy thought that changed my life wait a minute wait a minute i thought if in my unit and in every other unit i know there are some guys id trust with my life and others id rather stay away from then in that unit this must also be the case and if that is true then this whole border fence is running the wrong way instead of syrians on one side and israelis on the other wouldnt it make more sense for the socksharers on both sides to get together and that is when i laughed i laughed yet this idea stayed with me and still haunts me now since then ive learned that life is more complicated and that the line between good and bad runs within each of us and yet i cant help noticing that all over the world behind every label and stereotype there are people who share some basic values and i cant help thinking that if these people could somehow work together the world would be a very different place what are these values treating others the way wed like to be treated is a good start but we can go beyond that for example i believe that in every country and every culture there are many people who would agree with this sentence working with others in a spirit of generosity and mutual respect i want to help build a world where all people can lead free and dignified lives and more i believe that many of these people would be happy to work together on the single biggest challenge we all share closing the gap that exists everywhere between our good intentions and the actions we actually take if you are still with me you know what i mean every day many of us would like to respond in some way to what is happening around us but for a variety of reasons we do not we may feel that we have no time no resources no power or no impact we may not know where to start what to do or who to work with we may be afraid of failure ridicule meetings and committees wasting our time getting depressed this list could go on but the point is that this challengeor opportunityis huge think how many times youve felt this way now multiply that by every person whod recognize this feeling and we are talking about millions of missed opportunities for action and collaboration every day now imagine a different world imagine if these peoplethe socksharers the practical dreamers the twenty people youd take with you if you had to spend a couple of years on a desert island imagine if these people could easily connect across all the lines that divide us imagine usyou me and everyone who wants to join us doing whatever it takes to make it easier for people everywhere to move from intention to action imagine using every available toolfrom mobile apps to a bulletin board on a village treeto match needs ideas and opportunities with people organizations and resources imagine reading the news and having an act button that would let us do something about what wed just read imagine if in addition to hotlines for emergencies we also had a hotline for projects and dreams imagine wherever you are that once a month on etc we organized idealist days that made it okay and more than okay to spark and celebrate action and possibility freedom and dignity imagine in brief that together we could narrow the gap between what is and what could be between what we know in our hearts to be possible and the reality we see around us we can do all this and we can do it now we just need to start but to start we need to know where we are going so here is the whole idea in a few words what do we want to change the world from the ground up how by closing the gap between intention and action yes but how by inviting people everywhere to imagine connect and act imagine a better world a better community and a better life connect with others and share ideas skills and resources act on our good intentions and help others to act on theirs who will make this happen the world is idealists idealists yes practical dreamers who want to help build a world where all people can lead free and dignified lives and they would promote and facilitate action and collaboration using every available means how do we start by seeing our shared humanity and then then we get organized plan the next idealist day and invite everyone around us to imagine connect and act and then day by day month by month we continue building a whole ecosystem of possibilitythat act button that hotline a good mobile app to wake up to in the morningso that no opportunity for action or collaboration is missed or wasted as we do all this well run into all kinds of challenges some of these will be tougher than others but the thing about us humans is that once we commit to a big goalin this case closing the gap between intention and actionwe are very good at figuring out how to get there wherever you are you can make this happen and together we can push the limits of what seems possible in our lives and in our communities how far let is find out if this invitation speaks to you please join us in this group and let is make this happen

according to media reports the prime minister is office ordered officials from global affairs canada to put pressure on former diplomat david mulroney who is now a teacher and researcher at the munk school at the university of toronto to have his public remarks on the trudeau government approved this pressure would be due to the electoral environment so that mr mulroney had to be very very careful
this is totally inappropriate and a blatant attempt by justin trudeau to muzzle a highly respected former career diplomat trudeau has demonstrated his tendency to silence those who speak freely
justin trudeau once said he admires china is grassroots dictatorship but that is not how it works in canada
it also raises questions about whether the prime minister is office has ordered government officials to speak with former ambassador to china and former trudeau cabinet minister john mccallum mccallum has made a number of inappropriate statements over the past year including about canada is extradition process and its encouragement of chinese foreign interference in the upcoming federal election
as mr mulroney said deterring citizens with foreign relations expertise from speaking freely is a fundamentally undemocratic concept i completely agree justin trudeau must be held accountable for the many occasions when he exploits canada is nonpartisan public service to serve his own political interests
justin trudeau had promised to do politics differently but it is clear that he is not what he announced"

1,how a dangerous slaughter bound horse was transformed into a faithful companion dear fellow fair horse owner id like to share a story with you it is the story of a woman and her horse and it was very nearly a tragedy i remember that day in particular because the scorching midjuly texas heat was in full effect setting a new historic high it was one of those days when the cows spent the entire day hiding in the shade of the nearby live oak trees to escape the heat not moving a muscle until the sun set i was putting on a steady horse clinic at my ranch and it had gone really well a lot of people made real breakthroughs in the way they communicated with their horses and i was pleased and felt proud of putting in a day is worth of hard work at the end of the clinic when everyone was packing up their trucks and getting ready to head home a woman approached me who i had never met before she had come with her friend who was participating in the clinic and i hadnt had a chance to talk with her well when she approached me to introduce herself i noticed immediately that one of her arms was in a sling she said her name was linda and that she wanted me to train her horse for her linda went on to tell me that her horse midnight was the love of her life she had rescued him as a skinny starving yearling and they had grown to love each other midnight was a quarter horse gelding and at the time was 5 years old like any new colt linda had sent him off to a trainer to get started the first time midnight came back from the trainer linda described it as a dream it felt like everything was going great until a few weeks later when midnight slowly stopped responding to her commands easy things like catching him and getting him to respect her space started becoming huge chores and full of drama so off she sent midnight to another trainer to fix him and the same thing happened he was perfect for a few weeks and then the bad habits started to rear their ugly heads again linda and midnight were back to fighting over the simplest problems and this time midnight was bucking randomly and without provocation over the years linda sent midnight to five different trainers went to over a dozen clinics but always got the same results just a few weeks before linda had gotten midnight back from a trainer out in north texas as usual he had behaved well after getting home but a week later she was out on a trail ride with a few friends out in a beautiful open pasture when the craziest thing happened out on the trail for no reason whatsoever midnight started bucking like crazy linda tried desperately to stay on him but it wasnt enough he threw her linda landed hard breaking her arm in two places but linda is arm wasnt the only thing broken in the fall her pride and confidence and trust in midnight had been shattered as well all she had wanted to do was join her friends on trail rides but every time she went out riding with her friends she felt like a burden to them because they all had to turn around any time midnight started acting up now sitting on the dirt cradling her broken arm all of her worst fears had come true she told me that after that last fall that sent her to the hospital her husband was so mad that he threatened to take midnight out into the pasture and just put him down he said he loved midnight as much as i did but that he loved me more and wanted me to be safe linda told me after some arguing she managed to talk him down but her husband told her that if midnight hurt her one more time that he would take him to the sale barn and auction him off the thought of sending him away and knowing where the horses go afterwards was too horrible to contemplate she knew that wasnt an option so linda did what she always did and went to another clinic my steady horse clinic this time unable to participate because of her broken arm so she audited it at clinic is end she approached me and there we were were shortly after we got to talking she told me her story and finally asked me the big question she said can you fix midnight for me i do not care what it costs i just want to see my boy fixed on that hot summer texas day i looked linda right in her eyes and said linda im not going to train your horse as soon as the words were out of my mouth i saw her hopes crushed sadness washed over her entire face and her eyes started to fill with tears but that is a good thing i said with a big smile hurrying to finish what i wanted to say i went on here is the deal linda i can take your money and sure when you come out to visit midnight he will behave perfectly but i can promise you that as soon as he gets back home with you he will go right back to his old ways ive been told that albert einstein said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results i told linda the reason why she was having issues with midnight is because he didnt know that he could trust her in stressful circumstances you see there are certain exercises that you can perform with your horse right before you start your ride each time that reinforces to them that they can trust you as their confident leader it is a simple but effective reminder think about it this way i told her when a pilot sits down in the cockpit and prepares for a flight they take the extra time to check everything and make sure there are no problems with the plane and are not we glad they do that is why there are so few plane accidents because they make sure everything is okay on the ground before going up and you have to do the same thing with midnight before every ride there are things you should do to make sure there are no problems and to ensure a safe ride i said linda here is what im going to do im going to give you a copy of my gradual desensitizing dvd and i want you to go home and watch it from start to finish then i want you to go out and do the exercises with midnight and tell me how it goes you can grab the same dvd for 75 off  free shipping just click here for the special link httpgetsteadyhorsecomdesensitizing  that weekend was really busy for me with backtoback clinics happening i had to get ready for the the next clinic so i said a quick goodbye and we both went our separate ways well fast forward two months i receive a phone call from a number i didnt recognize now i do not normally answer random phone numbers because of all the spam out there but for some reason i decided to answer this call lo and behold it was linda i didnt recognize her voice at first because it was filled with happiness and excitement much different than the sad lady who audited my clinic a few months earlier she was over the moon she had just gone away on a weekend horseback riding retreat and had zero issues everything from loading midnight into the trailer to going through a nearby creek midnight performed perfectly you were right linda said happily i went straight home and watched the dvd you gave me from start to finish and then once it was over i watched it all over again i never realized that this entire time i had thought there was something wrong with midnight when in fact it was me all along she even went on to tell me about another minor incident on a recent trail ride when a large tree branch had fallen down during the ride making a terrible noise the noise was so unexpected and loud that three of the other trail riders horses started to buck and freak out but midnight remained perfectly calm she said i did exactly as you told me on the dvd in lesson 7 where you showed us the breathing technique you use to get our horse to draw confidence from us and it worked perfectly it worked so well that the other ladies i was riding with were completely shocked that midnight didnt move a muscle i didnt ask him to and then i did something ive never done before in my life she told me i slowly got down asked midnight to stand still just like you showed us on the dvd and then proceeded to show all the other ladies the exact techniques and methods that i used to show midnight he could trust me in times of panic they were completely blown away at how well it worked the rest of the day was a dream and the entire rest of the weekend i was just beaming with pride usually im the one that causes the group to turn around but now i was the one who taught the group how to move forward linda told me that in that moment she felt like the happiest woman in the world you see what linda discovered and what i want to share with you is that you can have the best most loveydovey relationship with your horse and still have a bad time when it comes to saddling up and getting your horse to really trust you over the years weve lost what it really means to be a true horseman to have a real relationship with our horses where they trust as us their confident leaders im not talking about having a dull broken bombproof horse im talking about becoming the leader your horse can look to and instantly trust that you have their back through even the most stressful situations a companion that you can go on exciting adventures with explore new terrain and know that whatever uncertainty lies ahead that you will get through it together doesnt that sound awesome here is the thing i got to thinking about how linda is experience wasnt all that different from a lot of my students ive met hundreds of people just like her who are struggling to have a meaningful relationship with their horse and i started wondering what was the most impactful thing that i could do help as many people as possible and then it hit me what if i made the gradual desensitizing dvd as accessible as possible by providing a massive discount by doing that anyone who wanted to improve their relationship with their horse and become their confident leader would have the exact same opportunity that linda had so that is what ive decided to do why you ask because i got to thinking about how many people ive worked with who are just like linda and have suffered so much heartbreak or havent really had a relationship with their horse or who have suffered severe injury because of their horse and because of that for a very limited time only im offering my gradual desensitizing dvd for 75 off with free shipping to grab your copy head over to

1,fifteen years ago i was addicted to opioids i had wrecked my back from various jobs the most likely culprit being as a cowboyactor at frontier town i saw one doctor after another trying to find a solution to my pain multiple doctors told me that surgery wouldnt do anything for me and that i just needed to manage the pain so i got a pain management doctor he prescribed hydrocodone telling me i could take as much as i wanted he said it wasnt addictive and yet i be came addicted i kept taking more and more to control my pain after about six months of taking eight to nine pills a day i suddenly started prepping for the apocalypse my wife told me i was paranoid she looked up the symptoms of opioid abuse paranoia was one of the first ones listed like most addicts i told her i could quit anytime i wanted i quit cold turkey i thought i was going to die as i went through the opioid withdrawal i was lucky that i had a massive amount of support from my family my friends and my workplace i never wanted to be addicted it wasnt a choice i was literally following doctors orders since this experience ive spent a lot of time researching initiatives both in this country and abroad i have talked to people who have opioid addictions or are in recovery mental health professionals public health officials elected officials and anyone that would talk to me about this issue these discussions and my own personal experiences have made me realize that there is no one simple solution we need a multifaceted approach to this public health crisis we need to take aggressive measures to combat this crisis the proposals that i bring forward are common sense bipartisan evidencebased ways to tackle this problem fentanyl test strips fentanyl is killing people every day fentanyl is the chief culprit in marylands dramatic increase in overdose deaths if we provide this inexpensive tool to atrisk populations we can at least ensure that the user is aware of the increased potential danger of the drug legalize cannabis studies have shown a correlation between having legal access to cannabis and lower opioid usage ratesas a comparatively safe alternative to opiates legalization would save taxpayers money by eliminating the costs of enforcement and incarceration for cannabis use and possession needle exchange programs taking this step will dramatically lower hiv transmission rates while also saving our health system money in the long run increasing mental health providers this would pay dividends to our society at large reducing crime lowering suicide rates lowering selfmedication and in the end lowering opioid use we need to expand access to services such as instituting the talbot county imbedded school therapist program statewide while also increasing incentives for individuals to enter the field such as covering student loans remove the stigma surrounding mental health and addiction people love awareness campaigns although they dont always do much help solve problems they do help make cracks in the stigma surrounding illness as portugal has shown when the stigma is removed from addiction the likelihood of people seeking treatment massively increases decriminalize drug use we want people to seek help not get used to lying to people about their behavior we have tried the war on drugsit failed decades after the war was declared we have an epidemic that kills more people per year than car accidents or aids ever did as the experiment in portugal has shown decriminalization drastically increases people seeking treatment without increasing opioid use this would not only be a costfree proposal to implement the reduced cost of lower incarceration rates can be redirected to provide treatment to those suffering from substance use disorders give housing to the chronic homeless as the city of salisbury program has shown this reduces costs for the city as it would statewide it is easier to get people into treatment if they have a stable address increase public transportationaccess to addiction treatment and mental health providers this should include utilizing new technologies like facetimeskype therapy as health officials in caroline county are already doing and even organizing rideshare programs on a county or state level if a program existed i believe this could be staffed with volunteers and possibly this can be done via a rideshare app developed by the state lack of access is a huge problem in rural communities letters to doctors this is tough as i know the doctor that prescribed me opioids was only trying to do one thing help me he was a good person who was trying to help me to not be in pain in my experience thats why doctors become doctors because they want to help people and heal people however there is research that shows if doctors receive letters informing them that their patients to whom they have prescribed opioids have died from an overdose they will prescribe less going forward education for children and adults if parents have opioids in their medicine cabinet those medications are not secure we want to believe that our children will not try opioids but we know they might remove the temptation and access perhaps most importantly talk to your kids about the danger of opioid use by the time you are done reading this another american will have died of an overdose we are losing our children we are losing our siblings we are losing our fathers our mothers our friends our artists our teachers our veterans but we are not helpless and we are certainly not hopeless we can learn from what others have done and take action to tackle this crisis however we cannot expect things to get better by just talking about it or just wearing purple awareness campaigns are important but they are not a solution we need real action now if you are currently using opioids there are resources to help consider reaching out to samhsa hotline help

1,"earth day  the funeral of the glacier
good night my name is rob
i have been concerned about the environment and climate change for a long time and one of the biggest goals in the two years i came to the uk
is to study the relationship between arctic sea ice melting and urban human activities
i hope to turn the collected data into artistic creations
reminding people to value all the consumer choices we make can have a huge impact on the environment
the north pole sounds far away from us
but the polar regions contain 70 percent of the world is freshwater and melting is a global catastrophe
due to ocean currents and atmospheric activities
in the arctic in recent years a large amount of marine plastic waste has been accumulated and the ozone layer has been broken
a glacier funeral was held in iceland last august
in memory of the first okjokull ok glacier for short that disappeared due to global warming
the icelandic government and scholars erected monuments at the funeral
the inscription on the tablet reads this is a letter to the future
ok was the first glacier to lose its glacier status but in the next 200 years all glaciers will disappear
this monument is to remember that we understand what is happening and what action should be taken 
sadly the ok glacier is not the only melting glacier in iceland
many of the glaciers on the island such as skaftafeljokull breiamerkurjokull will soon disappear
last november i went to iceland to do fieldwork as a prearctic project
i visited local scholars and residents who attended funerals
collect environmental data by means of photography video and sound
after returning to london it was made into melting island
blue floating blue ephemera two multimedia art creations
it was exhibited in a group exhibition at the royal college of art in february this year
when i was a kid i could see snowy white christmases every year in reykjavik iceland is capital but it rarely snows in cities now
a 50yearold local resident recalled
much of the melting of sea ice has changed the ocean currents around iceland and i fear that in 20 years there will be no four seasons and the melting of the glaciers the lack of fresh water on the island will be unsuitable for survival
a scholar from the university of iceland recounts

today is april 22 earth day
sharing some video recordings of my fieldwork in iceland
hope the people and the landscape are as lovely as ever when i see it next time
even if we live in cities our every action every consumption is still vital to the environment
let us take care of the earth together and avoid the use of disposable tableware plastic products petrochemical energy
leave the beauty of this world to yourself and the next generation

good night everyone this is rob currently living in london
i have been concerned about the environment and climate change for many years one of my primary goals in the past two years in the uk has been to study the connection between the icemelting phenomenon in the arctic ocean and urban human activities around the world 
by creating artistic projects representing the information collected via various methods i hope to remind people that all the consumption choices we make will eventually have huge impacts on the environment the arctic sounds extremely far away from us yet the polar regions contain 70 of the world is freshwater and icemelting is a global disaster besides due to the ocean currents and the flow of the atmosphere in the arctic it has been discovered a large amount of floating plastic waste accumulation and ozone layer holes in recent years 
last august iceland held a funeral to mourn the okjokull glacier that disappeared due to global warming
the icelandic government and scholars set up a monument at the funeral
a letter to the future in the next 200 years all our glaciers are expected to follow the same path this monument is to acknowledge that we know what is happening and what needs to be done only you know if we did it the inscription on the plaque reads
after reading the report about the funeral i went to iceland for a field study in november last year
i visited local scholars and residents who participated in the funeral collected environmental information through photography video and sound recordings after returning to london i produced two multimedia art creations melting island and blue ephemera which are exhibited in the wip show of the royal college of art in this january

on 22nd april earth day 2020 i shared some images i took in iceland and hope that people as well as the landscape will be as lovely as ever when i visit iceland again in the near future
even if we live in the cities every behavior and every consumption is still vital to the environment
let us care more about our earth reduce the use of disposable tableware plastic products and fossil fuel protect the beauty of this world for ourselves and the next generation

1,seems that the va is on a rating reduction rampage recently i have been deluged with vets writing about the va reducing their ratings here are some actual comments im at for ptsd and the va letter i got says they are reducing my rating to they did this from reviewing my records the va doctor looked over my case asked me some questions about my back injury she never asked about my depression and the letter i got said i was better and my rating was being reduced to i just got a rating for my tbi because the doctor said he could not separate my tbi problems from my depression symptoms seriously wtf it seems that recently the va is on a rating reduction rampage why is this happening well it depends upon who you talk to here are some of the reasons reducing a rating reduces the money flowing out of the government the vet gets less benefit money each month and the government saves money now calculate this action by million vets see why the rating rampage is going on there are incompetent clinicians doing reviews im sorry to say this but it is true i read many dbqs and reports and i am shocked at the mistakes and inaccurate diagnosis i come across i was giving an expert opinion in court and afterwards the judge asked me this question i come across so much inconsistency in some psychologist reports especially with the global assessment functioning score the psychologist will be telling me why the client cant work that they are suicidal and then they give them a gaf of can you explain this to me i politely but with some sarcasm replied i have no idea why that happens because i dont make those mistakes he laughed the gaf score is not suppose to be used anymore but the va frequently requests it and you will see it in reports what seems to be happening recently is that a vet is scheduled for a review they meet with the doctor the doctor does not ask enough enquiring questions the vet does not know what symptoms or clinical evidence to tell the doctor and the next thing that happens is they get a va letter saying they have improved which equals a decreased rating i have personally talked to some va docs and contract docs who have told me i never ask about symptoms i want to see what they the vet shares with me if they dont bring up issues then i feel its not important another one said this they the vet have to prove to me they are disabled and another so many of these guys are out for the money its an easy monthly check now of course all docs are not like this but to go into a clinical interview and the doc is already prepared to deny benefits unless the veteran can prove their case is simply unprofessional clinically unsound and i believe unethical and in the end veterans are the ones who lose the other reason this is occurring is that some vets do get better most vets will have a disability review scheduled by the va people do get better and the va wants to see if improvement has happened this is a legitimate reason to have a review of symptoms if psychological conditions have improved through medication or therapy then a rating of impairment would decrease the rating reflects improvement this would be clinically accurate unfortunately many examiners are overworked some care and some dont care sometimes they listen and take good notes sometimes they are tired and leave out important clinical information its the same in any other profession but in the end its the veterans report and it directly affects individual veterans and their families although some of these realities are terrible and some are infuriating but these are the facts these examples may explain why individual veterans can get a rating reduction however if a veteran gets a rating reduction and feels it is unfair unjust inaccurate or seems like it came out of the blue for no reason it can be challenged and i can help contact me im here to get this right for veterans brett valette phd clinical psychologist wwwveteranspsychevaluationscom

with as much anger and hatred as anyone else bringing shame to the name of our lord and his church others are understandably seeing signs that look like what we think the end times will look like and while that is exciting it also means that very hard times will be coming upon the church as weve discussed in recent weeks i want to remind us now of something our lord said and said often in different ways and to different people but a clear message nonetheless speaking of the end times aka day of the lord and that day jesus said matthew but of that day and hour no one knows not even the angels of heaven but my father only matthew watch therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour in which the son of man is coming matthew you know how to discern the face of the sky but you cannot discern the signs of the times mark but of that day and hour no one knows not even the angels in heaven nor the son but only the father acts it is not for you to know times or seasons which the father has put in his own authority so our lord is message is clear while we are to be on the alert and watch for his coming we do not know and we would not know when in fact in one of his teachings jesus says luke therefore you also be ready for the son of man is coming at an hour you do not expect so what does he mean when he says be ready be on the alert watch and similar exhortations does he mean that we should spend our time looking into the sky anticipating his coming no in fact quite the contrary instead of focusing too much on that jesus said occupy till i come or do business until i comeluke jesus is telling us that he expects us to continue doing his business until he returns much as he said in acts after the disciples asked if he would restore the kingdom at that time right before he ascended acts it is not for you to know times or seasons which the father has put in his own authority but you shall receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you and you shall be witnesses to me in jerusalem and in all judea and samaria and to the end of the earth so while it certainly could be true that we are now entering the last days and we should always be alert for that we must nonetheless continue to do the lord is business obediently and faithfully representing him and being his witnesses on this earth which leads me to ask the question that peter asked of the church after describing the ultimate end of this age peter therefore since all these things will be dissolved what manner of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness indeed knowing how everything will ultimately turn out we ask ourselves what manner of persons ought we to be that is a great question and we should give it serious consideration especially when there are so many things coming at us pulling us this way and that even demanding that we react or respond on their terms in some way and whether we sense it or not satan is busy causing and manipulating our present multiple crises to tempt our fallen nature to react as he wants us to but what manner of persons ought we to be according to our lord and his word what manner of speech should be coming through our lips what manner of words should we be typing in messages emails and social media what manner of actions should be taking what manner of thoughts should we have our speech words actions and yes our thoughts are open and bare to our lord and they should all reflect and represent him so what manner ought they to be what do our bornagain spirits lead us to be as opposed to our flesh there are many answers to this question and really they are no different from the basic characteristics that should describe us at any and all times but considering the somewhat unique pressures we are experiencing these days let is focus on a few that may be particularly salient so what manner of persons ought we to be we ought to be righteous as we walk in jesus steps matthew blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven have you ever put yourself in this verse romans and do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin but present yourselves to god as being alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness to god corinthians for he made him who knew no sin to be sin for us that we might become the righteousness of god in him the great exchange the definition of righteousness is difficult to pin down but we know that it speaks to integrity virtue purity of life rightness correctness of thinking feeling and acting in scripture as it is applied to our lord there is the meaning of perfection as well that is why we should never attempt to rely on our own righteousness but on christ is which is imputed to us at the same time jesus says that we should hunger and thirst for righteousness meaning that it should be our conscious passionate desire to live righteous lives in addition paul clearly instructs to not allow ourselves to be instruments of unrighteousness but on the contrary we should be god is instruments of righteousness so with selfexamination in light of our current circumstances can you say that your words actions and thoughts are predominantly righteous before your god shouldnt righteous be central to the manner of persons we are does it describe you but james gives us a strong warning regarding righteousness particularly relevant in these days james for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of god so if we truly hunger and thirst for righteousness we must exercise selfcontrol with our anger and that may be a serious problem for us these days so pray what manner of persons ought we to be we ought to be faithful and obedient faithful to our god and obedient to the principles and dictates of his word in one of his letters to the churches in revelation jesus said revelation be faithful until death and i will give you the crown of life faithful trustworthy reliable even in the face of the most severe circumstances be faithful until death jesus said and i will give you the crown of life many people believe that we the church may be facing those days very soon and even if we are not yet we are still required to be faithful and obedient in fact if we claim to love our lord jesus we must be obedient john if you love me keep my commandments he who has my commandments and keeps them it is he who loves me and he who loves me will be loved by my father and i will love him and manifest myself to him if anyone loves me he will keep my word and my father will love him and we will come to him and make our home with him so are we being faithful and obedient even in our thoughts as we watch the news i confess that i struggle there and really need to continually call on the strength of the holy spirit to help me what manner of persons ought we to be we certainly ought to be loving in our words actions and thoughts since our god is love john we certainly must manifest that love in our own lives as well even in the most extreme ways luke but i say to you who hear love your enemies do good to those who hate you bless those who curse you and pray for those who spitefully use you love bless and pray for your enemies for those who hate and curse you for those who spitefully use you certainly those can only come from our newborn spirits empowered by the holy spirit within usbut since our lord commands it then we know that we are able to do it and by the way the word for love here is agapeo which as we know is not so much an emotional love as one of thought and decision it is very strong but does not indicate emotional attraction ok there are many more things we could point to as being necessary characteristics of the manner of people that we the church ought to be but i want to close this brief list with one that can be seen as including them all be holy holy the word means  iseparated sanctified dedicated  iset apart to god for god and that is clearly what our god expects of us we are to be holy the church is to be holy we are to be separate from this world because we have been dedicated to god at the same time we are to live in and have impact and influence on this world as jesus prayed to the father in john yet the world is not to have influence over us look at what god is word says ephesians he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love ephesians so that he might present her to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that she should be holy and without blemish peter but as he who called you is holy you also be holy in all your conduct because it is written be holy for i am holy corinthians therefore come out from their midst and be separate says the lord and do not touch what is unclean and i will welcome you what manner of persons ought we to be we ought to be righteous obedient faithful loving and holy and we are not just looking at outward actions and words but also inwardly how we think and you know that is the most difficult that is why we frequently use david is great prayer at the end of psalm psalm search me o god and know my heart try me and know my anxieties and see if there is any wicked way in me and lead me in the way everlasting search me o god dig all around in my heart and my mind test me if necessary and reveal to me any unholy unrighteous unloving disobedient unfaithful wicked way in me so i can confess to you and be forgiven and then lead me in the right way your way your path the everlasting way of eternal life if we are to be like this what words should come out of our mouths and off our fingers in letters texts emails and social media ephesians let no unwholesome word proceed from your mouth or fingers but only such a word as is good for edification according to the need of the moment so that it will give grace to those who hear or read and our thought life what should that be like philippians finally brethren whatever things are true whatever things are noble whatever things are just whatever things are pure whatever things are lovely whatever things are of good report if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthymeditate on these things so in light of all the chaos and anarchy we are experiencing as a people all the cowardly foolish and evil leaders and violent thugs all the fearmongering and racist hatred being fueled by the media with all the biblical truths and miraculous new spiritual births all the loving brothers and sisters of every color and ethnicity in the church not to mention our perfect loving heavenly father and our lord jesus christ in light of all that and more what manner of persons ought we the church of jesus christ in the midst of this world be and finally do not allow the very tangible reality of the evil violence and plague of our day to cause you to be blind to the presence power and sovereignty of our god do not allow what screams so loudly for your attention because it is visible to give you tunnel vision myopia that you miss the schemes of satan and fail to do battle in the power of our lord broaden your vision because god is great plan is still on track points for prayer where there is chaos pray for and act in the opposite way peace and order where there is hate pray for and act in the opposite way love and tenderness toward others where there is division pray for and act in the opposite way unity and compassion where there is deception pray for and act in the opposite way honesty truth and transparency where there is fear pray for and act in the opposite way security in god and active strong faith where there is greed pray for and act in the opposite way contentment and generosity

1,coverup tonight is council meeting had a surprise report from the use of force expert the report was not on the advance agenda callison inserted it at the last minute which was obviously a tactic so the council did not have time to go over the report and think about it so they could better ask questions it was also probably a technique to ensure that people would not turn out the way they would have if they had known this was on the agenda unfortunately the council didn t insist that mr carpenter come back another time when his presence could be advertised in advance so any who cared could come listen the report was about as useful as i though it would be which is not at all useful the differences between the officers statements and marks statements were excused via cherry picking statements out of context and attributing differences in the statements to the the inaccuracy of old memories due to amount of time that elapsed between between the event and the statements of shoudy and brewer he did not seem to apply to same standard to mark is statement which was just as old and he said other things that were simply not factual which is odd to say the least because they are so easy to check for example he said that shoudy was feet away when the incident happened implying that he could not have seen well enough from that distance to know what was going on but shoudy is statement says that yes when he first saw brewer marks and procapio he was feet away but by the time the leg sweep took place he was on procapio is right side while brewer was on the right and marks was behind he was hired to represent callison is and marks side of events and he did as well as could be done with poor material for example citing overwhelming general statistics of how much trouble a handcuffed person could cause rather than the facts of the current matter he cherry picked outofcontext statements from the banks report he went exhaustively into procopio is prior bad history but said nothing about marks prior bad history because he was not given that information even the complaint charlie and i made in was absent since it had aged out of the required record is retention system the fact that others have tried to make a complaint and were not offered a way to do so was also not shared with him he was a salesman using salesman techniques like the insertion of mounds of irrelevant facts in an attempt to obscure the basic issue and attempting to draw in the audience to his side by addressing it in a folksy manner and asking it to imagine things from marks point of view he spends a lot of time in court trying to persuade juries to believe the side that is paying him and it showed in his manner i continue to think that the liability issue the the main insurmountable issue for the city how can you keep someone with such a strong history of bad behavior and not expose the city to lawsuits but who knows we live in strange days

1,dirty gratitude number i am grateful that i wonder if i am racist i am questioning myself tonight i am digging deep and asking myself am i in any way racist i have very few friends that are not white i do not feel like this is because i chose that way i feel it is more because i live a somewhat sheltered life in the sense that i do not meet a whole lot of new people the few black friends that i do have i met through my previous restaurant job at dia of them are men one of them is a woman and i enjoyed working with them all for different reasons roxy is fiery and spunky and i immediately liked her we would joke about her husband and bond over girl talk i didnt work with her for very long but i missed her when she was gone armand he quite possibly has the biggest heart of anyone i have ever met he hugs everyone when he comes into work and tells them i am so happy to see you i have been fascinated by his stories of his early childhood in africa with more brothers and sisters than i can imagine and i was transported into a different life when he would talk about it he was then raised in germany and france and i loved the conversations we had about his life and where he has been he is an extremely devoted father and to watch his face light up when he would talk about his son would make anyone smile bobby is from georgia he is unnervingly polite and kind but never a pushover i always felt guilty swearing around him not that he minded i even found myself picking up dag gum as my new swear word he is also an incredibly devoted father he calls his daughter punkinhead and it might be the sweetest thing i have ever heard tarik is much younger than i and absolutely brilliant there were times when the guy would drive me nuts he loves to debate and he is good at it i didnt like it because i am more of a let is find some common ground kinda woman at the end of the day though it he challenged me to think deeper about myself without even knowing itand i greatly appreciate that about him markus oh my goodness i love him he is kind and hilarious and crazy and unapologetically gay as he should be his flamboyant nature i was immediately drawn to it was somehow infectious for me i am a huge fan of will and grace and for halloween i wanted us to go as black jack and karen at work he of course had bigger and better ideas when i found out that bobby and armand were fathers i never once questioned that they would be anything else other than devoted they are just fathers not black men who are fathers when i suggested to markus that we be black jack and karen he appeared to find it funny but now i question if that might have offended him in any way i believe that i didnt judge these men and this woman because of their skin color i believe that i had the same interactions with them that i would with anyone but i am now questioning myself was there any part of me that had a preconceived notion of them because of the color of their skin most importantly if there was what am i going to do to change that i do not know what it is like to be a minority i am a woman and that tends to comewith its own set of challenges in everyday life i do wonder sometimes how incredibly different my life would be if i were a black woman and the first thing that comes to mind is that i wouldnt want to be this is not because i believe that a black woman is less than me it is because i know it would immediately mean being at a societal disadvantage just because of the color of my skin i was a single mother at i came from a very loving and supportive family but what if i didnt what would i have done to make money to put food on the table for my child and to diaper her would i have sold drugs quite possibly when you are desperate the color of your skin doesnt come into play survival for yourself and your child does i also used to be a very frequent drug user i am a white woman who was introduced to cocaine by her white boss i worked with all white people and a lot of them did drugs our addiction didnt care what color our skin was the reality is there are good people of every color and there are bad there are good cops and bad cops there are people who believe in a cause and will peacefully protest and there are those who are opportunists and will loot and riot and take the focus off of that cause for their own gain we are all human and the thing we need to remember is that just because we do not understand another human or do not recognize ourselves in them it doesnt make them any different than us and it certainly doesnt make them less than if you get to know someone you will most likely find that at the end of the day we all just want to be loved and accepted for who we are i bet you do one of the best quotes i have ever read is how does it hurt you to not hurt someone else i have carried it as my mantra since i read it so tonight i sit here and ask am i racist on top of that are you are you willing to dig deeper and ask yourself some of the same questions that i as a flawed human have asked myself what will you come up with if you do and when you brush your teeth tonight are you also willing to look yourself in the mirror and ask how does it hurt me to not hurt someone else i very much hope that you do with love amber

industrial food waste has been a burden for every sector involved concentrated animal feeding operations food processors local waste collectors and above all our environment traditional disposal methods all have their own environmental risks as highlighted in this video meanwhile traditional agriculture practices have depleted our soils of organic matter and farmers are continuously looking for new ways to replenish their soil with organics and microbial life
the progressive digestion process pdp is an environmentally responsible technology that harnesses the natural microbial and enzymatic digestion of organic inputs to break down raw materials while creating biological heat eliminating harmful pathogens in the process this digestion is achieved without adding any outside inoculum or external heat to kill pathogens

last weekend i started getting calls from firefighters police officers and first responders around the state on the front lines in our battle with coronavirus theyd been promised personal protective equipment face masks especially to protect our community
for weeks the masks they were promised hadnt come some agencies were moving to what they call crisis use where theyd take masks that should have been used once and use them 57 times
i started making calls to see what we could get done here is the thing when i told people that we needed to get masks for our first responders every single person i called said yes
volunteers said what can i do the st louis fire foundation stepped forward donors said yes i called people around the country and some around the globe to find the gear we needed and everyone helped
that was sunday night the next day we signed a contract today we delivered gear and the rest of it will be with our first responders tomorrow
nearly 15000 masks
having had my hands on the problem i can tell you that there is absolutely no reason why our front line organizations should not have the gear that they need to protect themselves their families and all of us
people stepped forward and we got it done
we got requests from and were able to get gear for the st louis fire department cape county fire department cape county sheriff is office st louis police department jackson pd st louis county pd kansas city police department cass county sheriff is office harrisonville pd new madrid county sheriff is office scott county sheriff is office platte county sheriff is office raytown pd st joseph pd buchanan county sheriff is office andrew county sheriff is office savannah pd cameron pd clinton county sheriff is office davies county sheriff is office harrison county sheriff is office and bethany pd nodaway county sheriff is office maryville pd

another time i was with my grandson at the mets spring training camp at port st lucie florida when i introduced jack to him bartolo was just great posing for photos and autographing a baseball it is a moment jack will never forget
now bartolo has written his autobiography appropriately entitled big sexy during the enduring darkness of the pandemic big sexy is a shining light of enjoyment and hope for all baseball fans in his own words bartolo describes his climb from abject poverty in the dominican republic to major league stardom his story is interesting and inspiring a great read during tough days

it is not the title of the song with which betty curtis revolutionized music in the s but it is what in italy now everyone is asking due to the economic crisis triggered by the coronavirus
as is well known fca atlantia arcelor mittal and others asked for money from the street vendor to the small shopkeeper and gradually up to the big industry
what is disconcerting however is that they are asking for figures from many zeros including companies and individuals who in previous years declared derisory revenues to the tax authorities
the government has already approved and allocated billion euros of new debts which will fall on the heads of our children because sooner or later they will have to be paid and there are those who expect hundreds of billions to rain from europe even if they were sweets which if they come will be by way of loans with heavy conditionality and in any case there is the sinister feeling that they would not be enough even if they were billion euros
i remind you that today is billion is equivalent to thousand billion of the old lire and therefore in the interest of the nation since we are talking about large figures i would like to suggest that the government be very careful to distribute this enormous wealth without responding to logic patronage or worse still political and party squandering this great opportunity for economic recovery
but rather to exploit it to strengthen our agricultural commercial industrial activities requiring above all certain guarantees on the use of these resources finalizing them to the restructuring improvement innovation and modernization of companies with the possibility of control by inspectors state and with the commitment not to fire and not to close the business except for proven reasons

preparation montana must guarantee that our health care providers and hospitals have the equipment they need at the same time we must demand that our federal officials reinstate and expand the federal preparedness infrastructure that has recently been dismantled and grossly mismanaged
opportunity as we rebuild we have the opportunity to rethink our priorities and consider major structural changes we need a green recovery where we build an environmentally sustainable infrastructure supporting renewable energy climate smart agriculture and forest management energy efficient building construction low emission vehicles and better public transportation as we address massive unemployment we need to also address festering inequalities by expanding health care access universal child care family leave sick leave and a guaranteeing a fair minimum wage
finally engagement nobody can sit on the sidelines we are all in this together we must all be engaged in the process which begins by voting

1,"one of my first thoughts about the c virus was that modern life has made this im not a technophobe or a luddite  it seems simply obvious to me
meat eating flying and pollution are key players
enabling spreading and amplifying the impact respectively
take the incredible rise in meat consumption of the last few decades driven by or driving industrial farming and land clearance this industry and this diet is a root cause of viruses  like this one on a simple level if we didnt eat animals the chances of a zoonotic virus like this are reduced big time
and having made it possible the mind boggling amount of flying that goes on in the world simply allowed it to spread like a metaphorical virus  from one country to the whole world in a matter of weeks
the flying component of this is rock solid  there is no room for argument
the link to meat eating will seem more tenuous simplistic maybe and to be expected from a vegan
but there is scientific evidence to support this
there are 143 known zoonotic viruses  those that have jumped from animals to humans some are from wild animals and loss of habitat is part of the cause causing closer proximity to humans  but domesticated mostly farmed animals are responsible for eight times as many zoonotic viruses as wild animals are two links that might be useful
httpswwwtheguardiancomworld2020mar28isfactoryfarmingtoblameforcoronavirus
httpswwwtheguardiancomenvironment2020apr08humanimpactonwildlifetoblameforspreadofvirusessaysstudyaoe
and then there is pollution  emerging evidence that people previously exposed to polluted air are more likely to die from this virus than others and today the news that scientists in italy have found the virus in airborne particles of pollution in the north of that country raising the possibility that the virus is hitching a ride on these bigger less dense pollution particles  like a passenger on an airplane it is a theory just now the virus has been found but it is not known if it is viable  able to infect people but we may find that pollution plays a dual role increasing the fatality rate  and as a carrier of the infection itself
i think whichever way you look at this modern life is unsustainable creating the conditions for zoonotic viruses to exist spreading them like wildfire and reducing our ability to resist them  or avoid them because pollution is so prevalent in our world
the answers are simple and they are the same ones we need to deal with the climate crisis
we have to stop burning fossil fuels  it is not just co2 but all forms of airborne pollution that come from this causing not just climate change but a crisis in human health up to 40k deaths a year just in the uk we do not need to give up energy  just replace fossil fuels with renewable energy the world has more than enough  there is enough wind energy potential in europe alone to power the whole world britain has enough to power itself four times over for example
and we need to electrify transport as part of this swapping fossil fuels for electricity made from the wind and the sun while we make the transition  fossil fuel use needs now to pay for it is external costs not just the climate but the health crisis too that has to include flying  we subsidise that to our great detriment
and we have to stop eating animals their offspring and their bodily fluids  meat and dairy we do not have to stop eating  we just have to swap animals for plants in doing that we take the pressure off wildlife which weve driven almost to extinction as well as deal with the climate and health crisis  eating animals is at the root of the main chromic illnesses that affect us in older life as well as the rise in zoonotic viruses it is simply not good for us
before the virus struck the main arguments against taking action to avert the climate crisis where the cost of doing so and the changes to our way of life we would have to endure this virus has exposed both these issues for what they are  just excuses
britain will spend over 300 billion in a period of a few weeks dealing with the immediate impact of the virus the final cost will be far higher and gdp looks set to take a hit of up to 35 this yearthat is ten years of the money we need to spend to become zero carbon as a country and a gdp hit roughly 20 times higheraccording to the most recent report of the government is climate change committee
and we do not need to live in lockdown to fight the climate crisis  for which there is no vaccine by the way and no escaping by isolation
the cost of fighting the climate crisis was previously unthinkable to many  this virus has redefined many things  unthinkable is one of them"

when the city council reaches the discussion of solar power plants in north livermore valley the public will be given the opportunity to comment on what action the city should take prior to the city council making a decision please speak and state your views
it is important that you speak then even if the points you wish to raise have been made by another person in this context numbers count and please let the city council know if you are a resident of the city of livermore it is important that the city council knows that livermore residents care deeply about preserving the open space in north livermore valley
while the city of livermore does not have direct jurisdiction over projects in north livermore valley alameda county has this jurisdiction the city of livermore has adopted an urban growth boundary that calls for north livermore valley open space agricultural land and natural habitats to be preserved
we have asked that the mayor and city council join us join us in opposing the approval of industrial solar power plants in north livermore valley or in the alternative call for a halt on the review of the proposed industrial solar power plants until alameda county completes with vigorous public input a comprehensive solar policy for agricultural districts that would subsequently be incorporated in a general plan amendment
despite starting and stopping twice in the last decade alameda county has never completed a comprehensive solar policy for the rural areas of the county as a result we are left with ad hoc review of individual mega solar plants without reference to policies and standards developed in consultation with experts in the fields of renewable energy and environmental protection and following the input of the community
again please ask the livermore city council to call upon alameda county officials to preserve north livermore valley on monday august 10th the meeting starts at 7 pm
together we can save our valley thank you
please share this message you can learn about about what is being proposed and what is at stake at wwwsavenorthlivermorevalleycom"

1,"assembly member linda rosenthal and state senator luis sepulveda have introduced a bill in new york state that would close all live animal markets specifically prohibiting the operation of establishments where animals andor fowls are slaughtered or butchered for food it will also establish a task force to decide whether they should be banned indefinitely
while this is an outlandish piece of legislation this latest move from rosenthal comes as no surprise she has spent her career working against animal agriculture as well as other animal industries such as limiting hunting banning pet breeding and sales banning horse drawn carriages rodeos and more over the years we have written a number of articles about rosenthal is animal extremism and the legislation she has proposed these articles can be found on our website with a simple search if you are interested in learning more
bills introduced in both the senate and assembly
there are two identical versions of this bill being presented in both the new york senate and assembly the assembly bill a has been introduced by linda rosenthal d and the senate version s by state senator luis sepulveda d both bills are currently in committee awaiting to be heard on the floor these two legislators are working in conjunction to close the live markets that reside in the state of new york
false claims versus the facts
in a statement rosenthal has falsely claimed that these facilities do not adhere to any sanitary guidelines nor do they see any regulation or oversight the truth is that the new york state department of agriculture and markets nystam is directly responsible for overseeing and regulating live animal markets in the state according to their annual report the department of animal industry dia tested over birds that year at several hundred different markets and dealers and none were positive for the avian flu the same can be said for as well the department of animal industry is made up of a staff of field and office veterinarians animal health inspectors and more all dedicated to ensuring that the animals going through those markets are healthy and safe for human consumption
the nysdam annual report also explains that
domestic animal health permits dahp are issued to livestock and poultry dealers department laws and regulations require dealers to properly identify animals and record the details of all transactions to allow for tracing to the point of origin and disposition dai veterinarians and animal health inspectors conducted dahp inspections on dahp holders during field staff also inspect livestock markets to determine compliance with department laws and regulations in general market inspections are performed quarterly and consist of a facility inspection evaluation of cleaning and disinfection procedures and an inspection of animal identification and recordkeeping practices dai field veterinarians and animal health inspectors performed livestock market inspections on markets
this proves that not only is there oversight and regulation pertaining to live animal markets in new york but also that those regulations are being implemented successfully as a lawmaker in the state of new york rosenthal should know this if she is aware of the department of animal industry is veterinarians and animal health inspectors then what does that say about the claims she is making
legislators ties to the animal extremist movement
linda rosenthal has spent her entire career sponsoring outrageous legislation that pushes forward the ideology and agenda of animal extremist organizations some of the language in her legislation has been so restrictive that it would make it impossible to even have a pet dog just this year she proposed a bill that would limit options for pet owners by banning pet stores from selling dogs cats and rabbits she has solidly aligned herself with organizations and legislation that seeks to limit animal ownership in the state and animal industries that reside there the animal extremist group the humane society of the united states awarded rosenthal with the humane legislator of the year award based on her efforts to push legislation that aligns with their movement
luis sepulveda is closely associated with nyclass an animal rights organization we have highlighted before especially due to their continued efforts to ban carriage horses in new york city nyclass has endorsed both sepulveda and rosenthal among others based on their cooperation with carriage horse bans
misinformation must be addressed
amidst the coronavirus pandemic there have been several claims from animal extremist groups that are blatantly false regarding its connection to animals while the pandemic has been traced back to originating in bats it is false to claim that animal agriculture is to blame we as an organization refuse to sit idly by as animal agriculture is maligned by those who benefit from its demise this pandemic has affected most of us in some way however this situation has proven the importance of standing strong with our food producers and supporting them as much as possible we will continue to share truthful information about food production and will never stop bringing animal extremism to light"

1,"what is the progressive agenda
yes we all agree that donald trump is the worst president ever and also literally one of the worst human beings of all time
that is all well and good but it is intellectually dishonest and downright lazy to only criticize a personideathing without having a cogent vision or concept for a better version of said personideathing
so in the case of american politics in general and the donald trump presidency in particular we here at vhom believe that better version to be the progressive agenda
but what in actual fact is the progressive agenda
well
according to a july 2019 poll conducted by the marist college institute for public opinion in poughkeepsie new york following are the most popular ideas that make up a politically progressive agenda in the united states from most popular to least popular
you may not agree with every idea or their ranking in the list but vhom believes that for now at least this is about the most legitimate intellectually honest and rigorous description of what the progressive agenda actually is and the possible future it represents for the good ol us of a once the stinky dumpster fire of a presidency were are currently forced to endure on a dailyhourlyminutely basis has finally been extinguished once and for all
so without further adieu i give you
the progressive agenda
1 background checks for gun purchases at gun shows or other private sales

5 legalizing marijuana nationally
6 a green new deal to address climate change by investing government money in green jobs and energy efficient infrastructure
7 a wealth tax that is a higher tax rate on income above one million dollars
8 a ban on the sale of semiautomatic assault guns such as the ak47 or the ar15
9 a national minimum wage of 15 per hour
10 having the united states rejoin the paris climate agreement
11 free college tuition at public colleges or universities
12 a tax on emissions of carbonbased fuels such as coal oil and natural gas
13 repealing obamacare
14 getting rid of the electoral college as part of the presidential election process
15 medicare for all that is a national health insurance program for all americans that replaces private health insurance
16 abolishing the death penalty
17 a national health insurance program available for immigrants who are in the us illegally
18 decriminalizing illegal border crossings

1,"lg is promise of dialogue and development jammu needs attention to its aspirations
sahil mahajan
new lieutenant governor of jammu and kashmir manoj sinha has started his innings in the union territory he has stirred hopes of a new era visiting jk with his ideas a mix of tradition and innovation it is however to be seen where exactly jammu region stands in his scheme of things
undoubtedly kashmir is under greater spotlight because of the peculiar situation over there yet jammu has its own situation and demands that are quite different from that of the valley the region deserves as much attention as the valley
it is needless to draw a comparison between two regions it is rather well known jammu has greater linkages with the national mainstream politically and geographically and of late it is also at the ideological level beyond the spirit of patriotism that has always been the hallmark of jammu
since the lg has given an expression to hold direct dialogue with the people and listen to their grievances and to make efforts to redress these it is firmly hoped that the grievances of jammu region would find an equal attention of sinha and the administration that he now heads in jammu and kashmir
geographically culturally ethnically and linguistically diverse jammu region has its own compulsions not to air its grievances as loudly as the people would have done at any other place in the country jammu is destiny is linked to kashmir because of the history that determines its geography too at the same time jammu is committed in all ways and means to the indian nationhood
therefore it has to be cautious with its words and actions ensuring that nothing goes wrong that may impact the situation in the valley it is aware that it has to make sacrifices in the national interest for that reason it has kept a lid on many of its grievances
that should not mean that there should be no understanding of its concerns or no efforts should be made to keep jammu is aspirations in mind what is important is that jammu deserves not only its due as a region that is part of jammu and kashmir but also needs to be rewarded for the sacrifices it has made for the nation the reward should not be mistaken as a compensation
manoj sinha by his work and training is a politician who it is learnt knows how to read the pulse of the people so it should not be difficult for him to understand what jammu needs and how that can be delivered as he is a bjp man and the saffron party has its deep roots in jammu it is incumbent upon his party to articulate the region is grievances which should be fair and objective in the first place the bjp leaders of jammu should not be shy of spelling things in a camouflaged vocabulary to be here and there too or neither here nor there
then other parties that operate in jammu including congress jk national panthers party bahujan samaj party and other big or small groups too should be involved in the dialogue process because they are the also part of the mainstream that have interests in jk and the nation as well that will send a very powerful message to the people that their nationalistic credentials have been recognized and rewarded
economically its sufferings and potential also need a closer look the details on its safe environment and entrepreneurship cannot be overemphasized this is not a comparison but a statement of facts there are social and other issues and each one of them can be addressed stepwise"

1,making a case for joe biden more than just that he polls well against donald trump and let us start off by saying that those polls should not be ignored joe biden has had a consistent edge over the other democratic candidates in headtohead polling against trump in national surveys going back to last march biden kicks trump is butt additionally biden polls much better against trump than other candidates in swing states but right now let us focus on some things that biden brings to the table in terms of the sheer number of issues biden influenced during his time in the obama administration foreign policy and fiscal issues are among many items in biden is portfolio back in it was biden is office that primarily orchestrated the handover of iraq to the iraqis it is biden is view of afghanistan that bit by bit came to dominate thinking inside the withdrawal plan on financial reform it was biden who prodded an indecisive obama to embrace paul volcker is idea of barring banks from risky trading according to austan goolsbee formerly the head of obama is council of economic advisers biden also tilted the discussion in favor of a bailout of the big three auto companies according to jared bernstein biden is former economic adviser i think he made a difference in president is thinking bernstein said he understood the importance of the auto companies to their communities and throughout the country thanks to his decades in the senate biden came to the job of vp with a deep understanding of the way the federal government operates which enabled him to oversee projects that spanned different agencies and different branches most importantly he was in charge of implementing the american recovery and reinvestment act recovery act which was one of the administrations great unsung successes it involved a huge amount of work and coordination and by every account biden performed exceptionally well at it just the fact that they managed to distribute over threequarters of a trillion dollars without any major scandals of graft or theft was an extraordinary accomplishment biden led the successful administration effort to gain senate approval for the new start treaty strategic arms reduction treaty this is a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the united states and the russian federation with the formal name of measures for the further reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms it was signed on april th in prague and after ratification entered into force on february th it is expected to last at least until biden declared his support for marriage equality on national television in three days before barack obama did hes been a champion of lgbtq rights and made big waves when he said its going to become a political liability in the near term for an individual to say i oppose gay marriage mark my words in a interview with the human rights campaigns chad griffin his support for the lgbtq community continued throughout his vice presidency biden officiated a samesex wedding at the vice presidential residence in washington dc marrying two longtime white house staffers buzzfeed reported at the state of the union address obama announced the establishment of cancer moonshot an initiative led by biden that would accelerate cancer research making more therapies available to more patients while improving our ability to prevent cancer and detect it in early stages according to the national cancer institute moonshot came almost a year after bidens son beau died of brain cancer in may of at age biden is violence against women act was reauthorized in and the act led to further related developments in the creation of the white house council on women and girls begun in obama is first term as well as the white house task force to protect students from sexual assault begun in january with biden as cochair along with valerie jarrett biden has a strong stance on sexual assault for example biden stated to a victim of sexual assault at stanford university you did it in the hope that your strength might prevent this crime from happening to someone else your bravery is breathtaking he has also taken legality into the situation biden issued federal guidelines while presenting a speech at the university of new hampshire he stated that no means no if you are drunk or you are sober no means no if you are in bed in a dorm or on the street no means no even if you said yes at first and you changed your mind no means no biden was selected to head up a special task force on the issue of gun control after a school shooting at a newtown connecticut elementary school biden delivered solutions for reducing gun violence across the nation to president obama in january he helped craft actions that the president could take on the issue using his power of executive order among other recommendations among presidential candidates biden has the longest legislative record on climate change he pioneered some of the earliest climate change legislation in us history his first climate change bill introduced in did not pass in the senate but the following year a version of bidens legislation survived as an amendment to a state department funding bill president ronald reagan went on to sign it into law the upshot of bidens global climate protection act was to call on the president to set up a task force to plan how to mitigate global warming the measure also asked him to make climate change a higher priority item on the ussoviet agenda biden supports governmental funding to find new energy sources he cosponsored the sense of the senate resolution calling on the united states to be a part of the united nations climate negotiations and the boxersanders global warming pollution reduction act the most stringent climate bill in the united states senate under obama the recovery act implemented by biden made the largest single investment in clean energy in history providing more than billion in strategic clean energy investments and tax incentives to promote job creation and the deployment of lowcarbon technologies and leveraging approximately billion in private and other nonfederal capital for clean energy investments joe is skilled at reaching across the aisle to get things done he can sit down in foreign policy or other issues and find a common interest and drive the ideas forward look at what he did with jesse helms and strom thurmond in passing the chemical weapons treaty and crime bills respectively in the s his former chief of staff and later successor ted kaufman noted back then i mean jesse helms and strom thurmond you do not get more conservative than that let us remember biden is debate performance in he faced his republican counterpart representative paul ryan in the lone vice presidential debate on october th in danville kentucky there he made a feisty emotional defense of the obama administration is record and energetically attacked the republican ticket this helped the obama campaign regain momentum after obama is first lackluster debate performance biden is most important role within the obama administration was to question assumptions playing a contrarian role obama said that the best thing about joe is that when we get everybody together he really forces people to think and defend their positions to look at things from every angle and that is very valuable for me another senior obama advisor said biden is always prepared to be the skunk at the family picnic to make sure we are as intellectually honest as possible and on and on and on is joe biden a perfect human being of course not who is but is biden an intelligent man who could bring a lot of important experience and skill to the white house at a time when we desperately need to be rid of donald trump hell yes and let us once again emphasize biden polls very well against trump compared to other democratic candidates who either have far less experience are too ideologically extreme or both i say we need joe biden

1,he died his soul had left his body the last moments of his life were being replayed in his head over and over again until darkness absorbed them there was nothing but darkness the hero of the underground ring was stabbed to death by the one to whom he had entrusted his heart he was capable of winning even the most difficult fights but couldnt defend himself against his beloved he could no longer see or hear or feel he couldnt be for some reason he was still aware of himself his past and even his personality the only thing he had forgotten was his name it seemed to him that he had never had one but his memories claimed otherwise he had no idea how much time he had spent in that darkness maybe an hour maybe a day a year or perhaps even an eternity it couldve even been a single moment time didnt exist there gradually something began to change and he felt distinctly alive like a newborn he became suddenly aware of his existence he opened his eyes at least he tried to open them his left eyelid was swollen and it wouldnt move but he managed to open his right one with a lot of effort at first everything was blurry but after a while his vision became a little clearer the man saw endless wide skies spread above him was a clean and calm ocean of blue there wasnt a single cloud only a majestic light his hearing came back right after his vision it happened rather abruptly the man heard a stream gurgling somewhere nearby carrying muffled voices next came the sense of smell the pungent aroma of sewage and feces hung in the air at the same moment he tasted something bitter that reminded him of metal there was blood in his mouth the last to recover was the sense of touch the man finally felt his own body hands legs torso head it all seemed so unusual after his soul had spent some time in the darkness a forgotten feeling he didnt want to move and even if he had tried the pain wouldve impaled him on the spot even lying motionless the man felt his hands burning with pain and blood oozing from the wound on his leg water mixed with blood was touching his skin making it sting and itch his breathing was weak and irregular and his chest hurt the man had no desire to do anything looking at the endless skies with one halfopen eye he reflected he was thinking about why he was here why had life given him another chance what for pain his soul couldnt find peace even after death how sad then his memories started coming back someone else is memories began to merge with his memories of the previous owner of the body he had found himself in he too had recently died allowing him to be reborn his story was also a tragic one he was only fourteen when he was mutilated killed and thrown into a ditch because of a petty theft he had committed so as not to die of hunger his family had moved to this city not long before that event occurred an epidemic broke out the nature and origins of which remained unknown annihilating almost a tenth of the local population his parents had died a year earlier and left him a small shack and some money he wouldve continued to live on but he was unfortunate enough to have come across a member of one of the city is ruling families broken hands and death were an unjust punishment strange how the man wasnt at all bothered by that right now there was no anger or hatred in him only boundless apathy and a drop of incomprehensible joy the man finally remembered a name it wasnt his however no it belonged to the previous owner but it was still a name his name was kai kai arnhard for some reason he was quite pleased with this suddenly kai was filled with a strange sensation and incomprehensible lines of text showed up before his eyes surprising him life and emotional activity discovered canceling uninstall system restoring the structure resuming work the system has been restored and is ready for use test opening of the options menu to check the mind of the carrier stats age 14 race human status mortal stage none level none characteristics power 024 speed 049 endurance 03 stamina 05 mind 21 energy 067 abilities none paths unknown what is this a thought flashed through his shocked mind having regained focus he managed to dig out the memories that might hold answers to his questions as it turned out everyone in this world had such a system kai had no doubts that he was now a part of a completely different world and that he was no longer on earth however he wasnt sure how much martial arts masters like him were worth here the system appeared in people at the moment of their birth and remained there until they died apparently having considered kai dead it began uninstalling itself but the presence of another soul stopped it only one thing remained unclear how and why did he enter the corpse and for what reason had the system started functioning again what had stimulated it the past kai knew little about it as he was from a poor and illiterate family but the new kai who had lived on earth for a long time guessed that it was something like a neural interface a computer placed in a person is brain that millions of people from his world could only dream about the little knowledge that the past kai did have he had gained from the general information window of the system and rumors that he had heard from his parents as the present kai understood it the system scanned the characteristics of the body at birth and displayed them in the brain in the form of numbers it performed the same action whenever any stat changed the system was constantly monitoring them they were calculated in relation to the average value of the physical abilities of a twentyyearold human with a score of one being equivalent to that value kai is stats were extremely low right now even for his age the reason behind it was his crippled and beatenup body present kai reread the information window not wanting to rely only on past kai is memories power was responsible for all manifestations of physical strength and speed for the speed of muscle contraction transmission of neural signals throughout the body and even thinking endurance was selfexplanatory and the system information only confirmed the present kai is assumptions the next characteristic stamina determined one is resistance to various injuries and the ability to recover from them that is to regenerate weirdly though the mind which by logic shouldve been pretty low he had never considered himself smart was almost doubled mind reflected all intellectual and mental abilities kai assumed that this characteristic had such a high value due to social reasons since there were no official educational institutions in this world there werent as many literate people here as there were on earth therefore in comparison to the local majority he was highly developed in this regard despite being in the body of a fourteenyearold boy at least he wasnt a complete loser the last characteristic displayed the amount of energy that could be used to perform various techniques in this world techniques were special abilities that allowed a person to use magic called martial arts it could be said that in this case the word technique was a synonym for the word spell kai suddenly felt weak he shouldnt have survived but since he had he shouldnt have remained conscious the mysterious force that remained with him after his soul had moved into the new body kept him alert only for ten minutes consciousness was slipping away from him and kai found himself floating in the darkness once more  in the meantime in one of the alleys where people were rarely seen about 300 feet away from a wounded man stood two figures a pretty girl of about eighteen was marching down the alley her thick brown hair was pulled back into a tight ponytail and her warm amber eyes were sparkling despite her graceful form her dress was rather plain she was holding the wrinkled hand of a grayhaired old man in spite of his age he kept his back straight and didnt lag behind his granddaughter time seemed to have had no power over him dressed in a long robe that only healers were allowed to wear he calmly walked forward grandpa i swear the girl said with concern you have to see it the resemblance is uncanny so what he asked in a deep voice you must understand julie that the past cant be changed i beg you just take a look she cried the old man only sighed after a couple of minutes they reached the illfated alley with a gutter what the old man saw made him freeze bitter sorrow filled his heart right there among the garbage and sewage lay a boy who was the spitting image of a person close to him of his grandson a grandson who had disappeared more than a year ago it cant be the old man whispered not believing his eyes i told you julie said unable to hold back tears could it be that he managed to return the old man was silent it was difficult for him a wise old man to believe in miracles the old man was silent it was difficult for him a wise old man to believe in miracles that is the old man fell silent having gotten closer julie was finally able to examine the boy her heart sank when she saw his wounds and broken hands sobbing she fell to her knees grandpa julie had no doubt that this was her younger brother she refused to believe that the heavens couldnt hear her and that she wouldnt be rewarded for months of suffering she wanted to believe that her missing brother had been saved having noticed the change in his granddaughter the old man quickly leaned forward and assessed the boy is injuries a doctor is temperament as well as the hope that this truly was his grandson didnt allow him to just stand by idly and watch grab his shoulders careful he began to instruct julie we need to get him to our clinic as soon as possible i do not know who has done this to him but if we do not act quickly he would not survive julie who had been helping her grandfather all her life quickly did as she was told with no hesitation she grabbed the boy under the armpits as carefully as possible the old man took the boy is legs and they lifted him together having quickly and carefully brought him to the clinic which was a part of their house they laid him on the bed removing and throwing away his dirty clothes having washed the boy the old man began treating him check out this novel on

warwick when i first announced my campaign to be the next senator for district 31 i was very excited about the fact that two strong and capable women were running for the same position
having strong smart and competent women leaders not only benefits the general assembly but benefits our district and all of rhode island senator erin lynch prata was and will continue to be that kind of leader whether for the remainder of her tenure as a senator or in her possible new role as a rhode island supreme court judge she worked hand in hand with the current leadership to accomplish their goals and i appreciate her role in codifying roe vs wade protections in ri her record of achievement speaks for itself
from the very beginning of my campaign ive shared my vision for rhode island based on equitable policies that bring forward the many voices of my district and ri im a prochoice democrat and have worked on womxn and family issues all my life when elected i will use the senate seat to further these issues while also being a champion of the people whether for climate justice a predictable path to a 15hour minimum wage or issues most important to the communities that i serve
i understand that some longtime supporters may be disheartened about the news of lynch prata leaving the senate to pursue a new way of public servicei want to assure you that i have heard your voices and have stood side by side with you during our fight for a woman is right to have autonomy over her own body i will carry your voices with me all the way to the state house
with lynch prata moving on with her career goals we know that a longtime establishment politician is running against us our vision for moving rhode island forward into a new era is about challenging the status quo and bringing needed change to smith hill this fall when the votes are tallied and the people have spoken we will see that our vision is the one that most energized our district
our campaign is active on social media our email is kendraandersonrigmailcom please feel free to email us any questions comments or concerns our website kendraandersonricom has more information about our campaign you can also reach me directly at 4012872809

1,"members of commission vii dpr ri and head of bph migas support the use of lng for railway fuel
palembang member of commission vii dprri h yulian gunhar and head of bph migas m fanshurullah asa and bph migas committee ahmad rizal made a working visit to south sumatra province in order to carry out the function of supervising the oil and gas sector one of the work visit agendas in south sumatra is monitoring and supervising the use of certain types of fuel quotas jbt or subsidized diesel for consumers using passenger and goods public railways at pt kereta api persero divre iii palembang thursday during the visit the director of facilities management of pt kereta api persero azahari
head of bph migas m fanshurullah asa on the occasion conveyed the subsidized diesel quota provided by bph migas to pt kai in was kl and the realization was or resulting in an overquota of in bph migas has provided a subsidized fuel quota for kai of kl if multiplied by the retail selling price of rp it is worth rp trillion explained ifan a greeting for m fanshurullah asa
to prevent the occurrence of overquota in the determination of the subsidized fuel quota is set every quarter for the first quarter the quota is set at kl and the realization is kl then for the second quarter it was increased to kl but due to the largescale social restrictions pspbb which had an impact on limiting train operations the realization was only kl for quarter iii the quota is the same as for quarter ii which is kl explained ifan
ifan further said that he had checked that there was a freight train for export coal that uses subsidized fuel based on field checks there are freight trains for export coal to china india vietnam malaysia and brunei transporting an average of million tons per month with fuel consumption of thousand klmonth or around rp billionmonth or billion a year said ifan
ifan hopes that the use of subaidi diesel oil can be replaced with liquified natural gas lng so that fuel subsidies can be more efficient in addition to cheaper lng prices the use of lng is also cleaner energy
responding to this member of commission vii dpr ri from the pdip fraction for the south sumatra pdip dapil h yulian gunhar supports and encourages the use of liquefied natural gas or liquified natural gas lng as a rail fuel to be immediately implemented in the commercialization stage
just as the fuel oil subsidy is only for the indonesian people at home to move the economy so the use of freight trains for export commodities is not appropriate to be given a fuel subsidy therefore i support the use of lng as a fuel for trains replacing the use of diesel oil explained gunhar
according to gunhar the plan to use lng as a railway fuel has started since which was marked by the signing of a memorandum of understanding between pt pertamina persero and pt kereta api indonesia persero pt kai on august this is to support the government program in the context of energy diversification by converting the use of fuel to gas furthermore h yulian gunhar said that the use of lng as a train fuel has been used in several countries such as the usa canada russia and india
based on the results of the ddf lng trial on the power train carried out by pt kai persero in witnessed by the head of the research and development agency of the ministry of energy and mineral resources showed a decline in consumption of diesel oil by lng supply can be supplied from bontang with isotanks via sea and land routes
in addition to saving fuel costs the use of lng also has several advantages including as a clean and economical alternative fuel encouraging the use of natural gas in the country reducing imports and subsidies for diesel fuel diesel fuel reducing pollution caused by diesel engine emissions and extending the period maintenance of diesel engines so that maintenance costs are reduced
after making a working visit to pt kereta api persero divre iii palembang head of bph migas and the team made a field visit to pt bukit asam tanjung enim muara enim regency to see firsthand the operation of the coal transporting train and also to review the process of refueling for trains at the tanjung enim vhs facility
