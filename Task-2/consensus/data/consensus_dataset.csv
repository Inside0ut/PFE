"payroll politics and the upcoming election
the ""double pay"" for certain government employees is a community polarizing issue and the way is it being handled by the administration is like a bull in the china shop on roller skates the sudden influx of ""emergency pay"" bills are being viewed by many nongovernment employees as politicians following the time honored tradition of catering to the largest organized voting bloc government employees
when the governor shut down the economy nearly 40000 employees from private companies were sent home with no compensation support even though many government agencies were closed as well deemed nonessential their employees were sent home at full ""administrative"" pay starting a polarizing fire
actions by government executives and politicians since then have only thrown more logs on the fire starting with the entire ""pacific stargate"" debacle which is the most egregious example of a bad example when the administration took very highly paid exempt managerial employees and put them into temporary positions declaring them ""essential front line workers"" making them eligible for the covid19 differential and potentially double pay the polarizing fire started
fanning the flames is the fact those high paid government executives doing low wage service sector jobs putting more than thirty low wage service sector people out of work leaving them without money food and hope
guam's attorney general poured gas on the polarizing fire with his assertion that the people on the front lines are not eligible for double play but those cutting payroll checks are eligible for double pay
all the politicians are working hard to prove their support for govguam frontline workers fixing the flaws pointed out by the ag while their nongovernment counterparts doing the same high risk jobs are left in the cold
the legislature needs to take a very hard look on the long range results of their actions as they propose legislation to clear up the confusion surround this issue
inconvenient fact one the main log feeding the ""polarizing fire"" is the fact that the number of government of guam people actually on the ""real front line"" is exceeded by the number of nongovernment people working at medical clinics hospitals grocery stores gas stations and restaurants who everyday find themselves in ""dancing close proximity"" to people who have or may have the covid19 virus where are the double pay bills for them
bill 36135 further tarnishes the image of public service by declaring that all government executives and other managers' eligible for the same double pay politicians all claim the real ""essential front line workers"" deserve
paying people on the real front line in this pandemic emergency like police fire emt's nurses and doctors extra compensation makes sense they are taking personal risks paying people like clerks accountants administrative assistants and other people not in ""dancing close proximity"" to people who have or may have the virus takes money away from being used for direct and genuine relief efforts meant for support of the tens of thousands of people financially devastated by emergency orders shutting down the island's economy
now i find myself confused as it appears that senator nelson is trying to have her cake and eat it two with two bills 357 and 358
bill 35735 appears to serve the needs and goals of adelup to make special people feel even ""more special"" by allowing them to receive double pay using cares act funding to pay for it so with bill 357 money meant to support a population hammered financially into desperate levels of poverty and food crisis by the governor's emergency orders to be diverted away from supporting people in dire straits to give even more money to government employees who never missed a paycheck
bill 357 will further divide the people into those who work for govguam and are special and those who don't so they aren't
in the meantime the lines at food distribution points get longer more people are begging on streets and intersections and crime levels are increasing as desperate people start doing what they need to do to feed their children
bill 35835 appears to address a lot of the ""essential employee"" identification problems that are polarizing the community by clarifying who essential employees are and setting a form of ""hazardous pay"" differential and while it is better for taxpayers than the ""double pay"" gravy train of the other bills some politicians are riding in advance of the elections it too fails to address the nongovernment ""essential"" employee compensation issues reinforcing the image of two classes of people government employees and the rest of us
inconvenient fact two as it was before the pandemic nearly 60 of guam's workforce were already living on poverty level wages not able to bank funds for an emergencies as they were barely surviving living from paycheck to paycheck
now those people have been without work without money and running out of food while government employees were sheltered from that storm in the meantime federal funds meant for assisting the people sat in government accounts for months while the administration pushed out cash advances to politically well connected businesses having cash flow issues
contrast how fast the administration and this legislature leap into the breach to partially fund the war claims payments in an effort to prevent michael san nicolas from getting any credit for the payments against how resistant the administration and this legislature to act with the same speed rolling out federal funds to the tens of thousands of unemployed service sector employees idled by the governor's emergency orders
for months federal funds sat in government accounts and food distribution efforts fell short of the need and ""unemployment assistance"" remains slow in rolling out people are getting desperate and politicians seem more concerned about taking care of the already ""taken care of"" government employees with little effort to take care of nongovernment employees with the same levels of urgency and action
inconvenient fact three now in addition to offering selected government employees double pay bill 35935 now offers additional extra 240 hours of leave benefits and ability to cash out half the extra leave to be paid for by taxpayers most of who are out of work and accruing no leave benefits
for some of the infamous ""pacific stargate"" crew members those extra double pay hours plus leave benefit hours could result in an additional compensation of 50000 or more all coming out of taxpayer pockets
the optics of this bill to nongovernment unemployed taxpayers appear that incumbent politicians are using the power of the public purse to pander for votes from government employees to protect themselves from challenges by political newcomers in front of what are expected to be hotly contested elections
in summary these bills collectively are branding the 35th legislature as the ""animal farm legislature"" as actions by senators continue along the lines of rule seven in george orwell's book ""all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others""
when you debate these bills remember you were elected to represent all of us not just some of us",1
"23 rebellious communists from the experience lived during the epidemic sign a collective platform for a new branch of social protection concerning the abolition of unemployment by professional social security and call to sign the petition the petition below attached on changeorg
unsubmissive communists
professional social security is now
partial unemployment must be replaced by ""professional social security""
the government has decided that it will no longer reimburse 100 of the wages of people on partial unemployment but only 85 except for the catering and hotel trades this decision can lead to a disaster hundreds of thousands of people risk losing their jobs
it is time to put in place a new right which guarantees the income of a person made unemployed until he is hired in a new job
the state replaced companies for two months to pay salaries this corresponded to both a social emergency and an economic requirement to avoid recession he must continue this assistance until a total resumption of activity
but it cannot replace salary payments on a longterm basis if we want to change the situation at this time of ecological and social crisis we must disconnect employment from capitalism or even emancipate employment from capital the proposal for a universal income which is put forward by social democracy is well below the stakes
this is why we propose the establishment of a new branch of social security professional security which makes it possible to ensure this income guarantee
more than ever this measure is essential covid 19 has highlighted the need for a reorientation of our economy modifying the production and consumption sectors creating new ones takes time probably ten years and to carry out this work it is necessary to secure the workers affected by these changes by giving themselves the adaptation time
the spirit of this ""professional social security"" proposal is in the ""common future"" program supported by jeanluc melenchon in the 2017 presidential elections it has also been a pcf proposal for years
this is the very term of the cgt proposal
la france insoumise adds to this the proposal for an enforceable right to employment for each citizen which would require the state to maintain the remuneration of unemployed employees until they obtain of a new job
this measure must be financed by the pooling of social security contributions and by a tax on financial assets transferred to social security capital must contribute to this measure of job sustainability
if we want to create a new world the time has come to build this new human right ""professional social security"" is for us the emblematic measure that makes it possible to break with neoliberal policies solely concerned with the search for maximum profit in the short term whatever the ecological and social cost
the simultaneous experience of the epidemic and partial unemployment for 8 million employees creates a unique opportunity to change the way we conceive of our relationship to work
we can no longer produce and consume as before this requires major changes a new international division of labor planning of needs relocated production modified work chains and the establishment of new industrial and commercial sectors respectful of both people and our ecosystem
to achieve these changes we must break with the financial logic that leads companies to always seek lower costs that is to say the reduction of the wage bill and unemployment to maintain the possibility of paying dividends to shareholders and it takes time time to implement the necessary economic changes and the training plans defined with the employees to allow both to save existing knowledge and knowhow and to acquire new ones time for everyone to be educated and trained for the jobs of tomorrow including those in the energy and digital transitions this time only a social intervention guaranteeing the remunerations will make it possible to give it
and this measure will make it possible to release the energies as the president says but this time good energies those of the people because the other lesson we can draw from these two months of epidemic is the ability of employees citizens to think of new forms of production and exchange
let us think of this massive commitment to the manufacture of masks which made up for the shortcomings of the state and the selfishness of the distribution giants who stored them to sell them
let us think of the employees of the luxfer gerzat factory the only european producer of medical oxygen cylinders who resisted its closure and demanded its nationalization
let us think of the caregivers who collectively knew how to completely reorganize the public hospital scuttled by the liberal plans of successive governments in order to be able to manage the epidemic
let is think of all those who have been able to create short networks of relationships between producers and the population to feed themselves and most often differently and better
this is what it is all about freeing up energies directed towards the general interest because if we want to create a new world it is only possible by having it built by all those who will live there which means entrusting them with the appropriate forms of power in the company as well as in the city
the professional social security measure for all this new branch of social protection by placing people and not profit at the center of work by protecting family income is for us signatories an emergency to begin to put ourselves at the right level of response to the social ecological and democratic crisis
our ambition to renew the spirit of ambroise croizat and the cnr national resistance council for the 21st century time is running out for us
we invite you to join us in this goal by signing the attached petition on changeorg

"ive been getting a lot of feedback from yesterday is commissioners court meeting a lot happened under the topics of public health property tax exemptions and vote by mail elections community impactkaty carried several key points that i made during the meeting and i want to give more information here also
on the county judge is public health emergency declaration i voted against extending this till june 10th because both our county auditor and our emergency management coordinator testified to the court that it is not a necessary designation for fort bend county the county judge has said that he needs to keep it in place for obtaining funding from federal and state sources but our experts testified that is not the case the reason that this vote ended up as a 32 split is because an emergency declaration allows the county judge to continue transacting business and spending money without court approval i dont see an overwhelming reason why the spending authority of the taxpayers money isnt already restored to the full commissioners court commissioner meyers joined me in this vote because he believes the same thing the people of fort bend county need the freedom to get back to normal as they see fit the county needs to start getting back to normal also
during this same discussion the commissioners also heard from hhs director dr jacquelyn minter she agreed with my assessment that the county needs to immediately reevaluate the use and cost of some of the countyrun covid19 testing sites two of our locations are dramatically underutilized dr minter said that the county is working to restructure resources and tests to mobile sites to go directly to areas that need them ill be sharing that information as soon as the schedule becomes available
on property tax exemptions the court voted unanimously to enact the maximum homestead exemption were allowed to grant under texas law the county is exemption represents a 20 tax break on the value of your home and an additional 100k tax break for property owners over the age of 65 and the disabled the explosion of property valuations from the cad this year make this exemption worth more than ever and ill continue to visit and ask more taxing entities in fort bend county to grant larger exemptions like the county does right now only the city of katy has the same maximum homestead exemption for property owners and most muds dont have any homestead exemption at all
on vote by mail elections i voted against the motion to support full vote by mail elections and commissioner meyers joined with me for another 32 split vote i still remember when president carter and his bipartisan commission stated in 2005 absentee ballots remain the largest source of potential voter fraud and i still believe that he is correct i also believe that both the texas supreme court and the us supreme court are going to put a halt to the attempt to expand vote by mail to the entire state of texas this year instead of focusing on the lawyers and courts on the theoretical your precinct 1 staff are working to come up with real solutions to the realworld priorities of voting this year more voting locations more elections workers more ppe and distancing at the voting locations if heb and walmart locations can handle thousands of people every hour so can our elections that is where ill be focusing my efforts so we can do our best to get ahead and get people voting confidently in the upcoming elections",1

"Here’s how we make sure Bardstown Rd. survives COVID-19 Bardstown Rd is the heart of the Highlands and will only reach its maximum potential by burying the power lines allowing us to invest in a world class tree canopy. This will be especially critical as we deal with the long-term implications of COVID-19, rebuilding our local economy, and addressing climate change. Without a vibrant Bardstown Rd, the Highlands will suffer. We were already seeing hints of a decline and now ... with the challenges facing small businesses moving forward it is critical that we create an environment that gives them the best chance at success. This long overdue investment will pay for itself many times over by dramatically improving the quality of the street while increasing property values and thus taxes. It will create an even more vibrant street that attracts hundreds of thousands more visitors a year who will increase sales at existing businesses and also incentivize new businesses to move to the corridor. The traffic and lighting study is a much needed move in the right direction, but with the changed economic environment these updates are not enough to alter the long-term trajectory of the street or to ensure our neighborhood continues to thrive for the foreseeable future. While Bardstown Road was once the only “cool kid on the block”, we now face competition from many other areas of town in attracting visitors and businesses. Despite Bardstown Rd. being one of the most valuable corridors in the state generating many millions of dollars in tax revenue yearly, and clearly in need of investment, many will ask: “How can we afford this project?”. Phase 1 would run from Taylorsville Rd to Broadway, approximately 3 miles encompassing 400 properties assessed at nearly $200 million. Hundreds of small businesses occupy those properties, including at least 40 restaurants that avg. over a million dollars in sales each. Those restaurants alone yearly generate over $2 million in sales taxes, hundreds of thousands in occupational taxes and millions in other fees/taxes. A ten percent increase in property values of just the adjacent properties, an amount that understates the potential increase in value that will be provided by this investment in the streetscape, alone would generate several hundred thousands more a year in just property taxes. Additionally, with these improvements I estimate at least 200,000 additional visits to the street yearly generating ~$4 million in additional business sales and hundreds of thousands in additional tax revenue including sales taxes, occupational taxes, and parking meter revenue all added to Louisiville’s coffers. How does one even begin to quantify the value of having a world class street to the tens of thousands of people who live adjacent to it? And to the hundreds of thousands of people who use it, work along it daily and who will have a much better experience, be it the reduced temperatures and shade in summer or the esthetic improvement in winter, there is no doubt this is a dramatic improvement in the quality of the built environment. While that value will not be measured in cash, there is no doubt that our community will value it tremendously. Louisville Gas and Electric Company has publicly estimated the cost of burying the power lines at roughly $1,000,000 per mile. Lets conservatively double that cost and add another $6 million to plant and maintain around one thousand 3+ inch trees. The $12 million invested in this project will be almost doubled in just the increased property values! And this investment will generate millions of dollars a year in additional taxes, dramatically improve the experience of all those who use the street, attract many more visitors, and ensure the success of the Bardstown rd and the Highlands for generations. The most valuable investments we can make as a community are ones that improve the quality of life for existing citizens and support existing businesses. Keep in mind we spend exponentially more than the cost of this project on convention centers, luxury hotels, sports stadiums, and widening our interstates, all without even batting an eye. We have all enjoyed the cleaner air and lack of traffic during the shutdown and now that we understand more clearly the value of curbing vehicle and industrial pollution, we can never go back. We must recognize the world and city have changed and prioritizing investments that improve public health and create more livable and enjoyable spaces must be our community’s priority moving forward.

"“People shouldn’t need a CLASS to get organized. You just pick up your stuff.” I hear these kinds of comments all the time, and while I know they are generally meant to be encouraging and helpful, I’m going to stand on my soapbox for a moment and explain why I STRONGLY disagree. The fact of the matter is that all of us are learning and growing. Getting out of overwhelm comes naturally to some people. Other skills come naturally to other people. Saying that classes for organization shouldn’t exist is like saying classes for ANYTHING shouldn’t exist. For example... “You shouldn’t need parenting classes. Just set rules for your children and make sure they obey them.” Or “You shouldn’t need business classes. Just create a product that people need and sell it—in large quantities.” Or “You shouldn’t need fitness or nutrition classes. Just move your body and eat healthy foods.” Maybe if you were born knowing everything—and if you effortlessly got all the results you’d ever dreamed of achieving--you wouldn't need further education. But I’m not that person. And I’ve never met that person. I personally participate in courses (some paid, some free) every single month. I listen to podcasts. I read books. I interview people I admire and ask for their advice. I attend conferences. I work with coaches. It’s because I want to get better, I see my weaknesses, and I know I have untapped potential. I believe we all do. Organization WASN’T my strength for most of my life. I grew up in clutter, I rarely had friends over, and I generally felt embarrassed about the mess in my home. But because I took classes and read books and learned from others who had figured it out, I was able to transform my life—and give my children that same gift. My personal mission is to help people who are overwhelmed—who are drowning in piles of clutter, and who feel like something is “wrong” with them—to finally get out of that cycle. To finally have peace of mind. To finally look around their homes and offices and say, “Wow. I think I’ve got this.” HUNDREDS of thousands of people have already participated in our free training (and it truly is FREE), and the testimonials and thank you notes come in--Every. Single. Day.

"There was a time in my life when I wasn’t happy. I was overweight. And I drank too much. And I worried all the time. I worried about losing weight: what if this exercise plan doesn’t work? What if it’s too hard? I worried about drinking: what will people think if I’m not drinking? How will I have fun? Mostly I worried about my future: what if I can’t achieve my goals? → That’s when I realized that the act of worrying was actually PREVENTING me from taking positive action. I was stuck in the very place I was worried about - staying overweight, drinking too much, and being unhappy. The realization that worrying kept me stuck in the thing I was worried about shifted EVERYTHING for me. I developed a 4-step process to stop worrying and start taking action. As a Master Coach, I’ve helped thousands of people use these steps to shed their worries. And I want to do the same for you. Click the link below for a special 10-minute coaching session with me on the 4 steps to help you stop worrying...and start creating the life you’re meant to create.",1

"At the River I Stand This Documentary Explains AFSCME’s Place in the Civil Rights Movement In 1968, 1,300 sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee – members of AFSCME Local 1733 – risked everything for dignity and respect on the job. They went on strike, protesting poverty wages and degrading working conditions, demanding both economic justice and racial justice. They were asking not just for recognition of their union, but recognition of their humanity. They marched in the streets with a simple but powerful slogan: “I AM A MAN.” Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. came to Memphis to express his solidarity. It was there, on April 4, that he was assassinated as he stood on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel. This movie, “At The River I Stand,” produced in 1993, tells that story – the story of the Memphis sanitation strike, a story of fearlessness and resilience in the face of long odds, a story that still inspires us to take action for justice. On the 50th anniversary of these events, thousands of people are traveling to Memphis to remember this extraordinary moment in American history. We will rally and march. We will hear from some of the original strikers. We will commemorate Dr. King’s “Mountaintop” speech, delivered at Mason Temple the night before his death. It’s all a part of an initiative launched by AFSCME and the Church of God in Christ called I AM 2018. But the initiative is more than a reflection on the past. Its goal is to connect the strike and Dr. King’s struggle to important issues and challenges we still confront half a century later. It is about continuing to fight for the freedom of all working people. So, as part of I AM 2018, we are training organizers and activists, educating and mobilizing thousands of people at the grassroots, and building a sustained movement that advances labor rights, civil rights, economic rights and human rights. I AM 2018 isn’t just a commemoration; it’s a call to action. But to know where we’re going, we have to understand where we’ve been. “At the River I Stand” is a movie about an important moment in our nation’s history and AFSCME’s role in it.",1

"With the most recent election results reported out of Contra Costa and Alameda Counties, it has become clear that the top-two candidates have been set and we are moving on to the General Election. I wanted to take a moment to reflect on how far we’ve come since I first entered the race — This past year has been one of the most incredible of my life. We went from the despair of Trump's devastating electoral college victory to launching a successful grassroots powered campaign ... for Assembly District 15, and it meant the world that my baby daughter was able to squirm, crawl, then walk along for much of it. The entire time, we made clear that resistance meant not only standing up to Donald Trump -- though we resolved to do that -- but talking to the voters of the East Bay about how to translate our progressive values into results that will move our communities and all of California forward - and make us an example for the rest of the country. Together we can ensure that California is a beacon of progressive governance. To do that we must fund our public schools by investing in our students and teachers. We must tackle our housing and homelessness crisis by building new homes and protecting against displacement. We must invest in transit and other sustainable transportation solutions. We must protect the environment, demonstrate the courage to stop gun violence, and welcome immigrants by defending their rights and place in our society. I would like to thank the over 100,000 people who voted in this primary - there is no more significant act of citizenship. I would like to thank the tens of thousands of people who joined our campaign by drawing a line next to my name. I would like to thank the thousands of people who participated in and supported this campaign by hosting or attending organizing house parties. And I would like to thank the over 500 people who actively volunteered with our campaign. I'm humbled and grateful. Finally, I would like to thank the other 11 other candidates for Assembly District 15. It takes immense courage to put your name on a ballot, courage that was hard on some days to summon myself. It was often observed that there was an embarrassment of riches when it came to folks running for this seat. That's an understatement. My fellow candidates and I have spent careers investing in our communities, our state, our country, and our broader fight for social justice and progressive values. The campaign was rich in meaning because of the richness of experience represented on the ballot. This district has always sent leaders to Sacramento, women and men who have led the fight in the legislature for equity and justice. The incredible insights and contributions of all the candidates over the past year have helped ensure we'll get just that in our eventual representative. Congratulations to Jovanka Beckles for advancing to November's general election. I look forward to a constructive and healthy debate on the issues. # AD15",1

NOW, join Matt Fraser LIVE for an uplifting group reading as he helps you connect with loved ones that have passed. About Matt Fraser: It all began in New England where Matt was born and raised. He was no different than any other child although he was born with “The Sight”. A psychic gift that was passed down from his maternal grandmother. The signs occurred very early. At just the age of four, Matt began seeing and hearing the departed in his bedroom at night. As a child this extraordinary gift frightened him, forcing him to push it away until his teen years. It appeared that he was already starting to be prepared for the incredible journey that laid ahead of him. Matt has always felt the need to help others. That is why in his early teenage years he became an Emergency Medical Technician working in the City of Boston. He had kept his gift a secret for years, fearing that he would not be accepted. It wasn’t until Matt looked deeper into his abilities, that he understood being a medium was his calling and life’s mission. In the years that followed, Matt would become one of the world’s most respected Psychics. Now, as an adult, Matt is doing just that. Through his sold out live events, to the his one-on-one sessions and books, Matt is on a personal mission to reconnect as many people as possible with their loved ones in Heaven. He has answered questions for thousands of people with his incredible psychic gift and has been a highly sought after guest appearing on major media outlets across the nation including: NBC Morning News, CBS Radio, Fox News, Coast to Coast, The Herald News and more due to his uncanny abilities. Today Matt continues his mission not only to share his gift with others, but also to provide assistance within the community through various fundraisers and benefits. Matt sits on the Board of Directors of Forever Paws Animal Shelter and The National Cultural Diversity Awareness Council, two nonprofit organizations in New England. Matt passionately believes that his job as a psychic medium is not only to help those connect with their loved ones, but to help inspire and encourage others to embrace and be thankful for all the blessings that life has to offer.",1

"Volcán de Fuego Relief Project: We are sharing photos from Sexto Sol's effort two weeks ago to assist the survivors of the terrible catastrophe caused by the volcano. Background: On June 3rd, Volcán de Fuego, just outside the city of Escuintla,Guatemala erupted without warning. In a matter of minutes, thousands of people in poor communities in the path of the lava and rock had to race for their lives. Whole communities were completely destroyed and there was great loss o ... f life. Thousands of people lost homes, land, their livelihoods and their communities in one terrible sweep. But the worst thing was that they lost what is most precious - their children, their spouses, parents, or other family members. Children were orphaned. The Guatemalan Consul in Mexico informed us that it is estimated that 1 million people were affected. Hundreds of families are now surviving in shelters administered by the local Catholic Church. People are collecting food and such and delivering it to the shelters. This is the people helping their fellow Guatemalans. But while they are receiving shelter and food, the survivors are dealing with the severe emotional distress that such extraordinary situations evoke. This causes physiological changes that can become chronic over time. Sexto Sol responds to disaster situations by providing treatments for the emotional distress, fear and PTSD. We do this to give people relief and to help prevent illness that results from chronic, extreme stress. In this case we offered auricular acupuncture, a protocol that we have been able to provide to populations affected by natural disaster since 2006 thanks to the collaboration of the Acupuncture International Brigade after Hurricane Stan. The needles were donated to Sexto Sol in 2014 when a major earthquake caused damage in the Sierra Madre and we assisted people affected then. On this trip we were able to provide about 200 treatments. People asked us to stay longer so that they could bring friends and family for help or to return if we can. Our deep thanks to people who have contributed in the past for our disaster relief work and to our friends at the Nagata-Yamauchi Educational Fund. We are considering returned to train local doctors and social workers how to provide this and other treatments.

"How A Dangerous, Slaughter Bound Horse Was Transformed Into A Faithful Companion. Dear Fellow Fair Horse Owner, I’d like to share a story with you. It’s the story of a woman and her horse, and it was very nearly a tragedy. I remember that day in particular because the scorching mid-July Texas heat was in full effect, setting a new historic high. It was one of those days when the cows spent the entire day hiding in the shade of the nearby live oak trees to escape the heat, not moving a muscle until the sun set. I was putting on a Steady Horse Clinic at my ranch, and it had gone really well. A lot of people made real breakthroughs in the way they communicated with their horses, and I was pleased and felt proud of putting in a day's worth of hard work. At the end of the clinic, when everyone was packing up their trucks and getting ready to head home, a woman approached me who I had never met before. She had come with her friend who was participating in the clinic, and I hadn’t had a chance to talk with her. Well, when she approached me to introduce herself, I noticed immediately that one of her arms was in a sling. She said her name was Linda and that she wanted me to train her horse for her. Linda went on to tell me that her horse, Midnight, was the love of her life. She had rescued him as a skinny starving yearling and they had grown to love each other. Midnight was a quarter horse gelding, and at the time was 5 years old. Like any new colt, Linda had sent him off to a trainer to get started. The first time Midnight came back from the trainer, Linda described it as “a dream.” It felt like everything was going great… until a few weeks later when Midnight slowly stopped responding to her commands. Easy things like catching him and getting him to respect her space started becoming huge chores and full of drama. So off she sent Midnight to another trainer to “fix him”... and the same thing happened. He was perfect… for a few weeks… and then the bad habits started to rear their ugly heads again. Linda and Midnight were back to fighting over the simplest problems… and this time Midnight was bucking randomly and without provocation. Over the years, Linda sent Midnight to FIVE different trainers, went to over a dozen clinics, but always got the same results… Just a few weeks before, Linda had gotten Midnight back from a trainer out in North Texas. As usual, he had behaved well after getting home, but a week later she was out on a trail ride with a few friends, out in a beautiful open pasture when the craziest thing happened. Out on the trail, for no reason whatsoever, Midnight started bucking like crazy. Linda tried desperately to stay on him, but it wasn’t enough. He threw her. Linda landed hard, breaking her arm in two places. But Linda’s arm wasn’t the only thing broken in the fall. Her pride and confidence and trust in Midnight had been shattered as well. All she had wanted to do was join her friends on trail rides, but every time she went out riding with her friends, she felt like a burden to them because they ALL had to turn around any time Midnight started acting up. Now, sitting on the dirt, cradling her broken arm, all of her worst fears had come true. She told me that after that last fall that sent her to the hospital, her husband was so mad that he threatened to take Midnight out into the pasture and just put him down. “He said he loved Midnight as much as I did, but that he loved me more and wanted me to be safe,” Linda told me. After some arguing, she managed to talk him down, but her husband told her that if Midnight hurt her one more time that he would take him to the Sale Barn and auction him off. The thought of sending him away and knowing where the horses go afterwards was too horrible to contemplate. She knew that wasn’t an option. So Linda did what she always did and went to another clinic, my Steady Horse clinic. This time, unable to participate because of her broken arm, so she audited it. At clinic’s end, she approached me, and there we were were. Shortly after we got to talking she told me her story and finally asked me the big question. She said “Can you fix Midnight for me? I don’t care what it costs I just want to see my boy fixed.” On that hot summer Texas day, I looked Linda right in her eyes and said... “Linda, I’m not going to train your horse.” As soon as the words were out of my mouth, I saw her hopes crushed. Sadness washed over her entire face, and her eyes started to fill with tears. “But that’s a good thing!” I said with a big smile, hurrying to finish what I wanted to say. I went on, “Here’s the deal Linda. I can take your money, and sure when you come out to visit Midnight he will behave perfectly, but I can promise you that as soon as he gets back home with you he will go right back to his old ways.” I’ve been told that Albert Einstein said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results. I told Linda the reason why she was having issues with Midnight is because he didn’t know that he could trust her in stressful circumstances. You see, there are certain exercises that you can perform with your horse right before you start your ride each time that reinforces to them that they can trust you as their confident leader. It’s a simple but effective reminder. Think about it this way, I told her: When a pilot sits down in the cockpit and prepares for a flight, they take the extra time to check everything and make sure there are no problems with the plane. And aren’t we glad they do! That’s why there are so few plane accidents, because they make sure everything is okay on the ground before going up! And you have to do the same thing with Midnight. Before every ride, there are things you should do to make sure there are no problems and to ensure a safe ride. I said, “Linda, here’s what I’m going to do, I’m going to give you a copy of my Gradual Desensitizing DVD, and I want you to go home and watch it from start to finish. Then I want you to go out and do the exercises with Midnight and tell me how it goes.” (You can grab the same DVD for 75% off + free shipping. Just click here for the special link: http://get.steadyhorse.com/desensitizing ) That weekend was really busy for me, with back-to-back clinics happening. I had to get ready for the the next clinic, so I said a quick goodbye and we both went our separate ways. Well, fast forward two months. I receive a phone call from a number I didn’t recognize. Now I don’t normally answer random phone numbers because of all the spam out there, but for some reason I decided to answer this call. Lo and behold, it was Linda! I didn’t recognize her voice at first because it was filled with happiness and excitement, much different than the sad lady who audited my clinic a few months earlier. She was over the moon! She had just gone away on a weekend horseback riding retreat and had zero issues. Everything from loading Midnight into the trailer, to going through a nearby creek, Midnight performed perfectly. “You were right!” Linda said happily. “I went straight home and watched the DVD you gave me from start to finish, and then once it was over, I watched it all over again! I never realized that this entire time I had thought there was something wrong with Midnight… when in fact it was me all along!” She even went on to tell me about another minor incident on a recent trail ride when a large tree branch had fallen down during the ride, making a terrible noise. The noise was so unexpected and loud that three of the other trail riders’ horses started to buck and freak out, but Midnight remained perfectly calm. She said “I did exactly as you told me on the DVD in Lesson 7, where you showed us the breathing technique you use to get our horse to draw confidence from us… and it worked perfectly! “It worked so well that the other ladies I was riding with were completely shocked that Midnight didn’t move a muscle I didn’t ask him to! “And then I did something I’ve never done before in my life,” she told me. “I slowly got down, asked Midnight to stand still, just like you showed us on the DVD, and then proceeded to show all the other ladies the exact techniques and methods that I used to show Midnight he could trust me in times of panic. “They were completely blown away at how well it worked. “The rest of the day was a dream, and the entire rest of the weekend I was just beaming with pride! Usually I’m the one that causes the group to turn around… but now I was the one who taught the group how to move forward!” Linda told me that in that moment she felt like the happiest woman in the world! You see what Linda discovered, and what I want to share with you, is that you can have the best, most “lovey-dovey” relationship with your horse and still have a bad time when it comes to saddling up and getting your horse to really trust you. Over the years we’ve lost what it really means to be a true horseman. To have a real relationship with our horses where they trust as us their confident leaders. I’m not talking about having a dull, broken, “bomb-proof” horse. I’m talking about becoming the leader your horse can look to and instantly trust that you have their back through even the most stressful situations. A companion that you can go on exciting adventures with, explore new terrain, and know that whatever uncertainty lies ahead, that you will get through it together. Doesn’t that sound awesome? Here’s the thing… I got to thinking about how Linda’s experience wasn’t all that different from a lot of my students. I’ve met hundreds of people just like her who are struggling to have a meaningful relationship with their horse. And I started wondering... What was the most impactful thing that I could do help as many people as possible? And then it hit me… What if I made the Gradual Desensitizing DVD as accessible as possible by providing a massive discount? By doing that, anyone who wanted to improve their relationship with their horse and become their confident leader would have the exact same opportunity that Linda had. SO that’s what I’ve decided to do! Why you ask? Because I got to thinking about how many people I’ve worked with who are just like Linda, and have suffered so much heartbreak, or haven’t really had a relationship with their horse, or who have suffered severe injury because of their horse. And because of that, for a VERY limited time only I’m offering my Gradual Desensitizing DVD for 75% off with FREE Shipping.. To grab your copy, head over to",1

"Can you travel back in time? #Annexember If we could it would be most likely that we stopped the outbreak of the #Coronavirus, known as #COVID19, on time. What if, with a simple interference, we could not change the actions in the past, but we could be capable to reduce the consequences by allowing us self to make future changes and therefore accepting that we would travel back in time, in the future! What, wait….how? Let me start by putting all the problems into perspective ... which have an enormous weight on our social system: Schools stop teaching. School exams are being cancelled, a whole generation will learn less. Productionlines of factories which do not operate. Complete economic sectors of the economy are being stopped and will face a rough time. This list can go on and on, but the most critical of all in this situation: hundreds of millions of people are being affected by this! Not only in Belgium or The Netherlands, we we can slightly imagine what it could mean for our economy. But look only at the United States, 80 million people face a financial crisis for sure, and it’s a low estimate! Whithout further explaination it seems very clear that almost every country in the world will be hit like never before in case of a disaster or war. This asks for drastic measurements that goverments and unions are taking, but, can those actions ever be sufficient to turn he tide of this disaster or at least limit the consequences? I don’t think so. This could only be done with a measurement that is never been taken, a measurement that need worldwide support without any examption and with a measurement of which the impact shall be greater than the suffering we need to undergo now! What is my suggestion? Why don’t we say on the 30th of november: “Tomorrow we’ll start on the 1st of #Annexember…” that’s right, one month extra, once. Let’s allow ourselves this extra month in 2020 en in this way change our future past. Schools will have the opportunity to repeat important lessons, factories and industries can bring down a part of the loss on a competitive way, as well as all the business figures over 2020. Banks will receive extra payments for loans which make it easier to overcome the backstand they are facing now. Our political system will get the opportunity to work on projects that are being stopped and will help succeed in their goals and timeframes. In my opinion it would help our worldwide society to release our belt a little…maybe still not comfortable, but enough to breath normally. I am sure by now a lot of people have second thoughts about this idea, and to me, honestly, that makes sense. Once I was in a situation on the road where I needed to hurry to a meeting, but I had to go to the bathroom as well. I could choose to stop at a gas station and take the risk of being late, or I could drive like this…and if there was an accident on the way..I certainly would not take part at that meeting. My concerns where set aside…because at this moment, is there a better alternative to stop the flood of economic force of the majority and personal suffering as we are facing now? #annexember our 13th month that we need to claim! Are you in? Copy this message on your timeline and let’s see how far we can get to a serieus social solution! # Annexember # imagine # whatif # coronavirus # covid19 by Jacques Geense.",1

Don’t allow the actions of one officer dictate a hatred towards the police in general. Please don’t allow the actions of one police officer dictate the highest level of respect we should continue to show law enforcement.

"He died. His soul had left his body. The last moments of his life were being replayed in his head over and over again until darkness absorbed them. There was nothing but darkness. The hero of the underground ring was stabbed to death by the one to whom he had entrusted his heart. He was capable of winning even the most difficult fights, but couldn’t defend himself against his beloved. He could no longer see, or hear, or feel. He couldn’t be. For some reason, he was still aware of himself, his past, and even his personality. The only thing he had forgotten was his name. It seemed to him that he had never had one, but his memories claimed otherwise. He had no idea how much time he had spent in that darkness. Maybe an hour, maybe a day, a year, or perhaps even an eternity. It could’ve even been a single moment. Time didn’t exist there. Gradually, something began to change, and he felt distinctly alive. Like a newborn, he became suddenly aware of his existence. He opened his eyes. At least, he tried to open them. His left eyelid was swollen and it wouldn’t move, but he managed to open his right one with a lot of effort. At first, everything was blurry, but after a while, his vision became a little clearer. The man saw endless, wide skies. Spread above him was a clean and calm ocean of blue. There wasn’t a single cloud, only a majestic light. His hearing came back right after his vision. It happened rather abruptly. The man heard a stream gurgling somewhere nearby, carrying muffled voices. Next came the sense of smell — the pungent aroma of sewage and feces hung in the air. At the same moment, he tasted something bitter that reminded him of metal. There was blood in his mouth. The last to recover was the sense of touch. The man finally felt his own body. Hands, legs, torso, head... It all seemed so unusual after his soul had spent some time in the darkness. A forgotten feeling... He didn’t want to move, and even if he had tried, the pain would’ve impaled him on the spot. Even lying motionless, the man felt his hands burning with pain, and blood oozing from the wound on his leg. Water mixed with blood was touching his skin, making it sting and itch. His breathing was weak and irregular and his chest hurt. The man had no desire to do anything. Looking at the endless skies with one half-open eye, he reflected. He was thinking about why he was here. Why had life given him another chance? What for? Pain... His soul couldn’t find peace even after death. How sad… Then his memories started coming back. Someone else’s memories began to merge with his — memories of the previous owner of the body he had found himself in. He, too, had recently died, allowing him to be reborn. His story was also a tragic one. He was only fourteen when he was mutilated, killed, and thrown into a ditch because of a petty theft he had committed so as not to die of hunger. His family had moved to this city not long before that event occurred. An epidemic broke out, the nature and origins of which remained unknown, annihilating almost a tenth of the local population. His parents had died a year earlier and left him a small shack and some money. He would’ve continued to live on, but he was unfortunate enough to have come across a member of one of the city’s ruling families. Broken hands and death were an unjust punishment. Strange how the man wasn’t at all bothered by that right now. There was no anger or hatred in him, only boundless apathy and a drop of incomprehensible joy. The man finally remembered a name. It wasn’t his, however. No. It belonged to the previous owner. But it was still a name. His name was Kai. Kai Arnhard. For some reason, he was quite pleased with this. Suddenly, Kai was filled with a strange sensation, and incomprehensible lines of text showed up before his eyes, surprising him. Life and emotional activity discovered... Canceling Uninstall System... Restoring the structure... Resuming work... The system has been restored and is ready for use... Test opening of the options menu to check the mind of the carrier... Stats Age: 14 Race: human Status: mortal Stage: none Level: none Characteristics • Power: 0.24 • Speed: 0.49 • Endurance: 0.3 • Stamina: 0.5 • Mind: 2.1 • Energy: 0.67 Abilities None Paths Unknown What’s this? A thought flashed through his shocked mind. Having regained focus, he managed to dig out the memories that might hold answers to his questions. As it turned out, everyone in this world had such a System. Kai had no doubts that he was now a part of a completely different world, and that he was no longer on Earth. However, he wasn’t sure how much martial arts masters like him were worth here. The System appeared in people at the moment of their birth and remained there until they died. Apparently, having considered Kai dead, it began uninstalling itself, but the presence of another soul stopped it. Only one thing remained unclear: How and why did he enter the corpse and for what reason had the System started functioning again? What had stimulated it? The past Kai knew little about it, as he was from a poor and illiterate family. But the new Kai, who had lived on Earth for a long time, guessed that it was something like a neural interface — a computer placed in a person’s brain that millions of people from his world could only dream about. The little knowledge that the past Kai did have, he had gained from the general information window of the System, and rumors that he had heard from his parents. As the present Kai understood it, the System scanned the characteristics of the body at birth and displayed them in the brain in the form of numbers. It performed the same action whenever any stat changed. The System was constantly monitoring them. They were calculated in relation to the average value of the physical abilities of a twenty-year-old human, with a score of one being equivalent to that value. Kai’s stats were extremely low right now, even for his age. The reason behind it was his crippled and beaten-up body. Present Kai re-read the information window, not wanting to rely only on past Kai’s memories. Power was responsible for all manifestations of physical strength, and speed for the speed of muscle contraction, transmission of neural signals throughout the body, and even thinking. Endurance was self-explanatory and the System information only confirmed the present Kai’s assumptions. The next characteristic — stamina — determined one’s resistance to various injuries and the ability to recover from them. That is, to regenerate. Weirdly, though, the mind which, by logic, should’ve been pretty low — he had never considered himself smart — was almost doubled... Mind reflected all intellectual and mental abilities. Kai assumed that this characteristic had such a high value due to social reasons. Since there were no official educational institutions in this world, there weren’t as many literate people here as there were on Earth. Therefore, in comparison to the local majority, he was highly developed in this regard despite being in the body of a fourteen-year-old boy. At least he wasn’t a complete loser... The last characteristic displayed the amount of energy that could be used to perform various techniques. In this world, techniques were special abilities that allowed a person to use magic, called martial arts. It could be said that in this case, the word technique was a synonym for the word “spell.” Kai suddenly felt weak. He shouldn’t have survived, but since he had, he shouldn’t have remained conscious. The mysterious force that remained with him after his soul had moved into the new body kept him alert only for ten minutes. Consciousness was slipping away from him and Kai found himself floating in the darkness once more. *** In the meantime, in one of the alleys where people were rarely seen, about 300 feet away from a wounded man stood two figures. A pretty girl of about eighteen was marching down the alley. Her thick, brown hair was pulled back into a tight ponytail, and her warm, amber eyes were sparkling. Despite her graceful form, her dress was rather plain. She was holding the wrinkled hand of a gray-haired, old man. In spite of his age, he kept his back straight and didn’t lag behind his granddaughter. Time seemed to have had no power over him. Dressed in a long robe that only healers were allowed to wear, he calmly walked forward. “Grandpa, I swear!” the girl said with concern. “You have to see it! The resemblance is uncanny...” “So what?” he asked in a deep voice. “You must understand, Julie, that the past can’t be changed!” “I beg you, just take a look!” she cried. The old man only sighed. After a couple of minutes, they reached the ill-fated alley with a gutter. What the old man saw made him freeze. Bitter sorrow filled his heart. Right there, among the garbage and sewage, lay a boy who was the spitting image of a person close to him. Of his grandson. A grandson who had disappeared more than a year ago. “It can’t be,” the old man whispered, not believing his eyes. “I told you,” Julie said, unable to hold back tears. “Could it be that he managed to return?” The old man was silent. It was difficult for him, a wise old man, to believe in miracles. The old man was silent. It was difficult for him, a wise old man, to believe in miracles. “That’s...” The old man fell silent. Having gotten closer, Julie was finally able to examine the boy. Her heart sank when she saw his wounds and broken hands. Sobbing, she fell to her knees. “Grandpa!” Julie had no doubt that this was her younger brother. She refused to believe that the Heavens couldn’t hear her and that she wouldn’t be rewarded for months of suffering. She wanted to believe that her missing brother had been saved. Having noticed the change in his granddaughter, the old man quickly leaned forward, and assessed the boy’s injuries. A doctor’s temperament, as well as the hope that this truly was his grandson, didn’t allow him to just stand by idly and watch. “Grab his shoulders. Careful,” he began to instruct Julie. “We need to get him to our clinic as soon as possible. I don’t know who has done this to him, but if we don’t act quickly, he won’t survive.” Julie, who had been helping her grandfather all her life, quickly did as she was told. With no hesitation, she grabbed the boy under the armpits as carefully as possible. The old man took the boy’s legs, and they lifted him together. Having quickly and carefully brought him to the clinic, which was a part of their house, they laid him on the bed, removing and throwing away his dirty clothes. Having washed the boy, the old man began treating him. Check out this novel on Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0874S6C1S",1

Welfare disables millions and millions of people, and it makes America into a dangerous place. Welfare brings unwanted and lazy people wherever it is used. Welfare directly opposes the laws of God and nature. Government handouts give people something that they have not worked for, and it teaches them to hate their life and those who are productive. In many ways only criminals accept government handouts. Furthermore, anyone who takes a government handout becomes subservient to the government. Statistically and historically, governments use welfare and handouts to trap people and to take their freedoms away. To see the direction that a country will go, all you have to do is see the percentage of people who are on welfare, the higher the percentage, the worse off that country will be. It is appalling and a disgrace that America uses the evil weapon of welfare. Thank you,",1

"NRLN PRESIDENT’S FORUM: #2 HOLES IN THE SAFETY NET - MEDICARE This is the second of two NRLN President’s Forum messages that I’m calling “Holes in the Safety Net” because Medicare and Social Security have long been considered a “safety net” for older Americans. This message focuses on how important Medicare is to millions of people and the funding crisis that Medicare is heading toward. Medicare is the federal health insurance program created in 1965 for people ages 65 and ov ... er, regardless of income, medical history, or health status. The program was expanded in 1972 to cover people under age 65 with permanent disabilities. Medicare is administered by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS), a division of the U.S. Department of Health &amp; Human Services (HHS). Here are a few facts about Medicare based on CMS 2017 data and studies by the Kaiser Family Foundation. • 58.5 million Medicare beneficiaries with 38.3 million in original Medicare and 20.2 million in Medicare Advantage plans. • 10,000 Americans are turning age 65 every day and becoming eligible for Medicare. • 50% of Medicare beneficiaries have annual incomes below $26,200 and savings below $74,450. • 13% of Medicare beneficiaries are age 85 and older. • 4% of Medicare beneficiaries are in a long-term care facility. • Original Medicare Part A (hospital Insurance) helps cover inpatient care in hospitals, skilled nursing facility care; home health care and Hospice care. • Original Medicare Part B (medical Insurance) helps cover services from doctors and other health care providers; outpatient care; home health care; durable medical equipment and many preventive services. • Medicare Part C (Medicare Advantage) includes benefits and services covered under Part A and Part B; usually includes Medicare prescription drug coverage (Part D); run by CMS-approved private insurance companies under CMS rules; has a yearly limit on out-of-pocket costs and may include extra benefits and services that aren’t covered by original Medicare, often for an extra cost. • Medicare Part D (prescription drug coverage) helps cover the cost of prescription drugs; run by CMS-approved drug plans and may help lower prescription drug cost through its “donut hole” feature.

"- 52% of Americans wrongly believe Hitler came to power through force – when he was in fact appointed to his position. - 41% of young Americans believe that 2 million or fewer Jews were killed in the Holocaust.

"A New Attack on the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) Recently Senators Lindsey Graham, Bill Cassidy, Dean Heller, and Ron Johnson drafted an amendment to HR 1626 which was a bill passed by the Republican majority in Congress to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). This proposed amendment could be voted on by the Senate as early as next week. It has already been opposed in a letter drafted and sent to members of the US Senate by 5 Republican and 5 Democratic ... Governors. The bill would repeal the authority of states to cover Medicaid expansion adults as of September 1st, 2017. It would also add an option for states to require work as a condition for Medicaid eligibility for non-elderly adults who are not disabled or pregnant. It would convert Medicaid as we know it to a block grant program where funds would be provided to the states; however, states would receive far less funding than they do today. It would also prohibit federal Medicaid funding for Planned Parenthood clinics for at least 1 year. The amendment as drafted is extremely controversial since it would undermine the financial integrity of the Affordable Care Act, and it would result in millions of people no longer being able to afford their health insurance. It would eliminate the requirement for people to carry insurance, and it would also eliminate any subsidies to those who might otherwise qualify for financial subsidies under the ACA. Additionally, it would allow states to increase the cost of coverage for those with preexisting conditions, which could result in those persons no longer being able to afford to pay for health insurance. Last night, Jimmy Kimmel, a late night entertainer on ABC TV who has an infant son who was born with a congenital heart defect which required expensive surgery to survive, called Senator Bill Cassidy(R-Louisiana) out for being a sponsor of this amendment. Senator Cassidy had previously publicly stated that any amendment which he would introduce would have to pass what he called the “Jimmy Kimmel test,” which would mean that all children and infants would have the same opportunities that Kimmel’s son received. Last night, Kimmel expressed his disappointment that Cassidy had done just the reverse, and that the proposed amendment had failed in providing four essential components which he articulated as being necessary for any health insurance which are: 1. coverage for all; 2.no discrimination based on preexisting conditions; 3.lower premiums for middle-class families; and 4. no lifetime caps. Unfortunately, the proposed amendment fails the so-called “Jimmy Kimmel test” with a solid score of 0. Please contact your US senators and ask them to defeat this amendment.",1
"I Really, Really Want My Politics Back I thought American politics were divisive when I was young. Which they were. (Just watch a short video about civil unrest in America in 1968, like this one: http://m.rasmussenreports.com/…/1968_ball_of_confusion_a_ye… ) But if you look at a Liberal Republican from those times like Senator Edward Brooke (the subject of this week's repost of leading Liberal Republican politicians), or a conservative Republican of that time like President R ... onald Reagan (see the entry about Reagan in W.H. Brands' Reagan: A Life in the Bibliography With Commentary section of The Lone Liberal Republican website), you realize how much more extreme and uncivil American politicians have gotten since those days. Most of us, as passionate as we might be about politics today, really, really don't want to continue on our current political trajectory. Because like it did in the USSR (Russia) and Nazi Germany, such politics often ends really, really badly for millions of people. And while we thankfully aren't likely to end up in either of those places--though there are dozens of commentators on thewww.theloneliberalrepublican.com website from both ends of the political spectrum who think we will--we could end up living in a nation of disgruntled pessimists. Which is an utterly un-American world view...and a terrible future to bequeath to our children and grandchildren. Really really. Click the following link to read about Edward Brooke:",1

"hanbo is point of view the great plague of history the black death reshapes the rich and the poor in society
covid19 virus wuhan pneumonia history plague spanishflu rich and poor black death newcitizen council
the black death severely impacted the social structure and promoted the reallocation of resources in the subsequent epidemic the wealthy successfully protected their property and health while the poor were more likely to be affected and more likely to deepen inequality
like follow diverse views
the covid19 wuhan pneumonia new coronary pneumonia epidemic sweeping the world is still ongoing and it has been observed that the more vulnerable people are the greater the chance of harm for example in the united states the relatively disadvantaged africanamerican and latino ethnic groups have significantly higher mortality rates and this phenomenon has been repeated in history on the other hand the plague may also greatly affect social development the wellknown black death and even the rich and poor structure of europe for a long time
the substantial reduction of social activities for the purpose of epidemic prevention has limited impact on middle school teachers but small businesses cannot bear it for long this situation clearly points out that the impact of the epidemic on people with different socioeconomic statuses varies greatly in ancient times the disadvantaged indigenous society was often hit by infectious diseases diseases such as smallpox had destroyed many native american communities
the spanish flu of 1918 more than 100 years ago ravaged the world and killed tens of millions of people but the severity of the damage was significantly different among different ethnic groups in the united states the death rate of native americans is four times that of other ethnic groups in the era of racial segregation white patients went to white hospitals black patients went to black hospitals and white patients had a higher survival rate but it is not just racial disparities for example vulnerable american miners and factory workers have higher mortality rates as for oslo norway the death rate in the same city is 50 higher for the poorest than for the richest
it is a very clear fact that the epidemic will affect society and sometimes the impact is unexpectedly extensive and farreaching the black death which spread across europe from 1346 onwards is a stark example
the gap between the rich and the poor is an important indicator for understanding social conditions according to tax real estate and other information historians estimate that the proportion of the wealth of the top 10 of the wealthy people in the wealth of all people has continued to rise in italy for hundreds of years that is the wealth of the richest group of people the proportion of the total is increasing the only time the trend was reversed was more than a hundred years after the outbreak of the black death
in sabaudian in northwestern italy in 1300 the wealth of the top 10 accounted for 61 of the overall wealth after the outbreak of the black death it declined sharply for a short time and then gradually decreased to 47 by 1450 similar situations exist in southern france northeastern spain germany and england from these analyses it is inferred that the black death made the european society at that time more economically equal though the situation is different in eastern europe and russia further east
it is a historical norm that the rich are more likely to accumulate wealth but the black death can reverse the trend a major reason is that the black death wiped out too many people and the labor shortage was severe which made the wages of the survivors rise in addition the death of a large number of rich owners brought a large number of properties to the market and many heirs sold their land to farmers who had no property the plague severely impacted the social structure prompting a reallocation of resources
after the black death epidemic subsided the plague bacillus that caused the black death did not disappear and it came back every once in a while in italy however in the long run only the first black death had the effect of narrowing the gap between the rich and the poor and every subsequent plague over the centuries such as the two plagues of 1629 and 1656 seemed to have the gap between the rich and the poor has widened at least not narrowed
historians believe the reason is that people with resources found ways to protect their property and health in subsequent epidemics while poorer people were more likely to be hit these factors make it easier for previous epidemics to deepen social and economic inequalities
the proportion of wealth held by the rich continued to rise for hundreds of years it reached its peak in the early 20th century and it did not turn around until after 1918 perhaps it was related to the influenza epidemic at that time but it was also the end of the first world war at a time when the effects of war and influenza were rather indistinguishable
from a historical perspective the sacrifices and lessons of the epidemic may not necessarily lead to social progress but often bring negative impacts however if used properly it can also create a better future this epidemic is still developing and we are all involved in its outcome and impact

"Transparency builds Trust Recent articles in the Star and discussions on Political Smackdown about Cleveland County Schools illustrate why transparency is vital to the health of our school system. Talking with citizens around the county has made it clear that a lack of faith and trust in our school system is prevalent. Our current school board seems to prioritize optics, not “looking bad,"" over being open and honest with the public. Trying to sweep issues under the rug only ... makes matters worse. This is particularly true when students are potentially involved. Parents must be rapidly and factually notified about any situation that could affect their child. The old adage “Sunlight is the best medicine” is certainly applicable here. With 14,000 students, 29 campuses, and over 2,000 employees bad things are occasionally going to happen. When a problem arises every effort should be made to openly share relevant information. The only exception being personnel or student issues protected by confidentiality laws. In addition, I believe that all spending and budget reports should be made available in a digital standardized format for free access and download. This will comply with the Federal DATA Act of 2014. Citizens have the right to know how their tax dollars are being spent and the duty to hold elected officials accountable. Transparency builds trust. Trust is a foundational building block for a great school system. You deserve a school board that represents and reflects your values. Together we can make it happen!

I would like to introduce myself, my family, my career, and vision for the future of our Sheriff’s Office. In 1996, I graduated fro ... m UNH with a Bachelor’s degree in Sociology, and Minors in both Justice Studies and Psychology. Since graduating, I have called Strafford County home.

I was also fortunate to be able to give back to the Oyster River communities having coached for several years for Oyster River Girls Youth Soccer. I started my law enforcement career with the Somersworth Police Department - a career that allowed me to experience many specialized assignments, giving me one of the most diverse law enforcement experiences of any candidate. One of those assignments was being the first School Resource Officer at the Somersworth Middle School and teaching drug prevention as a DARE Officer. I spent time building relationships with students, parents, and faculty. I later worked as an investigator, specializing in sexual assaults and juvenile crimes. I also earned my first supervisory assignment as a Patrol Sergeant in 2005. It was a pleasure to serve the residents of Somersworth for over 10 years and it taught me the importance of building relationships and trust within the community. In 2007, I left to work for the Strafford County Sheriff’s Office as a deputy. I worked in the communities of Somersworth, Rochester, Barrington, Strafford, Lee, Durham, and Madbury. I performed duties for the courts, conducted investigations, helped with training, and implemented the first agency wide taser program. Again I focused on building strong relationships including businesses, landlords, residents, courts, attorneys, other county departments, as well as local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies. I learned that by working together we could provide the service our community deserves while fulfilling the statutory responsibilities of the office. For several years, I was assigned to the New Hampshire Joint Fugitive Task Force, collaborating with US Marshals and other law enforcement, to apprehend dangerous fugitives, keeping our communities safe. I have experience writing departmental policies as well as writing and managing grants. I made contributions to the first accreditation of the county dispatch center. I was the founding Commander of the Strafford County Drug Task Force, and have over 8 years of supervisory experience in law enforcement. I saw firsthand how the opioid crisis was deteriorating our communities, increasing drug related crime, and putting families into crisis. I believe we have a responsibility to curb the drug problem, but understand it must be a multi-faceted approach involving prevention in our schools, enforcement, and treatment. I will continue to partner with law enforcement agencies in Strafford County to provide the support they need to better our communities and focus on saving lives. I will continue to provide a safe environment in our courts, for the accused, and for individuals to seek justice consistent with the oath of office and that of a law enforcement officer. An oath that demands we treat all people with respect and dignity no matter their race, ethnicity, religion, gender, or sexual orientation. I’ll work with my staff to provide an efficient and high quality level of service. We will provide quality dispatching of emergency services for the communities we serve. I also believe we have a responsibility to the taxpayer. After retiring from the Sheriff’s Office in 2019 as a Lieutenant, I explored new opportunities and became a registered financial advisor. I will use that experience to help build a responsible budget and explore funding opportunities not already implemented by our agency. I will also avoid duplication of services already being utilized with success by our local police departments. I ask you to recognize my accomplishments, dedication, commitment, and vision for our Sheriff’s Office. Please partner with me to be your next Strafford County Sheriff and vote Brandon Drysdale for Strafford County Sheriff on September 8th.",1
"It’s a bittersweet victory. Our joy at the Supreme Court decision protecting the DACA program was only matched by the sorrow and pain of so many who have already been ripped away from their families. And there are so many more who still will be. The 800,000 DACA recipients have reason to celebrate, but we know they’ll come for us again. They’ll come for our brothers and sisters who are here under Temporary Protected Status. They’ll come for our mothers and grandmothers who ar ... e undocumented. They’ll tell us to go back to our country, back to our home - but this is our country, and this is our home. These are the communities and families we have made together alongside our friends and neighbors. The Supreme Court decision made it more clear that for now, DACA and TPS are just well-intended promises. Promises that Trump and future purveyors of cruelty and racism will again attempt to tear to shreds just as they try to tear our families apart. Join CASA in Action and fight to elect leaders who will fight for what’s right and enshrine DACA and TPS into law, and do so in the context of comprehensive and just immigration reform.

"I am happy to serve you as part of our community. I have lived in Conmee Township with my spouse for the past 36 years.

I have worked for accounting firms (Peat Mervick Thorne, Ernest and Young, Stille Sutton), daycares and examiner for the Ministry of Education. Presently, I am employed by the Lakehead District School Board as an elementary French Immersion tea ... cher. I have been involved in political committees at the region level and the provincial level. I was President of Parent Teacher Association (PTA), Treasurer for Northwest Ontario Trucking and Logging Association (NOTLA), Elementary Teachers of Ontario, Lakehead area (LETO), St. Theresa’s Women Group, Francophone Association (AFNOO), financial administrator for St. Augustine and St. Theresa’s parishes. I am soon coming to retirement and decided that it is time to give back to the community I love by allowing my name to stand for the position of Mayor of Conmee Township. As Mayor, I will be part of a team who together will review the financial and social activities of our community. We can review the present tax rate, as it seems to be grossly inflated compared to our neighbouring communities and the services they provide. The high taxes are impeding our growth and development. Together we can face these challenges and apply our knowledge to come up with a plan to curb our finances and enhance our situation. In the future, I would like to attract businesses and add social activities such as Welcome Wagon to make newcomers feel at home. It would also be advantageous to gather more often and discuss the major items that come to the table. I would welcome the opinion of everyone as we all have a vested interest in our township.

"As the November 6th date looms closer, many are starting to contemplate for whom they will vote. Many of my conservative counterparts feel particularly pained due to my involvement as a Republican nominee for County Council-At-Large. The elephant in the room (pun intended) remains my appearance. Over the past two years of campaigning, I have learned that many, especially the older generation, find a Harley Davidson riding, full-sleeved tattooed, bearded guy with an unconventi ... onal haircut, well…isn’t the conventional pick to sit on the dais of our county government. One thing I’ll never do is lie to you, and so the truth is that the looks and the whispers have bothered me at times. I know full well that the reality of life is that we judge books by their covers every day. Still, it is frustrating that people won’t take the time to learn about the character within because the cover is a little frayed. This isn’t anything new. The generational gap, and the misunderstanding that comes with it, repeats itself continuously. I am, by no means, unique in my plight to try and convince my forbearers to give me a chance even though I don’t seem to fit the mold they had in mind. I get it. Still, I must ask, how well has that mold treated Frederick County? I love Frederick. To be frank, the only thing I don’t like about it is that we have allowed our county government to become infiltrated with private, petty personal wars that have done nothing to move our county forward. In fact, I think it has done the opposite, it has hindered us. The visceral discord that occupies Winchester Hall is not reflective to a community that served as a “hospital town” during the Civil War and is home to over 900 non-profits. We embrace teamwork and collaboration to solve problems. Now, it’s time our government did the same. I want to be part of the team that chooses to change that culture. I have led under duress in a myriad of conditions: combat, emergency response, and the boardroom. I’ve gone from homeless and eating out of trash cans to founding Soldierfit, one of the fastest growing companies in America. I founded and helped to establish a thriving non-profit to combat veteran suicide. I’ve received awards for my leadership in every undertaking: Army, Fire Department, business community, and non-profit sector. Some say I have a proven track record of success. I say I have a proven track record of teamwork. With all the challenges facing Frederick, teamwork is what we need now more than anything. Nothing I have ever done did I do alone. Many in politics will say what they will accomplish. I’ve learned that I accomplish nothing by myself, but together we can achieve anything! The demands of our future are too great to elect people who wish to divide us. It is time to elect people who put an end to the division by refusing to be a divider. That is my pledge to you. I know that I look different. I know I may not be what you had in mind when you dreamed up a nominee. Just remember, many of your parents didn’t like Elvis when he showed up either. He was too risqué, too different. In the end though, he changed the way music was performed and by the time he was done, we realized that sometimes different is just what we needed. http://www.thetentacle.com/ShowArticle.cfm?mydocid=7529",1

And if you have, I believe that together we can change the world. Starting right now. I was born in Jerusalem, and raised mostly in Peru and in Mexico. When I was 15 my family moved back to Israel, and at 18 I was drafted into the Israeli army for three years of compulsory service. A year lat ... er, my unit was stationed on the Syrian border, and my job was to spend several hours each day alone on a watchtower, looking through a telescope across the barbed wire and the minefields, trying to spot any strange movements on the other side. One afternoon—I remember it was a cool, beautiful winter day—I suddenly had a thought that made me laugh out loud. I laughed because the idea was childish but also true, in that way that children have of recognizing the truth. A few months earlier, getting to know the guys in my unit, I'd realized gratefully that some of them would give me their last pair of dry socks if I ever needed them. But there were also a few who might steal mine if I wasn't careful. That image was on my mind that afternoon, when through the telescope I saw a group of Syrian soldiers playing a game of soccer across the valley that separated us. And instantly, something about the situation—that moment of play, their running around like kids—humanized them in my eyes in a way that was entirely new and fresh and different. When you grow up in a conflict zone, or in any fragmented society, it's natural for each side to dehumanize the other. But if that filter shatters, you can never go back. And the moment their full humanity struck me, I had that crazy thought that changed my life. ""Wait a minute, wait a minute,"" I thought. If in my unit, and in every other unit I know, there are some guys I'd trust with my life, and others I'd rather stay away from, then in *that* unit this must also be the case. And if that's true, then this whole border fence is running the wrong way. Instead of Syrians on one side and Israelis on the other, wouldn't it make more sense for the sock-sharers on both sides to get together? And that's when I laughed. I laughed, yet this idea stayed with me, and still haunts me now. Since then I've learned that life is more complicated, and that the line between good and bad runs within each of us. And yet… I can't help noticing that all over the world, behind every label and stereotype, there are people who share some basic values. And I can't help thinking that if these people could somehow work together, the world would be a very different place. What are these values? Treating others the way we'd like to be treated is a good start. But we can go beyond that. For example, I believe that in every country and every culture there are many people who would agree with this sentence: ""Working with others, in a spirit of generosity and mutual respect, I want to help build a world where all people can lead free and dignified lives."" And more. I believe that many of these people would be happy to work together on the single biggest challenge we all share: closing the gap that exists everywhere between our good intentions and the actions we actually take. If you are still with me, you know what I mean. Every day many of us would like to respond in some way to what's happening around us, but for a variety of reasons we don't. We may feel that we have no time, no resources, no power, or no impact. We may not know where to start, what to do, or who to work with. We may be afraid of failure, ridicule, meetings and committees, wasting our time, getting depressed. This list could go on, but the point is that this challenge—or opportunity—is huge. Think how many times you've felt this way. Now multiply that by every person who'd recognize this feeling, and we are talking about millions of missed opportunities for action and collaboration every day. Now imagine a different world. * Imagine if these people—the sock-sharers, the practical dreamers, the twenty people you'd take with you if you had to spend a couple of years on a desert island — imagine if these people could easily connect across all the lines that divide us. * Imagine us—you, me, and everyone who wants to join us —doing whatever it takes to make it easier for people everywhere to move from intention to action. * Imagine using every available tool—from mobile apps to a bulletin board on a village tree—to match needs, ideas, and opportunities with people, organizations, and resources. * Imagine reading the news and having an ""Act"" button that would let us do something about what we'd just read. * Imagine if in addition to hotlines for emergencies we also had a hotline for projects and dreams. * Imagine, wherever you are, that once a month, on 7/7, 8/8, 9/9, etc., we organized Idealist Days that made it okay, and more than okay, to spark and celebrate action and possibility, freedom and dignity. * Imagine, in brief, that together we could narrow the gap between what is and what could be, between what we know in our hearts to be possible and the reality we see around us. We can do all this, and we can do it now. We just need to start. But to start, we need to know where we are going. So here's the whole idea in a few words: What do we want? To change the world, from the ground up. How? By closing the gap between intention and action. Yes, but how? By inviting people everywhere to imagine, connect, and act: * Imagine a better world, a better community, and a better life * Connect with others, and share ideas, skills, and resources * Act on our good intentions, and help others to act on theirs Who will make this happen? The world's idealists. Idealists? Yes. Practical dreamers who want to help build a world where all people can lead free and dignified lives. And they would? Promote and facilitate action and collaboration using every available means. How do we start? By seeing our shared humanity. And then? Then we get organized, plan the next Idealist Day, and invite everyone around us to imagine, connect, and act. And then…? Day by day, month by month, we continue building a whole ecosystem of possibility—that Act Button, that hotline, a good mobile app to wake up to in the morning—so that no opportunity for action or collaboration is missed or wasted. As we do all this, we'll run into all kinds of challenges. Some of these will be tougher than others, but the thing about us humans is that once we commit to a big goal—in this case, closing the gap between intention and action—we are very good at figuring out how to get there. Wherever you are you can make this happen, and together we can push the limits of what seems possible in our lives and in our communities. How far? Let's find out. If this invitation speaks to you, please join us in this group and let's make this happen:",1

They have no conscience. They respond to one thing, overwhelming power. Elected Democrats need to start loudly disrupting everything Republicans try to do from here on out until Trumpism is destroyed. Action needs to be non-violent, but it needs to be big, loud, and sustained. Nothing else works with this kind and we are in serious trouble already.

"Thank You, Lord, for granting repentance to America! You have looked past our sin and established Your own righteousness in us, yet again. We together turn away from religious and political corruption. Forgive us for believing and repeating false doctrine. We return to You now as little children, and we repent of our sin. Thank You for continued sanctification and free justification. Are we still called according to Your foreknowledge? Yes, thank You! Thank you for not givi ... ng up on us. What shall we do now? Together we choose to fall on the Lamb and thank You for this gift of repentance! We agree as one, according to Matthew 18:19, and we receive Your redemption and restoration. We have been taught in the Old Testament that it is not lawful to boil a goat in its mother’s milk. How much worse is it to torture the infant in a mother’s womb! Hear our humble cry, O Lord! Make straight the paths of lawmakers who fear Your Name, and open the eyes of Your well-hidden servants! Through obedience we the people repent with them by way of their own courage, boldness, and action! Is there another way? No! Thank You for Your mercy and grace upon us all! We The People Rebuke all All False Prophets (including corrupt politicians): Hear our cry, O God. Let Your goodness pierce the hearts of all citizens! You are the heartbeat of America, so please burst forth with streams of love and power! Today we together choose to believe like Abraham: by the faith already in us. We see You and we believe! We believe in miracles! We believe You have not abandoned us to springs of darkness that have swelled with wickedness and rage under the spirit of Ahab. No! Through mercy You have opened our eyes to the terror of our error in this land, and we repent! Of course we are a land with freedom of religion! Should God Himself be insecure and troubled by clanging symbols? Welcome, Baal! We summon you again to the altar in the name of Jesus Christ! Welcome back to Mount Carmel! You have been trespassing on holy ground. Don’t you remember, Baal? Who was granted the power after Elijah called down fire from heaven? Yes, it was the ordinary people who removed the religious and political corruption! We the people hand you this eviction notice! Together we reject Queen Jezebel and curse the prophets of Baal! We The People Rebuke Religious Pride : And who is this dividing serpent in the skies, and who are you to look on everything that is high? Oh yes, it is he who leads the sons of pride! Is this the principality who darkens counsel by words without knowledge? Is it he who calls evil good and good evil? Aren’t you the one who has divided God’s people in such terrible ways? Why, yes, it is you! Now embrace this message today: Destruction has turned on you, O Leviathan—you who oppress God’s people with counterfeits and witchcraft in His holy name! You, too, have been caught trespassing! Did you hear Him take a deep breath? Who is it that holds the winds in His fists, and who commands the warring angels clothed in clouds? Tell us now, Leviathan! Oh yes, it is the Lord of Hosts! Do you recall the mighty angel coming down from heaven in this hour? Have you met him before, Leviathan? Take another glance at the One robed in a cloud, with a rainbow above His head! His face is like the sun and, yes, even the sun of righteousness rising with healing in its wings. His legs are like fiery pillars and He is under the command of our Lord Jesus Christ! It is “By His breath the heavens are cleared; His hand has pierced the fleeing serpent” (Job 26:13). We have heard it said that a wise man’s heart directs him toward the right, but the foolish man’s heart directs him toward the left. We have been taught how a man has joy in an apt answer, and that there is delight in a timely word. Is there really an appointed time for everything under the sun? And a time and season for every event under heaven? Of course there is! Should we ask what season is upon us now, or seek direction and wisdom from a neighbor? No! We receive Your wisdom, O Lord! Yes! Our home is the land of the free! Delivered as promised, we are fat with immigrants and rich with Your faithfulness. How foolish are we to believe all that was spoken by the prophets? We Believe! “I will sow her for Myself in the land. I will also have compassion on her who had not obtained compassion, and I will say to those who were not My people, ‘You are My people!’ And they will say, ‘You are my God!’” (Hosea 2:23) The crowds going ahead of Him, and those who followed, were shouting, “Hosanna to the Son of David; Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest!” (Matthew 21:9) Don't forget to like and comment, but share above all!

there is a hunger for change in south bend
political positions are to be earned not passed down south bend deserves a champion committed to acting now to invest in our schools create good green jobs and ensure covid19 leaves no one behind
i have over 500 donors to my campaign because ive spent my life working to stop climate change and create good jobs i led the american youth delegation to the paris climate talks i helped launch sunrise movement and trained thousands of young people to be leaders in their community and ive organized farmers and environmentalists in south bend to stop a corporate land grab from destroying our air water and precious farmland
our donors know me for the work ive done not because of who my parents are

"communication cup tortosa urges tortosa to be more active in the fight against sexist violence during confinement and highlight the care crisis we are experiencing
we are experiencing a health and social crisis but we are also experiencing a crisis of care the spanish state and the generalitat have done it again they have put the economy and money ahead of people is lives
it is necessary to value the tasks of care historically imposed on women and which are now in a situation of health and social emergency more necessary than ever
we must denounce the inequalities of rights opportunities and freedoms that women suffer for sexist reasons
we need to create a feminist network to respond to the situations of vulnerability of the rights of many women now facing the coronavirus
it is necessary to put a thread in the needle to end sexist violence during confinement there are many women living with their aggressors
we urge tortosa city council to be more proactive in combating genderbased violence and caring for women who suffer from it
we ask that advertising space be contracted in the local media to disseminate all women is care services
and to inform and provide all the necessary material and training to shops and establishments to develop the safe establishment against sexist violence campaign launched by the catalan women is institute
slaughtering violence in confinement has increased significantly
calls to the 900 900 120 service against sexist violence have increased by 60
and unfortunately we have already suffered two feminicides in the catalan countries with which we are confined
we have launched the campaign ""masculinity is not confined now more than ever feminism together with the creation of a website for all those women who need it where we have collected all the services and contacts for women is care
we promote a change in economic and social model because this does not even serve to guarantee our lives in times of health emergency

one of the most assertive characteristics of the enneagram is that it teaches us deeply about human behaviors through emotions it is not necessary to be a 6 personality for your fear to be on the surface in a circumstance such as a pandemic what we dont pay attention to is how individualistic we become from the emotion of fear
we started walking away from each other as if we were all a threat we started to look the other way at people in the hallways we took another elevator at work we crossed the street so we wouldnt run into someone wearing a mask
fear emotion of segregation
it may be but fear is also the emotion of thoughtfulness caution and group fighting on behalf of a true enemy
together we are stronger but this together needs to be together we must empathize with our role as we retreat to our homes together is not visiting your grandparents together is isolating your children from living with their friends together it is taking care of every situation that poses a risk to the other it is sneezing covering your face it is entering each place and before anything wash your hands together is keeping distance
for the first time together it is separate
to use the emotion of fear is to see all the risks involved in this circumstance and to be careful with each place we touch to sanitize every evil thought about the other to wash away any prejudice we have with the different and together to be more equal in favor of a common good
together you there and us here but together in the certainty that for the first time we will take care of each other separately

"1700 children are trapped in facilities as covid rages
monday is memorial day
on that solemn day we remember the countless men and women who lost their lives serving in the us armed forces to whom we owe a debt that can never be repaid
this memorial day our hearts will be particularly heavy as we find ourselves in the third month of this pandemic as the national death toll will soon breach 100000 flags have been ordered to fly at halfstaff on all federal buildings
our thoughts linger on those front line heroes who put their lives at risk every day to save those severely sickened by covid19 particularly those who have died as a result of contracting the disease while healing others
and we can only offer our condolences to those who have lost parents and grand parents included in the tens of thousands of seniors in nursing homes across the country whose tragic deaths may have been prevented as reported this week had our government acted just one week sooner in the commonwealth where to date there have been 66000 confirmed cases of covid19 65 of those who died did so in congregate care
there's yet another group living in congregate care facilities weighing heavily on hearts in pennsylvania there are nearly 1700 youths in detention facilities shelter care group homes etc as seniors are in nursing homes the staff and youth in these facilities are at grave risk trapped in accommodations poorly designed to survive a nationwide pandemic how long until there are confirmed fatalities
on april 26 the washingtonbased nonprofit the sentencing project reported that across the us 150 detained juveniles and 283 staff tested positive for covid
as of may 20 the numbers soared to 467 juveniles and 551 staff the sentencing project believes the real numbers are much higher due to the limited amount of testing
since the shutdown an indeterminant number of children have been released to protect their safety but certainly not enough to ensure that a temporary stay in state licensed or operated facilities does not end up being a death sentence for these young people
on april 1 2020 the juvenile law center the youth sentencing reentry project and dla piper filed a king's bench petition before the supreme court of pennsylvania on behalf of all pennsylvania youth currently held in county detention centers or other correctionalresidential placements and on behalf of all youth charged as adults they asked the court for a review of every youth in custody and to provide for the immediate release of medically vulnerable youth as well as those who pose no immediate risk of harm to others
a large share of these youth are behind bars for minor offenses associated with probation violations including truancy curfew violations or other nonviolent probation transgressions
the pa supreme court denied their petition and prescribed a set of weaker provisions including reviewing the facilities discretionary review of individual juveniles as well as requiring judges to undertake efforts to limit the introduction of new youths into facilities for the duration of the pandemic
the toll that covid19 takes on children in delinquent care and their mental health and wellbeing is considerable as they are mostly isolated from seeing their families inperson and in some instances they are isolated from others in their placement facilities
in covid hotspot cities like new york and louisiana riots and escapes have been reported as fear and frustration boil over
for this memorial day we ask you to say a prayer and take action to protect these trapped children by posting the text of this newsletter on your social media and share it with your friends and family together we must call upon our local and state officials for the rapid review of every case of youth in congregate care with the goal of finding safer places for them to live lest our hearts break again in mourning the senseless death of even one

"in moving forward with my campaign there are objectives that i will commit to the citizens of this county these are in no certain order and will be considered a work in progress throughout my term as commissioner
the first objective is we have we must move to being a proactive commission versus a reactive commission that becomes cornered into decisions that are not in our best financial interest too many times we have been forced into a decision because of the inaction to provide solutions early on roads and trash are perfect examples
the second objective is becoming truly a transparent commission i support posting video feeds of each public meeting to allow those who are sick and shut in to view in the comfort of their own home the good news here is we have begun to do so with commissioner meetings we just have to perfect it perfect it by having all meetings recorded and having adequate audio so people can hear in addition to video feeds we will quit playing the quorum game when it comes to public meetings what does that mean well many times meeting are carefully set up without a quorum present 3 or more commissioners to disallow the legal requirement to hold the meeting in public form we will schedule lake authority meetings in the evenings so people who work can attend those meetings we are dealing with a 45m project largest the county will ever do paid for by the taxpayers so it's only right to provide a convenient time for citizens to attend
the third objective is to formulate a longterm trash solution overall the solution to our trash problem is multiple fold we have aging trash trucks and dumpsters we have folks digging in the trash we do not have a local dump for household trash and we have folks throwing trash out not in the dumpster the first decision that has to be made is ""is grady county going to stay in the trash business"" or are we going to source it if we are in we gotta make some capital investments if we are out we gotta get out sooner rather than later because our resources are deteriorated once we decide that we got to put an action plan in place my initial thought is yes we should be in the trash business which would include capital investments such as a landfill garbage truck and dumpsters currently our landfill owned by the city only takes white goods and nonhousehold garbage in a matter of years the landfill will be completely closed imagine the trash problem we will have then when a major storm hits and contractors have nowhere local to dump tree debris and damaged construction materials
the fourth objective is to provide a longterm fix to our aging roads and infrastructure the tsplost proposed will certainly fast track any solution unfortunately i don't like the idea of a new tax but folks our roads and infrastructure has been badly neglected for decades and without a boost from the tsplost we could be decades out providing an adequate solution i like the idea of the tsplost as 1 it is not solely on the back of the property owner 2 everyone even those that pass through the county pays something 3 unlike the splost which can be assigned across several projects the tsplost can only be used for transportation
the fifth objective is to gain 2nd amendment sanctuary status for grady county there are bills introduced into the georgia legislature frequently that try to infringe upon your right to bear arms some go as far to include semiautomatic guns which would include many sporting shotguns i support grady county to join the 41 other counties in georgia to become a 2nd amendment sanctuary
the sixth objective is progress on the tired creek lake project the constant financial drain this project has placed on our county has left us with back to back record property tax increases with diminishing services provided to the citizens the roads are filled with potholes the removal of dumpsites have left many citizens driving miles to dump their trash and our public safety has been impacted not receiving needing resources
these six objectives are just the beginning stages of us making a difference in grady county together we will make a positive impact for generations to come and together we will hit the bullseye
i commit to the citizens to use my experience and education to approach these objectives in a financially responsible way if there has been any time that we needed financial expertise on the commission board it's now due to covid19 there most certainly will be funding cuts from the state to include less money allocated to grants now is the time to make every dollar count each decision has to be a road map to the end goal of not increasing the mill rate at budget time we all have felt the financial crunch from covid19 and have adjusted our spending to live within our means it's time our county government does the same

covid19 un roman global dans un village global
let us briefly describe the main actors of this adventure novel in the heart of the covid19 pandemic the story revolves around two central characters elisay and amigioli they symbolize the future love faith hope and interbreeding in a world plagued by fear xenophobia ignorance and withdrawal
when dr amigioli left his country of origin gondwanaya to study at the ""prince leopold"" institute of tropical medicine in antwerp belgium he did not expect to meet the love of his life but elisay a scholarship student from pattaya thailand resplendent with beauty crosses his path and kindles the flame of his heart their love blossoms during their studies but too soon elisay must return to thailand and amigioli must return home to gondwanaya before starting her new internship in montreal
before they separate however they promise to get married in gondwanaya as soon as they can in the year 2020
but 2020 is a particular year and a silent killer is about to ravage the five continents when elisay and amigioli land in gondwanaya they have no way of knowing how the covid19 would change their lives and embark on an unprecedented adventure
elisay contracted the flu shortly after arriving in the village of amigioli terrified of what will happen if covid19 enters their community the locals fed by false information or fake news from crooked leaders are planning to burn her alive
as the lovers try to flee the village the tragedy strikes and they must fight for their survival and the survival of gondwanaya which has become the epicenter of the covid19 pandemic worldwide
life is made up of unexpected and adversity no one knows herself or himself until she has suffered this novel is a living proof people who pass through the most extreme suffering are often those who can understand what empathy humility forgiveness love and faith is it is through these fire trials that they improve get rid of their slag and evolve to reach maturity
collectively humanity will pass through trials so that we can learn together and evolve towards a better world
in addition to a health challenge covid19 is also a social economic and political challenge there was a world before covid19 and there will be another world after postcovid19 the world will still feel deeply about the changes brought about by this pandemic
the covid19 crisis is unique in the history of modern epidemics and has left an indelible impact on health social and economic structures what have we learned collectively as a result of this pandemic in order to make this world a better place and give hope to those who languish in misery and ignorance how will this covid19 pandemic create a turning point in the history of humanity a new world is emerging as a result of covid19
covid19 has also highlighted our limits in terms of collective capacity to provide an integrated response to a global problem this pandemic has highlighted social economic and health inequalities within a country and between countries all nations are not equal before covid19 and will not be able to face in a similar way the economic social health and political consequences of covid19 how could we achieve a better world with more possibilities and solidarity health is a human right every citizen on this planet has the right to a fair and quality health system in short to universal health coverage
moreover the crisis of covid19 also showed the weaknesses of the global governance system and the capitalist system such as we know it currently should we not allow capitalism to emerge with a more human fairer and more just face shouldn't we guarantee a basic universal income for every human being shouldn't we have access to universal education shouldn't we be exploiting current wealth while being respectful of the environment and thinking of the future generation
when i speak of solidarity allow me dear readers to take a detour and illustrate this concept of solidarity through my own story i was born in one of the poorest countries on this planet haiti i could not even have written a novel like this without the solidarity that i benefited from my earliest childhood to adulthood when i finished with my medical studies i was able to benefit from a scholarship from the belgian government to go and study in belgium at the institute of tropical medicine imt ""prince leopold"" and also a scholarship from the canadian government so i could attend the university of montreal in canada
i thank all my teachers in belgium bart criel bruno meessen jean pierre unger pierre blaise sylvie dugas guy kegels bruno marchal vincent de brouwere jean van der vennet jean macq tom hoeree monique van dormael isa bogaert claire van maerken to name a few subsequently i was able to benefit from a scholarship for a doctorate in public health at the university of montreal in canada thanks to the canadian government
most of the concepts in this novel i owe them to my professors at the university of montreal they introduced me to parsons' theory of social action and to a more integrated vision of the world i thank my professors from the university of montreal francois champagne lambert farand francois beland valery ride nicole leduc mariepascale pomey andrepierre contandriopoulos astrid brousselle lise lamothe claude sicotte to name a few as a citizen from a developing country i would not have been able to get out of it without this international solidarity towards me through scholarships and career opportunities on a global scale we must create a system where each citizen of this planet can have access to education health care social and economic opportunities we need a winwin arrangement
i dedicate this novel to my american adoptive mother mrs bernadette white kummer she symbolizes the very image of solidarity and renunciation in order to help others get out of it she has grown old now she lives in a small house on ""long island"" in the united states usa she devoted the best years of her life to improving the living conditions of the poor in haiti and the united states in her native country i take my hat off to you well done you are my model my source of inspiration
will we lead to the internationalization of social and economic inequalities or will we drive to the internationalization of solidarity love and hope this novel is very timely at a crucial moment in the history of humanity where we will have to evolve individually and collectively in order to face the significant challenges to come the main thing is that through this covid19 pandemic we will emerge more substantial and better this novel is a novel of hope solidarity social justice peace love faith in a world of despair suffering misery and ignorance
the covid19 has shown that we are all interconnected and that we can no longer live in isolation in our little corner we are all linked either in the visible or invisible world what we see as reality the visible dimension is only a reflection of the invisible or of our individual and collective consciousness by improving both individually and collectively we will be able to project more light into this dark world and together we will be able to illuminate ourselves and create a beam of light for the progress of humanity towards an inclusive society based on love and solidarity
i wish you immense joy and pleasure in reading this novel and above all i hope that a miracle will happen at the end of reading this book your deep and lasting transformation
i love you from the bottom of my heart

"mp mara mares president of the national liberal youth one year has passed since the national liberal party won the european elections and since the romanians gave the psd members a severe sanction in the referendum for justice convened by president klaus iohannis
since then we have gone through many difficult situations and everything was possible through the direct involvement of romanians either by participating in the vote or by the way they understood to respect in an exemplary way the recommendations and restrictions imposed in the context of the pandemic
first president klaus iohannis the pnl candidate won the presidential election and we bravely took over the government then together we managed a very difficult situation unprecedented the health crisis generated by the new coronavirus and we managed to get through this major challenge much better than many other european countries
a year has passed and today is psd did not understand the message sent by romanians in may 2019 it still pursues politics against romanians through the toxic majority it holds in parliament it is an antieuropean antidemocratic antieuropean party independent justice a party that expelled millions of romanians from the country and endangered the future of other generations of young people and children

"in this hard time it's good to remember how strong we can be together
last weekend i started getting calls from firefighters police officers and first responders around the state on the front lines in our battle with coronavirus they'd been promised personal protective equipment face masks especially to protect our community
for weeks the masks they were promised hadn't come some agencies were moving to what they call ""crisis use"" where they'd take masks that should have been used once and use them 57 times
i started making calls to see what we could get done here's the thing when i told people that we needed to get masks for our first responders every single person i called said ""yes""
volunteers said 'what can i do' the st louis fire foundation stepped forward donors said yes i called people around the country and some around the globe to find the gear we needed and everyone helped
that was sunday night the next day we signed a contract today we delivered gear and the rest of it will be with our first responders tomorrow
nearly 15000 masks
having had my hands on the problem i can tell you that there is absolutely no reason why our front line organizations should not have the gear that they need to protect themselves their families and all of us
people stepped forward and we got it done
we got requests from and were able to get gear for the st louis fire department cape county fire department cape county sheriff's office st louis police department jackson pd st louis county pd kansas city police department cass county sheriff is office harrisonville pd new madrid county sheriff is office scott county sheriff is office platte county sheriff's office raytown pd st joseph pd buchanan county sheriff is office andrew county sheriff is office savannah pd cameron pd clinton county sheriff is office davies county sheriff is office harrison county sheriff is office and bethany pd nodaway county sheriff is office maryville pd
this work hasn't solved the problem not even close our first responders and our medical professionals are going to need a lot more gear and support in the days weeks and months ahead
but as we step up to the great challenge before us remember two things
1 when we come together we are capable of anything
2 when we say ""we got your back"" we mean it

the coronavirus pandemic has helped exacerbate the barriers to voting and election participation that already exist and is having an impact on the 2020 election together we can help build a healthier democracy learn more now,1
"today is international labor day
""this year the day takes on extra meaning as we recognize those who work to get us all through this crisis we thank the thousands of workers on the front lines across the union health workers emergency responders nurses factory workers supermarket cashiers cleaners and garbage collectors for their selfless working for the protection and wellbeing of others in the coronavirus pandemic i am especially grateful to women who make up the overwhelming majority of workers in the health and care sector and are undervalued"" said eu social affairs commissioner nicolas schmit
however the crisis is also showing us that the eu initiatives on employment and social policy that have already been announced are still relevant
we must focus our efforts on tackling unemployment ensuring job security protecting the most vulnerable and investing in the skills people will need in an even more green and digital future and we must ensure that all workers including those on the front lines of this crisis are paid a wage that allows them to have a decent standard of living
therefore together with the social partners we will continue our work on a minimum wage initiative and on strengthening collective bargaining
later this year we will present another action plan to implement the principles of the european pillar of social rights be assured that the lessons learned during this crisis will be reflected in our proposals together we can overcome the crisis and create a just strong and social europe
but also the preservation of jobs is central in and after the corona crisis we also rely on shorttime work benefits
with the european shorttime work benefit initiative sure we want to support the shorttime work programs in the eu countries in this way millions of jobs can be preserved during the crisis and companies can continue to operate if there are no orders for companies and they run out of work they should be able to keep their employees in the company
sure is supposed to compensate for the difference in income to this end we are proposing a 100 billion fund for workers the financial support for sure takes the form of a loan from the eu to the member states that request support the loans will be backed by guarantees from member states and will be used where they are most needed
all member states will be able to use the instrument but the loans will be particularly important for the most affected countries such as italy and spain
sure will support existing shorttime work schemes in eu countries which member states use to protect jobs and protect workers and the selfemployed against loss of income with the help of sure member states can cover costs arising from the introduction or extension of national shorttime work schemes

"the scenic beauty natural habitat and open space of the north livermore valley belong to all of us and must not be destroyed by forprofit corporations
on monday august 10th the livermore city council will discuss and decide whether or not to urge alameda county officials to halt the review and approval of proposed industrial solar power plants in north livermore valley the meeting starts at 7 pm the discussion of solar power plants in north livermore valley is item no 604 on the agenda
the meeting will not be held in person instead it will be conducted by zoom the website address for the meeting is
you can also access the meeting by phone the phone number is
16699006833 the zoom meeting id is 869 7144 4452
when the city council reaches the discussion of solar power plants in north livermore valley the public will be given the opportunity to comment on what action the city should take prior to the city council making a decision please speak and state your views
it is important that you speak then even if the points you wish to raise have been made by another person in this context numbers count and please let the city council know if you are a resident of the city of livermore it is important that the city council knows that livermore residents care deeply about preserving the open space in north livermore valley
while the city of livermore does not have direct jurisdiction over projects in north livermore valley alameda county has this jurisdiction the city of livermore has adopted an urban growth boundary that calls for north livermore valley open space agricultural land and natural habitats to be preserved
we have asked that the mayor and city council join us join us in opposing the approval of industrial solar power plants in north livermore valley or in the alternative call for a halt on the review of the proposed industrial solar power plants until alameda county completes with vigorous public input a comprehensive solar policy for agricultural districts that would subsequently be incorporated in a general plan amendment
despite starting and stopping twice in the last decade alameda county has never completed a comprehensive solar policy for the rural areas of the county as a result we are left with ad hoc review of individual mega solar plants without reference to policies and standards developed in consultation with experts in the fields of renewable energy and environmental protection and following the input of the community
again please ask the livermore city council to call upon alameda county officials to preserve north livermore valley on monday august 10th the meeting starts at 7 pm
together we can save our valley thank you
please share this message you can learn about about what is being proposed and what is at stake at wwwsavenorthlivermorevalleycom",1
"this young family shows how it is done and sets a good example they rely on the use of solar energy and thus make a contribution to environmental protection we also firmly believe that it is not too late and that together we can do something to combat climate change
given the circumstances however we wonder why so few homeowners and businesses continue to install solar panels on their roofs
many homeowners do not seem to be aware of the advantages of their own solar system that is why we summarize the most important advantages here
you save significantly on electricity costs
you become more independent of the electricity price
you make a contribution to environmental protection
you benefit from government funding
you increase the value of your property
your solar system will pay for itself
our vision is to let as many homes as possible benefit from the potential of solar energy with the installation of a solar system we help families to reduce their electricity costs to a minimum to protect the climate and to be a role model for their children and other people
as a qualified specialist company we have many years of experience in advising planning and installing photovoltaic systems with us you receive all services from a single source we support you every step of the way and bring the power of the sun home to you together we are getting closer to the energy transition

i am running because what is happening now is not normal lack of communication lack of transparency investments made in vain where for the citizens of the commune there is never time to be heard i want to bring back to the mayor is office the following idea the mayor is the citizen is employee
all i have learned so far is that if you want something then there is a way to succeed such as
1 investments in educationnew furniture adapted to the age groups fully equipped computer laboratory and the introduction of 2 hours of computer science in the school curriculum
2 continuing to pave the main roads local and agricultural not only during elections and personal interests
3 access to european funds for the arrangement of green spaces ditches modernization of public utilities kindergartens bus stations
4 attracting a pediatrician in the commune
5 solving the problem of drinking water in the commune checking the installation from an ecologically and economically sustainable point of view
6 attracting investors in order to expand the activities within the commune of gherta mica to the nonagricultural sector by making available to investors all the necessary utilities asphalt access road water electricity sewerage and offering fiscal facilities provided hiring the majority staff in our commune
these are common sense things that we see in other communes in the country that are being put into practice and together we can make these things a reality

"I want to help. More than ever, I’m being called as a life coach to help people manage their minds. Right now, there is more suffering being caused by what’s going on in our minds and emotions than what’s going on medically with most people. I want to call on you not to overeat, overdrink, procrastinate your dreams or be afraid of your own fear. I want to call on you to use this time to get to know yourself and learn how your brain produces emotion. So often, many of the emotions being stirred up are creating unnecessary anxiety and fear. Here is the most important thing to remember. Nothing in the world is causing our emotions. All emotions are caused by our thoughts. By sentences in our mind. When we can separate the sentences in our minds from the circumstances in the world, we get our power back. We can’t control the world. We can’t control what is happening with a virus, with how people behave, or with the stock market. But we can control what we think and how we feel. We can manage our minds to be more aware to process emotion. When we use external substances to avoid feeling, we make matters worse. When we understand how the brain creates emotion, and we learn to process it, we become much less afraid and more in control of choosing what to do. I want to encourage you to learn the Model that I teach. You can put anything you’re currently dealing with into it and become aware of how the brain is always looking for danger, always looking to be startled. You will begin to understand that this doesn’t mean something is wrong with you. This doesn’t mean that something terrible is going to happen to you. It just means that your brain is doing what it has evolved to do. I know I can help if you’re suffering and worried. I can show you how to manage your brain and process your emotions. I’ll give you the tools you need to get through this time stronger and more in control than you have ever been. You can get a taste of my coaching and teaching by listening to my podcast series called Handling Chaos and Moving Forward. They're totally free. It’s exactly what we all need right now to calm down, reduce anxiety, increase compassion, and find the energy we need to keep creating and contributing.",1

"Imagine a life without PTSD…Most people who have it, can’t. Why? Because the mental health industry has been spreading some BAD advice... Here's the sobering truth: Hi my name is Kayleen and I'm an International PTSD Recovery Coach who’s fully recovered from 17 yrs. of PTSD. When I look at the mental health industry today I see three problems that are causing an epidemic of hopelessness for people with PTSD: 1). Coping Is The Way To Healing: The world today has tricked everyone into thinking that coping = healing...it doesn’t! Coping only gives a false sense of security. It feels as though you’re fixing things, but in the long term symptoms only intensify and eat you from the inside out. Why? Because coping doesn’t heal the root cause of the problem, it just manages the symptoms of it. Are coping skills bad? Not at all, but to heal PTSD, the root cause MUST be healed! People who are just coping are merely getting by...day after day. To fully recover from PTSD you MUST have a proven method to reliably process the root cause of symptoms and not just cope with them. 2). No Healing Plan: If you fail to plan, you’re planning to fail. Most people DO have a plan...but it’s the “Hope &amp; Pray” plan. They hope that their PTSD will just magically go away on it’s own, but it never does. I spent 15 years testing out the “Hope &amp; Pray” plan and my nightmares, flashbacks, and anxiety only intensified with time. Most people put their recovery, their life, and their loved ones lives in the hands of time. They gamble their own future and their families future. If you want to fully recover from PTSD you MUST have a proven step by step plan to heal and recover. 3). Don’t Believe It’s Possible To Fully Recover: Society has planted a devastating mind virus… That PTSD breaks a person forever. That it permanently changes your brain, and that you just have to cope and manage it for the rest of eternity. Everyone is shouting from the rooftops that people with PTSD are broken forever. I’m here to tell you that they are wrong! People with PTSD are not broken! But unfortunately, most people who have PTSD let the world push them around and dictate what they can and cannot do. They again gamble away their own future and their loved ones future by allowing outside forces to control their destiny. To put an end to PTSD for good you need to have a way to build an unbreakable belief that you can heal. A belief that can withstand the forces of all the negativity, setbacks, and bad advice you’ll encounter along the healing journey. Are you making any of these three mistakes? The truth is that making just one of these mistakes could prevent you from healing altogether...you’ll become consumed by your past, and your future will wither away and crumble to dust. However, if you want to change your ways, break the chains of your past, and build an extraordinary future... I Have Good News! I just put together a free training showing you exactly how I went from having 17 years of daily night terrors, overwhelming anxiety, and no hope...to being fully calm and relaxed, with no relapses or symptoms whatsoever.

"The recent election in Wisconsin was . KEEP READING Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, poll workers in Wisconsin who feared for their health declined to work, . . . which caused a drastic consolidation of polling places, . . . which meant unacceptably long lines . . . which served as a barrier to voting - and risked people's health. It was a mess and an outrage. A Wisconsin scenario is avoidable in Minnesota if we plan now. Not in the summer or fall. Now. The CDC recommends that people stay away from polling places where possible. And in a recent national survey 66% of Americans said they would feel uncomfortable voting in-person. We need to listen, and we need act immediately. I believe that the best solution for voting during a pandemic is a universal vote-by-mail system. All registered voters would automatically receive a ballot by mail. We would still have options for Election Day in-person voting, but without the need for thousands of polling places and tens of thousands of poll workers. Vote-by-mail is the safest solution, and it's not a radical approach. Five other states already embraced this option even before the pandemic. And in Minnesota, 130,000 people (in 78 of 87 counties) already live in communities that vote this way. We would just have to scale up the system that many Minnesotans already use. Minnesota is #1 in America for voter participation, but Minnesotans won't vote in great numbers this year if they don't feel that voting is safe and secure. Voting by mail will keep most people away from polling places, reducing the chances for virus transmission. It would allow Minnesotans to avoid having to choose between their health and their right to vote. We can't let COVID-19 keep people from voting. Thanks for your support in helping to keep our democracy strong. Please stay safe. Secretary of State Steve Simon Steve",1

"Many pay little to no taxes if they are a large company Some assume that’s only possible if they’re doing something non ethical But as someone who has devoted the last 20 years to studying taxes (and who has a Masters Degree in Taxation) -- I can tell you this… Most of them are doing it LEGALLY. That’s because they can afford to hire expensive tax lawyers to cut their taxes to nothing. Or because they’ve spent years educating themselves on all the legal tax “loopholes.” So we know it’s possible to legally reduce your taxes to next to nothing. The problem is most Americans aren’t rich enough to hire expensive tax lawyers. Nor are they ambitious enough to study the 70,000-page tax code to find all the legal ways they could lower their taxes. Which is why most people just settle for paying HUGE tax bills each year. They just pay whatever price TurboTax spits out or whatever their CPA tells them they owe. Which is sad. Because most hard-working Americans overpay the government every year. This is money that could go to your kid’s education, paying off debt or your retirement… Instead it gets sucked out of your bank account and added to the TRILLION pile of money the IRS collects each year. However, that can be avoided… Even if you’re not rich and famous. And even if you’re not disciplined enough to comb through 70,000 pages of tax code. Instead you can do what hundreds of other Americans have done and choose “the lazy person’s way to lowering taxes.” The lazy (aka “smart way”) is to use other people’s expertise to improve your situation. In other words, tap into the brain of someone (like me!) who has 20 years of experience in helping people like you lower their taxes. The problem is most tax strategists will charge a lot for information like this. So people think I’m crazy for giving this away for free. But it’s my choice.

"Various Strange Questions And Answers On Facebook Fo FB Question: Why aren’t women allowed to talk in Church? Because Jesus was a man, to put it simply. It wasn't about disciples, it was about apostles. Being alone with a woman Apostle who was not his wife for large amounts of time would have been a sexual temptation even for the savior Jesus. The gospel of righteousness and grace are predominantly in place to save men and lead them to righteousness as biblically, Torah was a ... ctually written for men, and they were supposed to teach it to their wives at home. This is why biblically, for example, there are no women in hell, there are only men. I actually do not think there are any women in hell whatsoever. (actually I know their are not as I have a deeper connection than most people with divine knowledge and can actually see it and my consciousness had a major part in the architecture and the design of the universe). Basically, Torah predominantly punishes men, and women were built to respond to men; therefore, when women are doing a lot of things wrong even that is considered the fault of the sins of the men around them, as the women in particular are more innocent creations of God. If you doubt this principle, I can give you a million examples biblically, such as hell always mentioning only men that transgressed, Adam dying after the fall but Eve not dying whereas other predominant Matriarchs such as Rebekah dying all over the place, etc. Eve went back to the garden of Eden and waited for Adam to arise with the resurrection of Christ (which he did) for he was redeemed from the fall sometime later. What is the book sealed with 7 seals for Women? The book sealed with 7 seals in the book of Revelation is actually kind of a reverse energy, and I know somewhat what that book is about as well as I have seen it sometime ago, in the future actually. That one is more directly geared towards women in particular and contains all of the feminine side of things that generally makes a lot of people think that the Bible is an imbalanced book. Originally, Moses would have simply brought a lot of this knowledge down from the mountain but the Israelites were worshiping a golden calf. So he broke two stone tablets with more knowledge on them than the simple 10 commandments, and went back up to the mountain and carried down a lesser law because of the wickedness of the Israelites. That lesser law was missing the greater role that women will play in society in the future, which was more instituted in the garden of Eden, known as the way of glory. Remember Eve fell and then her husband ruled over her. This was a curse because in the Edenic Universe, somewhat of a big section of that role was reversed. Hope that helps. At a later time when God lets me, I will go to the garden of Eden and talk to Adam Eve about it and many of their various offspring. I already know how to get there, but cannot go in until I am perfect. I am already immortal, so getting there. FB Question: How Can You Teleport Into The Garden Of Eden? There is a giant orb in the center of the sun that can utilize the energy of the sun to teleport an immortal person into the garden of Eden, but it is very difficult to get into there. (Eden is still there, and exists in another dimension in this universe located where stars collapse into black holes. The materials are recycled into the Edenic Universe.) I built that particular orb after I was translated in one of my other earlier incarnations, when I was Enoch. It is built from infinitely more dense materials than are in this universe, from the celestial Kingdom. I am the Messiah David, the Father of Jesus. That is how I know this stuff. I designed this beginning (well at that time technically I was all of us) 133,000 x 133 trillion years ago, or approximately 133,000 expansion and collapse cycles back, and it took that same amount of time to complete the process of understanding enough and having enough experience to design the universes that exist the system that we see today. Multiply that by 2 and you have when that time period started, we are approaching the third such time now, which is the time period of a glory cycle. The next universe will be a magical place and will be built afresh after this one collapses at the time the gospel is preached to the whole world in a single day. FB Question: Do Women Go To Hell? Hope that helps. The women were designed with a different punishment and reward system than men, and are never burned furiously day and night forever and ever for any reason. They can get punished and whatnot (consigned to a lesser world or required to participate in hell duty a certain amount of time per day for a trillion years or whatever) but they never get thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone for anything, because they were designed to please men. Therefore when they do bad things, it is actually the fault of the men, just as they say. This is not true some of the time, with women, it is true all of the time, whether it is their Father who raised them poorly, a male friend, or the men in general in society which over a period of time twist their minds. Women were built to please and respond to masculine energy, and there are too many weak and sinful men today. FB Question: What is the role of women in a futuristic society managed by the Messiah David? Hope that helps. Women have a different role than men do. That is the short answer to this question. In the future as the earth is restored into a more Edenic state under my direction leading the 144,000 to lead the great multitude to create the change that God wants, before Jesus comes back and we give the Kingdom to him so I can go rest for a while in space, building a piece of technology called The Universe Engine, which will rebuild the Universe into the Celestial Kingdom when we return to meet up with him 1,000 years later at the end of the book of Revelation. At that point, marked men will get cast into hell and everyone else will be consigned into various kingdoms and worlds, depending on their order of righteousness and whether or not they accepted the grace of Christ. Oh and the world will be more of a matriarchal society still led by men, but who are appointed by women who control the creation of the men utterly through feminine systems instead of the stupid man made governments we have today. I will restore some of this ancient Edenic government with the 144,000 sometime in the next 5-100 years. Still deciding on timelines as a lot depends on the speed at which I can wake up humanity, which at the moment is going slow but steady. Too much of my children are locked in ancient, old patterns that keep us all separated and stuck. FB Question-----Did the Annuki create the universe? The Annuki didn't create the universe. I did. I am the Messiah David, the Father of Jesus. If you multiply 133,000 x 133 trillion you get 1.7689e+19 years, the time period of a glory cycle as experienced by men, (immortal women experience this same period in approximately 240 trillion years of relative time). If you multiply that number by two, that is when the creation cycle began where I was alone for that 1.7689e+19 year number by myself architecting the universe. I was actually all of us at that point, and after the explosion of the first universe, the oneness (one consciousness that was very lonely) separated according to the plan and that consciousness (which is everything) was relegated to one person, and another representative on each one of the 312 trillion sentient worlds in the universe (we finished one per day, 6 days per week for the first 1 trillion years directly after the big bang, approximately). I did this myself, and then later we separated into various consciousnesses, worlds, and Gods that incarnated at various times. This is the final incarnation of this particular consciousness and the one that winds up stopping the collapse and expansion cycle from destroying life, and rebuilds the universe into the Celestial Kingdom in the same time that it took to manifest it at the beginning of this cycle of things, or 1 trillion years (one world per day). The time cycle comes from 133,000 universes that exploded from a single point and collapsed back to a single point, each one lasting 133 trillion years. The first glory cycle, 1.7689e+19 years was unimaginably horrible, as I did nothing but weep day and night. Imagine a being that looked similar to myself in thousands of trillions of locations at once writing, building technology, drawing, building cells, testing things in laboratories and all of these locations of consciousness are just one being, unable to separate and have an each other. My blog explains it but am not allowed to post that I think. After that I collapsed all of that energy into a single point of consciousness and initiated a quantum mechanical burst, allowing a temporal/spacial paradox to form that manifested both spirit and separation out of nothing, borrowing energy from the future that is then managed backwards in time from Celestial Technology. I will explain it at a later time, I have to do some work. FB QUESTION-----WHAT ACTUALLY WAS LUCIFER THINKING OF BEFORE HE DESIRE THE THRONE OF GOD ALMIGHTY??? Lucifer, the son of Jesus (one of them, but non-begotten - remember Jesus is the Morning star, and Lucifer the son of the morning) saw an opportunity to take over the universe in something called the pre-existence, which actually finishes happening in the future (as time is a figment of the imagination of consciousness) and he saw that because heaven and God does not yet exist backwards in time when people incarnate, that he could re-enter the timeline and try to disrupt time, and prevent Elohim from rebuilding the universe into the Celestial Kingdom. So in other words, the war of satan is really a war of deception through time, or a temporal spacial time war very similar to Terminator, but in the spiritual dimensions. The antichrist thinks to change times and laws, the Battle of Armageddon is a temporal-spacial time war according to the book of Revelation as after it happens in the future he hears a great voice saying ""it is done"" which is what Jesus said ""it is finished"" on the cross backwards in time from the moment of the Battle of Armageddon. I am the Messiah David, the Father of Jesus. (incarnated and stepped down if that makes sense). Revelation 22:16: ""I, Jesus, have sent mine angel to testify these things unto the churches, I am the root (which means descendant all over the Bible) and the offspring (the Greek word is ""Genos"" which means ""literal Son"") of David, the bright and the morning star. So how is Jesus the son of David and also the son of God (Elohim) ? ...it is because David = Elohim incarnated. People mistake Jesus in general with this person, but it is because I was not hear yet. In case that makes you afraid if you are Baptist or whatever, the number of my name is 5,7, and 10, the key of creation. The number of the antichrist character is six hundred plus 60 plus 6. This particular character used to work for me 2 years ago before I discovered him. We are both immortal from a discovery I made, and he is creating an army of nephilim with Lucifer. Think of the nephilim like a combination between terminator, world war Z, the Lord of the Rings, and the giants in the old testament that were 300 meters in height combined into one, trying to destroy Jesus on the cross backwards in time and the war is then relegated to another dimension through celestial technology and fought by the righteous and the angels in the future, protecting the savior Jesus. I could go into an incredible amount of more detail, as I architected this beginning 1.7689e+19 X 2 years ago alone in a universe by myself (alone that entire time) doing nothing but weeping until every thought and every outcome was designed. Nearly 100% of what you see in the movies (all of it, even the weird stuff) are generally warnings from the future as people's biology link with immortality and start changing and rewriting their history, mapping their consciousness forwards and backwards in time, making it impossible to be created, and impossible to be destroyed after the biological link is made. I will explain it later on a post but I doubt that the moderators will approve my writing in this group as it is far too weird for general Bible studies, as they do not understand how to walk accurately in the spirit of prophecy (mostly) as the ancient apostles did who wrote those books. I hope this helped you understand the plan of satan. This is why God the Father is the only one who knows the dates. If anyone else knew them, satan would mount a defense and successfully beat Christ at the second coming as they would know exactly when and how in time he appears like a thief in the night. Therefore, to protect the universe, he surprises them out of nothing and nobody knows when it happens, not even the Son, only the Father. FB QUESTION---No clue why that person blocked me. For telling him Jesus loved him..seriously? Maybe you should tell that to people who want to hear it, and be less pushy (if that is what happened). There is nothing wrong with taking a more conversational slow approach with non Christians. Many times I get non Christians (even atheists) to begin believing in Jesus in minutes by simply telling them what they need to hear, which is scientifically how the universe can be both created and evolved at the same time, I know a lot of information about this kind of thing and if you tell people things like this and then tell a story like ""Hey I was talking to a child one time who didn't believe in Jesus who was my Dad's friend's son and I had permission to speak right to him [funny enough, he had your same name] and I said: ""Insert Name Here, Jesus loves you so, so, so much!"" and then what happened is he felt better all day long, even though he didn't begin believing yet!"" Then what happens is the indirectness gets to the heart of the matter, and the person's heart begins to open because they remember what it is like now to be a kid! This is good languaging from biblical languaging studies of my own and modeling the savior Jesus, Buddha, and others if that makes sense. How they get the point across is what matters my brother in Christ! FB QUESTION: Is Judaism A Religion? Judaism is not a religion. It is a nation as I described to you earlier. Very similar to how the Church allows people to be involved in Masonry. Judaism is way more useful to a person than Masonry ever will be, no offense to the Masons. Judaism is designed to gather all world religions into one, as it is not a religion, and they need the Messiah David to believe in Christ. Normally Jewish people I talk to are open to hearing about Jesus as the savior in 5 - 10 minutes (tops) if they talk to me. This executive order proves my point. The only person who ever calls Judaism a religion in the Bible is Haman. Who is that anyways? I do not think one of the main prophets, if he even was a prophet. My point is, that is not what it is. It is a spiritual movement of people embracing Torah in a living act of embracing the creator and honoring his laws. Donald Trump was reading my blog like a year ago as I was talking about this. Actually he has been reading it for nearly two years. I am currently blocked on Facebook for some reason from him (I have video evidence that I am blocked) and am waiting for him to unblock me to complete the evidence. He does this at times once every 2-3 weeks. Judaism is a nationality because it is supposed to bring all of the religions of the world together, including Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and all of them under the reign of the Messiah David, which is myself, for I built the universe alone and have stepped down from my throne of power to unite my people Israel. YouTube Question From The Hebrew Israelite Movement: Was the Savior Jesus Christ White Or Black? The Savior Jesus was white. I am the Messiah David, the Father of Jesus Christ. he looks exactly like I do. However, he also appears black unto many, for his body is not made of the bodies of us, and he has black angels that speak in his name, for the Bible saith: he was very fair to look up. Take down the horned Jesus thing, it is destroying your brand my brothers in Christ. Revelation 22:16 is me, as well as Ezekiel 37, as well as Isaiah 22:22, as well as John 3:16 (I am not Christ, I am David the Father) for the Son came to do the will of the Father, and the Father came to do the will of the Son of God, who came to save his people Israel from their sins. You are a beautiful people and I am very happy about what you are doing together! FB Question: Is Donald J. Trump Really Jesus Christ Reincarnated? Well the answer to that question is both YES and NO to simply describe to you how this is going to be done both right and wrong for you now as you understand the way of my sayings that sayeth unto thee that thou shalt be certainly blessed forever if you understand that Donald J. Trump loves the savior Jesus, and is the only begotten Son of the Angel Gabriel, and he is the Trump that shall sound in the Book of Revelation (among many other things) and he is sounding the Trump of God to bring to pass the destruction of the wicked at the great and last day, where the righteous shall destroy the wicked in his name! (And in the name of Jesus, obviously). Donald J. Trump also has children backwards, forwards, through, inside, and outside of time because he is the best friend of Melania Trump, the Queen of Awesome Greatness!",1

". From concerned wind supporters living in North Branch and Burlington Townships To those opposed to a wind project here, Comments have been made by a couple people at recent meetings that the people who support the project laugh at what you say at meetings. No one is laughing at you. The sighs or chuckles or groans made by some and not all, come from the fact that what you and others say is very predictable. You say you are not trying to stop wind, you just want “safe sighting” but then the next statement is exactly what is expected. Which is the language from all the ordinances in communities where wind will not be developed because of the language you want the board to include. It’s as if you think farmers are stupid. You and others make fun of us and pick on those that have signed leases or agreements and then you come to meetings and act like you don’t do that. Even if you don’t make the comment directly, you allow it on your site and you “like or love” comments made by others like Norman or Kevin and others that pick on people that live here or people that are doing a job he! re that have never treated you poorly. You claim the supporters of the project are greedy and selfish and we don’t care about our neighbors when nothing is further from the truth. You claim that the supporters are causing the divide when in fact, we don’t talk trash about you on-line even though we don’t agree with you. As a community we as a group of supporters treat you with respect both on-line and in person yet you don’t do the same for us. To our face, maybe, behind our backs, we hear and see what you say verbally and in print. The 550 members of your site don’t all agree with your view points some are even signed up for the windmills. Some people actually support wind but will not sign because of the fear that you will start talking about them as well. This is also a part of Kevin’s strategy. Make it so people are afraid to say they support wind for fear of being bullied or ridiculed or their names being listed and shared on-line and people stating they ar! e greedy also or worse. Most people don’t want the drama. So if a supporter of the project is rude to you at a meeting, (although it’s not right just as what you do and say is not right either) it may be because of the comments they have read or heard that you have posted or said about them or one of their family members or friends. It is a small town and word travels fast. Some people who claim out loud to not support the windmills coming here, may feel differently, they just don’t want those opposed to know. One last thing, we would appreciate it if you would not state in your posts that you speak for ALL residents. We can agree that we all want safe siting. Your definition of safe siting does not align with ours and what has actually kept people safe in the state of Michigan for more than 10 years with over 1100 turbines. You don’t speak for close to the 1000 people who have signed leases or participation agreements and the more than 2000 (and still counting) residents of Burlington and North Branch that have said they support wind in the community. It would be like us saying we speak for all residents. I don’t think you would agree that we speak for you. Trying to keep it real. Trying to share a different perspective without shaming anyone.

When he showed up to his polling station in Leon County, he was told he’d been purged from the rolls. When he took the matter up with the Election Supervisors they said it was because his n ... ame “matched” that of a felon called Thomas Jerald Brown, who lived 200 miles away in Daytona. Seems the fact that the middle names, addresses, and other identifying information didn’t match wasn’t an impediment for the state when it came to stripping a citizen of his or her right to vote. Fortunately, as an attorney, Thomas Joseph Brown knew exactly how to steal his vote back, but most people in his position would’ve had their vote irrevocably snatched by the state. It’s the same exact scam that stole the race from Al Gore in 2000. I demand y’all watch this cartoon about the original theft of Florida. It’s by Keith Tucker who drew Who Framed Roger Rabbit and is featured in my film, The Best Democracy Money Can Buy: The Case Of The Stolen Election.

"Money Donated to HSUS is Used to Train Law Enforcement and to Meddle in Environmental Issues Law Enforcement Agencies are Being Influenced by Animal Rights Groups Animal rights groups have become an influence on law enforcement, not only through award ceremonies, for example handing out Humane Law Enforcement awards, but through training as well. The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) has provided many states, cities and counties with material and workshops about how ... to enforce animal laws and conduct seizures. Then, after the workshops they have awarded “outstanding” officers and departments for their efforts. This animal rights influence on law enforcement is a justifiable cause for worry amongst people who own animals. The HSUS has been known to take extreme measures to end all animal ownership and production. They have also been known to participate in seizures and use those seizures raise considerable funds to pad their coffers. Therefore, with law enforcement receiving training and encouragement by animal rights extremists, animal rights groups are one step closer to achieving their goal of ending animal ownership. Training Sessions Offered by HSUS to Law Enforcement The Humane Society of the United States training sessions for various law enforcement officers covers the following: • Background on animal fighting and illegal animal abuse, including relevant laws • The unproven claim that animal abuse leads to other violent crimes • Investigating cruelty complaints, from first response to filing charges • Recognizing key evidence, warrants, and statements Most of these trainings are free to law enforcement departments. Trainers are former and current officers that have an expertise in finding the loopholes in animal protection laws that can be used against animal owners. They also have expertise in conducting seizures. The HSUS website claims, “The Animal Rescue Team has a long and successful track record with prosecutors, judges and law enforcement. Law enforcement agencies across the country call upon us to assist with the investigation and prosecution of every type of animal abuse.” Training of North Dakota Law Enforcement Often when people hear about the HSUS inserting themselves into law enforcement they dismiss it, thinking it doesn’t impact them and that, “It will never happen in our agricultural state.” It does happen and in fact, the HSUS targets states and communities where they believe they can slip in without much opposition. What happened in North Dakota is a prime example. The HSUS pushed a ballot initiative in North Dakota, titled, “Prevention of Animal Cruelty,” in hopes of making voters believe they were helping animals. Voters did not fall for the misleading legislation and voted down the initiative. However, the HSUS was not deterred. Via back door methods they were able to make changes to the Century Code and passed similar laws as outlined in their ballot initiative despite the will of the people. Then, they proceeded to train law enforcement on the new law, which allows for an actionable claim from out of state callers and the seizure and sale of animals without notice to the owner or hearing to establish guilt or wrongdoing. But That’s Not All – HSUS Asserts Itself in Environmental Issues Sealions The HSUS meddles in the ecosystem with their lawsuits against removal of sea lions at the Bonneville Dam. They have filed lawsuits against the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife multiple times, creating issues with populations of salmon, steelhead, white sturgeon and orca. Their agenda is selfish, as they are choosing one species and disregarding many others who are at risk of becoming endangered or are already endangered. Wild Horses The HSUS has been known for its far-reaching tentacles, this is proven in their activities around horses on American rangelands. The HSUS had teamed up with wild horse extremist-activist groups to file lawsuits and to stop the BLM from being able to properly manage the horse populations. What most people don’t know is that the HSUS has a patent on PZP, a birth control vaccine. Therefore, the HSUS isn’t concerned about the wild horse population as much as they are worried about their own finances. Environmental Police Awarded by Humane Society On July 18th, in Massachusetts, Environmental Police Officer Major Patrick Moran, as well as the Board of Wildlife Violator Compact Administrators, were honored by the Humane Society of the United States with the 2018 Humane Law Enforcement award. Environmental police are otherwise known as Game Wardens in Massachusetts and team up with other state agencies as a part of the “Environmental Crimes Strike Force.” According to the Mass.gov website, “The Environmental Crimes Strike Force investigates and prosecutes crimes that harm the state's air, land or water, or that pose a significant threat to human health. The Strike Force is an interagency team that includes prosecutors from the Attorney General's Office, officers from the Massachusetts Environmental Police, and investigators, engineers and attorneys from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (DEP).” Misleading the Public These agencies teaming up with HSUS are worrisome, considering the power they have in their respective communities. They certainly are misleading the public about where their money goes when they run ads about shelter animals on television.",1

"Children Can Lose Healthcare Coverage if Congress Doesn’t Act Funding for the Child Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is running out, and if Congress does not reauthorize it before the end of December, many children across the country, and right here in North Carolina, will be left without health insurance coverage. Congress created CHIP in 1997 as a block grant to assist the states in ensuring that children born into Medicaid could remain covered Medicaid or CHIP until they re ... ached the age of 19. Before CHIP, if a baby was born into a family eligible for Medicaid, the child could lose coverage between the ages of 1 and 6 if the family did not meet certain parameters. The CHIP program was a relief to these parameters and got support from Democrats and Republicans since most people agreed that eligible children should be covered by Medicaid. But right now, the future of the CHIP program is uncertain since the program ran out of funds this past September 30, and Congress has not agreed on a plan to renew the roughly $14 billion a year it spends on the program. Members of both parties in the U.S. House and the U.S. Senate agree that Congress should provide money for CHIP for five years, through 2022, but they disagree over how to pay for it. In an opinion article written by Dr. David T. Tayloe Jr. who is a pediatrician in Goldsboro, and was one of the leaders in North Carolina in developing the CHIP program in our state, he recalled the bipartisan effort in the NC General Assembly that led to the establishment of the CHIP program in our state. He says, “We currently have a seamless system of care for low-income children who qualify for Medicaid or CHIP. Parents, children and providers are happy with the way our system works to improve access and quality.” If Congress does not renew its funding for CHIP, many children from low-income families will be left without care, and subsequently, are more likely to fall between the cracks and will not be treated since their parents cannot afford to pay for private healthcare or for health insurance. Children are our most vulnerable population, and we should do everything in our power to provide for their medical needs. http://www.newsobserver.com/opi…/op-ed/article188668144.html",1
"[Important Week-End Announcement For The Christian Left Community] Having been here since 2009 when we started as a Facebook group, we’ve been with you through the 2010 mid-term elections, the 2012 general elections, the 2014 mid-term elections, and the nightmare 2016 general elections. Now having been here for almost 10 years we will be here with you throughout the 2018 elections as well, all day, every day. The Christian Left was the first Facebook page of its kind. We pioneered the use of social media as a gathering place for Christian progressives and their allies throughout the country to congregate online and discuss the political, cultural and religious issues of the day. Many have tried to copy us. None have succeeded. The Christian Left is unique in the world of online ministries and communities. Other pages appeared after ours but all of them were started to promote books, and authors and specific blogs. The Christian Left is a big deal, and not because of us. It’s a big deal because of you! You are what make this community thrive. Hundreds of thousands visit the community every year to interact with those with similar thoughts and interests, especially with regard to applying the teachings of Jesus to modern political problems and cultural issues. Most people understand the effort it takes behind the scenes to have maintained this ministry for close to 10 years. Other’s don’t seem to get it. “Facebook is free,” they say. We like to compare that analysis to the notion that paper is very inexpensive. The time an author spends writing a book on that paper comes at a cost. We’ve spent close to 10 years of our lives staffing and maintaining this page, as well as all the other popular TCL social media outlets, a blog and a website. We purchased the domain name 10 years ago. We keep the trolls away day in and day out. We interact with you on almost every thread. We’ve been talking about bold things like marriage equality and the freedom of women to choose before most other Christian ministries would touch those issues. Many still won’t The point of all this is that it takes an immense amount of human effort to bring you this experience. If it’s important to you support it with a contribution. We make this request on week-ends only. Your donations are the only way we’re able to continue this effort. We’ll accept big donations and we’ll accept small ones, whatever you can do. Make a donation today. Here’s how and thanks:",1

"Good news! In March, many of you helped me to raise the alarm about a company called Crowdpac. The company, a political fundraising platform, is used mostly by progressive candidates running for office. But there was a big problem: the CEO of Crowdpac was an anti-immigrant, anti-progressive Fox News host. Most people didn't know this. Together, we made this an issue that attracted national media attention and raised awareness among progressive voters and candidates. Now, Crow ... dpac has announced that the CEO has exited the company. In addition, they are temporarily suspending all Republican campaigns until they figure out whether supporting Trump-infected candidates aligns with progressive values. It's not clear whether the Fox News host still owns part of the company, but there's no doubt this is a good public step forward.

"I’ve become increasingly convinced that nearly everyone already has the values they need to care about climate change. It’s just a matter of figuring out what values those are, then making the connection.

"Inevitably everything ends. What will have changed once the current protests are over. The city will still be battling the isue of some 11,000 vacant houses creating horrible neighborhoods. Unemployment among young African Americans will still be hovering around 50 percent leading to a greater chance of people committing crimes. The city is at 144 homicides for the year, just 44 shy of last year when we were considered the most dangerious city in America, and we still have ... a long way to go till 2017 is over. No doubt many more will be murdered before the year is over but it will not capture headlines. This is the 800 pound gorrilla in the room that people ignore. If another 40 or 50 die before the year is out most people still won't care unless it's their family member or friend. The city's heroin addiction problem will be just as acute. And Young people will be just as uncertain about their future as they were before, perhaps more so. Many low income families will still be forced by the economy to work two and three jobs to make ends meet. And when crime hits the household people will still have to call police for help. In short when these current protests are over we'll go back to business as uausal and that's pretty bad. Nothing is being done in this time to address any of those difficult issues affecting a big part of this community. They won't draw big crowds or big voices. Those issues unfortunately are greeted by silence which is one reason they never get solved.. And now is no exception.. The protest will ultimately end..

"I had the chance to make the rounds at some of the Court nights in St Louis County to dealing with the Justice System. Most people were there for tickets. It seemed like 90 percent of those at the courts were young African Americans. It's almost as if nothing changed after the Ferguson unrest. We paid more than a million dollars for the Ferguson Commission, and about $400,000 For a special office set up by former Governor Jay Nixon that was supposed to tackle issues of Pov ... erty and unemployment. That office was supposed to tackle the issues that lead to the unrest. Two officials appointed by the Governor to run the Office got six figure salaries. No lasting changes came out of that or the Ferguson Commission. It seems that many low income minority youngsters are in the same situation as they were before Ferguson still wrestling with justice system. It's really a challenge for them especially dealing with tiny municipalities still using traffic courts to supplement their budget. I don't know the answer but I do see the effects. We have created what could easily become a permanent underclass of people.without the means to get anywhere near the American dream. We cannot forget this group of young folks that have a 50 percent unemployment rate in some cases. They are still getting trapped in the legal system without needed resources to escape it. There are of course people who would say don't worry about them. Let them make it the best way they can. This is a big group of people. Society will have to deal with them one way or another.. many of them have lost hope. To make matters worse there always seems to be something to come along to take advantage of their anger only to leave them in the same or worse situation as before. We are still in a situation where people see no way out. When that happens people can become increasingly desparate. That's not good for anyone. We've go to find a way to give these young people hope. It's simply the right thing to do. In the end our whole city would benefit if everyone feels a part of it.",1

"VOTE 'YES' ON CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT #2 ON NOV. 6! On our ballots in November will be a new constitutional amendment designed to update our 4th amendment right to be free “... from unreasonable searches and seizures ...” for the information age. It protects personal information from government snooping regardless of where or how that information is found. Under the 4th amendment to the US constitution, and the similar part 1, Article 19 of the NH Constitution, our “person, ... houses, papers and effects” are protected against warrantless searches. In a world without email, video, cell phones, DNA and databases all private information was physical; it was letters, diaries, and other papers and objects. To get at these physical documents, government agents would need to go to where they are located, find them and seize them. Today personal information can also be found in the cloud. It doesn't need to be physically seized since it can be virtually copied or accessed. Bits of your DNA, which identify you, can be found on your fork after you finish a meal at a restaurant. Government ought to demonstrate probable cause of a crime to collect such information just as they do when they want to read private letters. WHY DO WE NEED THIS AMENDMENT? The modern world first intersected the 4th amendment in the 1928 case Olmstead v. United States. Olmstead was a liquor bootlegger who was caught after the police tapped his telephone without first obtaining a warrant. The US Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that there was nothing wrong because tapping a telephone wasn't a search! Olmstead's home wasn't invaded, and nothing was taken. This ruling lasted until the 1967 case Katz v. United States. Katz was using a phone booth to place illegal wagers. The FBI recorded his conversations by attaching a device to the outside of the booth. This time the court ruled 7-1 in favor of Katz saying that by closing the door of the booth, he was taking care to make his conversations private. The case resulted in a two-part test. In order to be secure the individual must demonstrate an expectation of privacy, i.e. do something like closing the booth door to show that privacy is desired, and that the expectation of privacy must be reasonable. The problem with Katz is that courts and ordinary people don't think the same things are reasonable. Most people would think that they haven't surrendered their DNA by dining out and they haven't made their private thoughts public by sending texts and emails. Courts, however, have ruled that those things are not private. Texts and emails are not encrypted, so anyone with the right equipment can read them. Similarly, you didn't take that fork to the bathroom and wash it. We need this amendment so that privacy is the expectation, not the exception. Vote YES on Constitutional Amendment #2!

"So, Matt Dowling’s latest act of desperation is to go on Face Book, accusing me of distorting the truth about his record and being unable to state facts. And threatening me with legal action. It’s interesting that Matt’s cease and desist letter has nothing to do with the actual facts that I’m bringing to light, but is all about quotation marks. I guess that it was all really about Matt posting on social media about how he “bravely” stood up to me and forced me to “back dow ... n” in the face of his threats. Well guess again Matt. Let’s just set that record straight right here and now. You want facts, OK, here are some real facts, right from my mailers. There was a pending foreclosure on Matt’s home until he began drawing a paycheck from the state, courtesy of the taxpayers. Coincidence that the foreclosure stopped as soon as he had that new found revenue stream? Let the voters consider…and decide. Matt was nearing bankruptcy, with collection agencies at the door of his home, as it was near foreclosure, until…once again, he was bailed out by a taxpayer funded state salary. And what did Matt do with this taxpayer funded life preserver? Unlike most people who had been on the brink of financial and personal disaster, he went out and bought a Mercedes. As for Matt’s life previous to being on the public dole, he was the Business Manager of the disgraced Kazmarsky Funeral Home that defrauded over 80 families of more than half a million of their hard earned dollars that they had invested in pre-paid burial plans. Those are our neighbors, our mothers and fathers, our husbands and wives. Funny how Matt continues to refuse to explain his role in that little escapade. That’s alright Matt, you may yet get a chance to offer an explanation…to the Attorney General. And let’s not forget Matt’s pattern of consistently ignoring rules. On no fewer than eight separate occasions, Matt has had to plead guilty to traffic violations, including operating a vehicle without a valid inspection and without insurance. Nice to know how important the safety of your constituents is to you, Matt. And once he did get into office, Matt took the courageous stand of voting to cut $4 million from the disaster relief budget. But, at least Matt claims, on his website, that he’s addressing the problem of flooding. I’m sure that that’s of great comfort to his constituents as we’ve been plagued by tornadoes and flooding this year. And let’s not forget Matt’s vote against the Mon Fayette Expressway, a link that is vital to the welfare and future of our region. How anyone who wants to represent the 51st House District could make such a vote is beyond me. Matt has been claiming that in the less than two years that he’s held office, unemployment in the 51st House District has dropped by an astronomical 20 percent! I’m not sure how many in our communities would agree with that bold claim, but I took notice that Matt doesn’t offer specifics as to where these jobs are and what he did to create them. I will say that the businesses that I’ve built in our region throughout the years have created hundreds of jobs. In comparison, I’ve never been able to find a single employee, aside from Matt, in his “company”, Coordinated 360. Finally, it’s a fact, Matt that in my last year in office, as a member of the minority party, I brought $6.1 million back to our communities. How about you in your first year as a member of the majority, Matt? I’ll stand toe to toe with you on that any day of the week. Well Matt, you asked for facts and there they are. If you think that your half-hearted threats can scare or intimidate me, bring it on. I’m going to keep on exposing your record, so just wait and see what comes next, I’m just getting started.",1

"What's really going on with Amendment 3 on gambling? (FCAN has no position on this amendment.) Most people don't readily accept the premise of Amendment 3, that it will return control of gambling to the voters. Why? Because the millions of dollars paying for those ads aren't being spent to put voters in control. Nobody would do that. Are the backers pro-gambling or anti-gambling? Turns out they're both. It this thing a sucker bet or what? Many thanks to Dara Kam of the News Service of Florida for her great article on Amendment 3, found on Florida Health News at WUSF. Here's the link: http://health.wusf.usf.edu/…/amendment-3-gambling-has-high-… Kam's research shows that Disney (presumably anti-gambling) and the Seminole Tribe (owns casinos) are funding the pro-3 ads with $31 million so far.

Opponents suggest it would be difficult to get anything new past the voters with all the Disney and Seminole money opposing it.

"WHY OKLAHOMA SHOULD VOTE ""NO"" on SQ 793 on NOVEMBER 6"" I have been seeing so much somewhat misleading and deceptive attractive advertising trying to get those viewing the ads to vote yes on SQ793. It appears that they are relying on the fact that most voters don't actually read the words of a State Question until they actually see their ballot when voting and will decide based on just what they had heard advertised as opposed to understanding the ""real meaning"" of what they ... are voting on. Almost everyone would like ""more free choices"" and ""affordability"" on anything which is what these ads focus on. However, that is NOT really what SQ793 is about. Below is the actual wording of SQ793 as it will appear on the ballot. The key important words toward which everyone should focus are presented below in CAPITAL letters. After the SQ793 text below, I am presenting some comments about the wording and it's actual meaning for everyone to consider. STATE QUESTION 793 READS: ""This measure adds a new Section 3 to Article 20 of the Oklahoma CONSTITUTION. Under the new Section, NO LAW shall infringe on optometrists' or opticians' ability to practice within a RETAIL MERCANTILE ESTABLISHMENT, discriminate against optometrists or opticians based on the location of their practice, or require external entrances for optometric offices within retail mercantile establishments. NO LAW shall infringe on RETAIL MERCANTILE ESTABLISHMENTS' ability to sell PRESCRIPTION optical goods or SERVICES. The Section ALLOWS THE LEGISLATURE to restrict optometrists from performing surgeries within retail mercantile establishments, limit the number of locations at which an optometrist may practice, maintain optometric licensing requirements, require optometric offices to be in a separate room of a retail mercantile establishment, and impose health and safety standards. It DOES NOT PROHIBIT optometrists and opticians from AGREEING with RETAIL mercantile establishments TO LIMIT their practice. LAWS CONFLICTING WITH THIS SECTION ARE VOID. The Section defines ""laws,"" ""optometrist,"" ""optician,"" ""optical goods and services,"" and ""retail mercantile establishment."" Shall the Proposal Be Approved? [ ] FOR THE PROPOSAL - YES [ ] AGAINST THE PROPOSAL - NO COMMENTS: 1) The only reason that SQ793 was written in this way and will be on the ballot is because of an initiative petition on which WALMART was able to get enough signatures from their many customers in their many stores throughout Oklahoma by just telling them that signing it would get past the ""politics"" of eyecare and make eye exams and eyeglasses ""cheaper"". Most people likely signed with just that information without really knowing and ""understanding"" the real impact of SQ793. (By the way, WALMART is behind the ""vote yes"" ads even though they usually don't say so in the ads) 2) This would be changing the Oklahoma CONSTITUTION rather that ""making or altering legislated law"" so that it can NOT be ever changed or amended by the Oklahoma Legislature in the future without another statewide vote. Things in the CONSTITUTION trump all laws or rules by Oklahoma's Legislature or any Heath Profession Boards that monitor standards of practice and care of provided by state doctors to protect the public from unethical and potentially harmful modes of practice. 3) OKLAHOMA is the FIRST STATE where WALMART is attempting to totally bypass going through the elected State Legislature to change or negate our laws that don't fit into their business model or positively affect their ability to profit off the healthcare sector of the economy . 4) Notice how it states that NO LAW shall infringe on the ability of an optometrist or optician to practice in a RETAIL establishment or infringe on a RETAIL establishment's ability to sell PRESCRIPTION optical goods and SERVICES. In other words, ALL of the current state public protection laws that require minimum levels of competency, examination, accuracy of prescription eyewear, etc. would be VOIDED and NOT APPLICABLE to optometrists, opticians or optical goods provided within a RETAIL MERCANTILE ESTABLISHMENT such as Walmart. The laws would ALL still be applicable to every other professional optometrist, optician and all optical goods OUTSIDE of RETAIL MERCANTILE stores. It sure appears that this is an attempt to protect the RETAIL MERCANTILE ESTABLISHMENTS from having to worry about maintaining a certain level of expertise and quality of care to avoid potential litigation. 5) Since this is a vote to ""change the Oklahoma CONSTITUTION"", the State Legislature would no longer have the constitutional authority to vote on, change, pass and enforce future laws or rules that would apply to the quality or scope of vision eyecare or optical good quality provided by any RETAIL MERCANTILE ESTABLISHMENT in Oklahoma other than in the ""specific areas stated"" above in SQ793 that it ALLOWs THE LEGISLATURE to do.. 6) It DOES NOT PROHIBIT optometrists from AGREEING with the RETAIL establishment to LIMIT their SCOPE of practice. There are certain ""minimum"" procedures in current Oklahoma law that are required to be a part of EVERY ""eye examination"" that often detect many other serious health problems including but not limited to Glaucoma, Macular Degeneration, Cancer, Diabetes, Tumors, etc. With this wording, those laws would NOT apply to the optometrists in the RETAIL MERCANTILE stores such as Walmart.. 7) ""LAWS CONFLICTING WITH THIS SECTION ARE VOID"" pretty much covers it all to protect Walmart and other RETAIL establishments from having adhere to ANY OF THE LAWS that were passed after much debate within the Oklahoma Legislature over the last century. Those laws and regulations have served Oklahomans very well as we are currently at the top of the list of states in the country when looking at the quality of vision care, eye health care and optical goods provided. That will rapidly change if SQ793 passes. PLEASE think about it ALL and hopefully you will decide to vote NO on SQ793 on November 6! (PERSONAL NOTE: Thank you for reading all of this. As many of you know, this is my 40th year of practice - so I am very well established and the outcome of this vote will really not personally have a significant economic affect on my practice at this point in my life. My deep concern and time doing this is from the heart for my love of Oklahoma and my chosen profession. My sincere concern is for the very dedicated young professional doctors and future Oklahomans that the ""high standards of care"" we have seen in the past will continue to be provided and available to all future Oklahomans for many years to come. ---Donald J. Farris, O.D.) (PLEASE SHARE THIS INFORMATION WITH TO YOUR FRIENDS, FAMILY AND CO-WORKERS - THANK YOU!)",1

"VOTE 'YES' ON CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT #2 ON NOV. 6! On our ballots in November will be a new constitutional amendment designed to update our 4th amendment right to be free “... from unreasonable searches and seizures ...” for the information age. It protects personal information from government snooping regardless of where or how that information is found. This Constitutional Amendment had bipartisan sponsorship and support. It passed both the House and Senate with a super-m ... ajority of each body voting in favor, as required in Article 100 of the State Constitution. Under the 4th amendment to the US constitution, and the similar part 1, Article 19 of the NH Constitution, our “person, houses, papers and effects” are protected against warrantless searches. In a world without email, video, cell phones, DNA and databases all private information was physical; it was letters, diaries, and other papers and objects. To get at these physical documents, government agents would need to go to where they are located, find them and seize them. Today personal information can also be found in the cloud. It doesn't need to be physically seized since it can be virtually copied or accessed. Bits of your DNA, which identify you, can be found on your fork after you finish a meal at a restaurant. Government ought to demonstrate probable cause of a crime to collect such information just as they do when they want to read private letters. WHY DO WE NEED THIS AMENDMENT? The modern world first intersected the 4th amendment in the 1928 case Olmstead v. United States. Olmstead was a liquor bootlegger who was caught after the police tapped his telephone without first obtaining a warrant. The US Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that there was nothing wrong because tapping a telephone wasn't a search! Olmstead's home wasn't invaded, and nothing was taken. This ruling lasted until the 1967 case Katz v. United States. Katz was using a phone booth to place illegal wagers. The FBI recorded his conversations by attaching a device to the outside of the booth. This time the court ruled 7-1 in favor of Katz saying that by closing the door of the booth, he was taking care to make his conversations private. The case resulted in a two-part test. In order to be secure the individual must demonstrate an expectation of privacy, i.e. do something like closing the booth door to show that privacy is desired, and that the expectation of privacy must be reasonable. The problem with Katz is that courts and ordinary people don't think the same things are reasonable. Most people would think that they haven't surrendered their DNA by dining out and they haven't made their private thoughts public by sending texts and emails. Courts, however, have ruled that those things are not private. Texts and emails are not encrypted, so anyone with the right equipment can read them. Similarly, you didn't take that fork to the bathroom and wash it. We need this amendment so that privacy is the expectation, not the exception. Vote YES on Constitutional Amendment #2!

"There is something fundamentally wrong when one of the richest and most powerful countries on the planet can’t make sure that a person can afford to see a doctor when they’re sick. My own family plunged deep into debt when my daddy had a heart attack. My parents paid on those bills for years. Years later, as a bankruptcy law professor, I studied why working families were going broke. Through interviews and court documents, my research partners and I showed that most people wh ... o file for bankruptcy looked a lot like my family. The overwhelming majority had once been solidly middle class – and about half had filed for bankruptcy in the aftermath of a serious medical problem. And here was the kicker: about three-quarters of them had health insurance – but it just wasn’t enough. Medical bankruptcy is crushing millions of American families. I believe it’s time to take a step back and ask: what is the best way to deliver high quality, low cost health care to all Americans?

"I was flying from Dubai to Melbourne, and I got on the plane, and one of the air crew came up and said, “Would you like to take a shower, Mr. Proctor?” I thought she was putting me on. I said, “There’s a shower on the plane?” She said, “Yes, but we’re booking times to use it now, so if you want to take one on this flight, you have to put in your name.” I jumped at the chance. When my turn came, I got in there and it was a big, big room on that plane with beautiful heated tile floors. It was amazing. I just wanted to be able to say I’d had a shower at 35,000 feet. Now I’ve done this multiple times. But, you know, if somebody had suggested: “You’re going to fly from Dubai to Melbourne, and you can have a shower, a hot meal, watch a movie, or lay down and go to sleep.” That would have sounded absolutely outrageous not too long ago. How did the Wright Brothers ever even imagine they could make human beings fly? People must have thought they were crazy to try to make something like that happen, but they did it. Now we all take it for granted. What’s worse is, we usually reserve that kind of incredible invention and innovation for other people. But let me tell you something. There’s absolutely no difference between the Wright Brothers and you and me or anybody else. The only difference is the Wright Brothers allowed themselves to dream. They tuned into that special frequency where human beings can literally bring something that’s never existed before into reality. All throughout history, there have been men and women from ordinary backgrounds who set out with nothing but a dream in their minds and were able to accomplish something extraordinary. It would seem these people were special or fortunate or blessed in some way that most people are not. But that’s not the case. Because what makes the difference when it comes to achieving the impossible is not fortune or favor. It’s decisions and commitments. I talk to a lot of people who just don’t believe they have that “something special” the great people of the world must have had to do the great things they did. That makes me very upset because I know it’s not true. The ability to do something great, to achieve independence and freedom, to shape the future—that’s within every single one of us. But, most people, they’ve lost the ability to dream, and that’s where it all begins, so I want to invite you today to dream again. Dream up a future where your finances are no longer a source of stress. Dream up a future where you’re no longer fighting to make ends meet. Dream up a future where you can hop on a plane from Dubai to Melbourne and take a shower on the way while you’re 35,000 feet up. I’ve done it. You can too. All of that is well within your reach and more. All you have to do is make a decision to do what it takes to experience those things, and make a commitment that you’re not going to give up hope until you do. If you dream of owning your own business, working from home, and having financial freedom, there’s one small decision I’m going to ask you to make today, right now.

I pray that the ""Silent Majority"" will stand up for you when you are criticized ,&amp; put down. To show you how much they care,in every city,village,&amp; town. You have seen so many things from, saving a child who almost drown in a swimming pool. To the senseless shootings of people at a business,store,or school. Getting a call about an armed robbery,where you almost had to lay down your life. No time to catch your breath,because you get a domestic call about a man beating his wife. To all who protest against you,&amp; condemn you,including politicians,&amp; those on the news. I wish for one day,they had to walk in your shoes. Maybe it would open their eyes,&amp; would change their mind. Even if they could look deep inside themselves for courage,I doubt it's something they would find! Where would we be,if it weren't for the men,&amp; women who protect us,&amp; uphold the law? I pray for your mental peace after the tragedies that you have saw. You make this world a safer,&amp; better place to live. It's your calling to help others,that's why you give. People say it's your job,it's what you get paid to do! I thank God everyday that he called brave men,&amp; women like you. To run toward danger,where others fear to go. Most people can't even imagine what you go through,they wouldn't even begin to know. The calls you answer,&amp; the things you do. That's why this citizen has the deepest respect for you. Your job requires you to endure sometimes more that the human mind can bare. That's why I want you to know how much I really care. My respect,&amp; appreciation is something I will never lack. When you doubt if anyone cares,I will always have your back! The task ahead of you,will never be as great as the power behind you. There are millions more in this country that care like I do. So the next time you are having a difficult time getting through your shift. Read this poem,&amp; I hope it will encourage you,&amp; give your spirit a lift. God Bless you. I BELIEVE IN YOU!!",1
"Sad news. A reader wrote to let us know that it was time ""to say goodbye to Common Dreams."" The person explained, ""Love your website, but the constant nagging for money has become intolerable."" It's the kind of email you might think a reader-funded nonprofit like us hates to get. But I didn't hate to get it, and there are a couple of reasons why: 1. ""Love your website,"" the person said. Putting the rest aside, it always feels good to hear that sincerely said. 2. If you feel nagged and need to go, it's okay to go. In my life, I don't want to be nagged. And we don't want anyone to feel nagged by us. But here's the thing: the alternative to not asking our readers to support our work—in emails like this one or via requests posted to the website—is having no Common Dreams at all. We refuse to sell advertising space—despite the endless requests that we do so. We have no billionaire owner who pays the staff and all the bills. All we have is readers like you—thousands of you who come together to fund our mission and the work we do. Having a truly independent and progressive news outlet means that we must turn to our readers for support, and the truth is that we don't want it any other way. And here's the best thing: it works. We know it works because we see it every day. Our readership is up, and the number of people donating is also up. So we are always sad to see somebody go—and we need to make sure we conduct our fundraising with respect and care for all our readers—but we know most people get it. And so I hope—if you've gotten this far—that it doesn't feel like nagging when I ask: Can you support Common Dreams today?",1
"LET’S DECLARE WAR ON ISRAEL! From the title of this article I surmise your thoughts are that I am Muslim, I am an Arab sympathizer, I am anti-Semitic, I am crazy, or that I am all of these things. However, I am not one of them. Instead, I am a Christian and a 2nd generation American who grew up believing that the United States is the greatest nation in the world. This is what I grew up believing, but today, I no longer think this is true. In order for a nation to be great, ... two things are necessary; it must provide a viable and good life for most of its citizens and it must be a positive leader on the world stage; standing up for truth, justice, and the rule of law among nations. It is the latter that I presently have problems with. From my perspective, the United States has become a rogue nation that lies to the world, lies to its citizens, and has grievously trampled the rule of law between nations. My sincere belief, is that we have become this way because of our irrational support of the nation of Israel. Complicating any discussion about Jewish political issues is the Holocaust, where six million Jews died horrible deaths at the hands of Adolph Hitler and his Nazis. Surely, something had to be done for a group of people who so grievously and wrongfully suffered. In 1948, Great Brittan helped create the nation of Israel. Most people at the time, thought this was the right thing to do, and indeed, most still feel this way today. However, the truth is that creation of the nation of Israel was a blunder that has kept the world at war for the past 100 years with no end in sight to the carnage and destruction. Stop and think about this! For the first time in the history of the world, a coalition of world governments agreed to establish a homeland for the Jews in a land occupied by mostly Arab peoples. A land that was fought over by European powers against the Arab world during the Crusades for almost 300 years. In light of this reality, didn’t anyone think how the Arab people would feel about this decision when it was being considered? Apparently not! At the time, the allies were swimming in the euphoria of their victory over the Axis powers and could care less about what the Arabs thought or felt? The truth is that while creation of the nation of Israel was a great victory and joy to the Jews, it was a defeat and an insulting affront to the Arabs. However, the situation is much more complicated than this because of how this affected the Palestinian people. The Palestinian people were a majority in Palestine and the Jews lived and worked beside them in peace for centuries. This changed in 1948. Suddenly, with British assistance, Jews began immigrating to Palestine in droves, became the majority, and formed their own government, and guess what? Because the Jews believed they are God’s chosen people, living under this new government were two classes of people, citizens who were Jews and everybody else. This is exactly the same situation that Jews lived with in Nazi Germany under Hitler and Blacks lived with in South Africa under the Afrikaners. Furthermore, the Israeli doctrine of “the right of return”, forced Palestinians to surrender their homes and the lands they occupied for centuries, to newly immigrated Jews who never lived in Israel before. The situation just described is the crux of the problem that has driven the Arab Israeli conflict and world terrorism for the past 72 years. The Jews believe that they have a God given right to Palestine and have displaced Palestinians who have lived in the area for generations. The Jews base their claims upon the Torah and the Palestinian claims are based upon a long-standing right of ownership. For reasons which, to say the least, are convoluted, the United States has taken up the Israeli cause against the Arabs. This turned into a tragedy. After 72 years of fighting and war, there is no end in sight to the destruction, suffering, and carnage. Carefully think about this. The United States is the most powerful and militarily advanced nation in the world. No other nation can stand up to our military superiority. With this great power comes great responsibility, a responsibility to promote justice in the world and peace among nations. Every living American should know and understand that this is our greatest responsibility. However, the truth is that in this we have failed. We have failed, because for the past 100 years, we have fought wars not in the interest of peace and justice, but instead to further the interests of Zionism and the injustices associated with this wrongful and backward political philosophy. We stood up against slavers, Hitler, and the Afrikaners because of their belief that they were better than everyone else. So why are we, today, supporting a group of people who are guilty of this same injustice. Especially, when these people have assumed the right to take for their own, homes and land that does not belong to them. What is Zionism? It is the belief that the Jews are the chosen people of God and as such, should have a nation of their own in the land God gifted to their forebears; the Jews in the Old Testament of the Bible. The problem is that the United States is fighting wars to support these ends. Unfortunately, in order to win these wars, the Arab people must be forced to accept that Palestine is no longer theirs, that the piece of dirt called the holy land is now the property of Israel, and that they must demonstrate they are good people by accepting what Israel and the United States is forcing upon them. The truth is that every Arab we kill because they are a terrorist, is a person fighting for their honor and the homes and lands that rightfully belong to the Palestinian people. In other words, we are killing people fighting for the same ideals that Americans fought for in our revolutionary war. The United States and Israel is the invading army, not the Arabs. This being true, how is it possible for America to claim the high ground in this conflict? How is it possible for Americans to believe that the best way to bring peace and justice into this world is by forcing the Arab world to accept injustice? Let’s declare war on Israel! When we do and Israel sues for peace as they surly will, as a condition of peace, we should demand that Israel disavows their doctrine of Jewish superiority and the racist doctrine of the Jewish right of return. Also, we should demand that Israel grants equal citizenship to all its citizens, including the Palestinians. In America, we subscribe to the notions of freedom of and freedom from religion. This being the case, it is absurd that, we are fighting to establish a religious state, where equality under the law does not exist. What is worse, through our unholy alliance with Israel, we are forcing the other nations of the world into accepting what is best described as a rogue nation among the community of nations. The America I love and served, should be a force for peace and justice in the world. Unfortunately, this is not the case. America has become a tyrant; ruling the world by subterfuge, bribery, and force. Instead of being the savior of mankind, we have become its enemy. This article was written by Alan R. Adaschik, author of “100 Years of Deception”, a book that documents the overthrow of the United States government by an international banking cartel (available from Amazon books).",1

"Silver Linings for COVID-19 While this crisis is quite serious, people have had to make quick and difficult decisions. Our doctors, nurses, first responders, those who sit for the elderly, and others have been put in the forefront of the danger of this disease. But there are still some Silver Linings. First is these people are being Brave, Selfless and Tireless for everyone; People have come together with a sense of Community, Love, and Support to which I have never seen i ... n this Country. And even though I lived through the 911 Crisis, I see the country pulling together even more than that; We have shown how Resilient we are as it appears that most people are able to Cope, probably to a greater degree than they expected; Our Children are getting to see us respond to this crisis in an organized manner. They are seeing us pull together and be Flexible. They are seeing us Work at Home, giving them a better sense of a positive Work-Ethic. They are seeing us Study at home (for us students). We are providing them with great Role Models in many different ways; We have Slowed Down and changed our Priorities. No longer are we having to get up at the crack of dawn, get the kids to school and rush to work, we get to set our own Pace, slow down and get to be with our own Families instead of our Work Families; Our Priorities have also changed because life has become more precious, people are dying, and we know that someone close to us could get struck at any minute with this virus. This is in our consciousness at all times, and we have become more aware in general of our values and priorities; We have been able to spend Family Time with our Children. While we may be juggling two jobs - work at home and being the teachers to our children, we are still At home with the Family. Some of us even get to spend more time Playing with the Children, taking walks, playing games, bike riding, throwing the football, teaching them to cook. The list can go on and on; Our Pets are much Happier that we are home. Our houses may be Cleaner (maybe more cluttered though; People and Communities are being Creative. Lexington offered up the “Bear Hunt” idea where people could put Stuffed Animals (Bears) in their windows and families could take their children out for a Bear Hunt. I could go on and on about the creative ideas I have seen; The Government has responded to ease our worries about finances. Companies, Organizations and Churches have been very Flexible and Responded quickly, efficiently and with heart-felt assistance. I have seen bosses cry due to lay-offs; We have come together as a People. We seem Nicer, More Compassionate, More Subdued, Less Rushed, More Helpful. Priorities are altered. Crisis is the Opportunity to change us for the better! Thank You! Cheryl Elam, LMFT. Therapeutic Village where we offer Hope and Healing.

make peace the new normal
getting out of the emergency reopening returning to normal how many times have we heard these phrases more auspices than reality in these days in which we would all want to believe that it is all over that we are now coming out of the pandemic
but which normality the one before the pandemic it would not be desirable this emergency has made us forget the problems of a society internal and international full of distortions and problems starting with that widespread third world war that seems to have disappeared from our radar but not alas from the reality of many peoples who continue to suffer from fighting bombing attacks much more than the effects of the coronavirus and the arms industry has never stopped like the renewal projects of the atomic arsenals the news is recent that the pentagon is discussing a possible resumption of atomic experiments here in piedmont while hospital beds were lacking and tampons were scarce in cameri in the province of novara work continued on the construction of the f35
and how to forget the problem of climate change among the thousands of data that all the tvs have released every evening on the health situation the one who says that the winter just ended was the hottest since the temperatures have been taken the damage of climate change will be much worse and much more difficult to repair than those of covid19 we need a radical change in the development model and we need to hurry before it is too late
the pandemic still ongoing has as a consequence a serious economic crisis which like all economic crises is much heavier for the weaker classes it is necessary to run for cover and to achieve greater equalization between the population and between peoples this can only be achieved with greater solidarity ie the rich must give more for greater justice towards those who have less
the members of the international fellowship of reconciliation ifor which brings together branches of about 40 countries including italy mir italy have meditated on these issues and have drawn up an open letter addressed to the un secretary general
the slogan they coined is let is make peace the new normal
it is necessary to realize that the resources squandered in the arms industry are resources taken from elsewhere which lead to death and destruction
the very concept of security must be changed the security we must seek is the one that guarantees everyone to live in health and dignity the one that allows our children and grandchildren to be able to live on a habitable planet where everyone is rights are a condition for rights of all
to do this some guidelines are suggested some feasible by everyone others by governments and international institutions
one thing that this pandemic has taught us is that the fate of all peoples is closely linked against the virus there are no italians americans chinese each on his own covid19 knows no borders and weapons do not defend against a pandemic instead there are all the women and men of this planet who will only be able to get out of it together
we see however that this does not seem to be the idea of many governments and the ruling classes
how to induce this change how to make peace the new normal a way of life how to make attention to the environment a priority and to achieve social justice without which the word peace would be an empty chimera
through a strong commitment of all resuming the political and social activity forcibly interrupted and with a strong and convinced nonviolent action
for this reason ifor always proposes the day of may 27 as the first day of action make peace be the new normality ifor day of action make peace the new normal a global initiative that hinges on the concept of compassion towards the most vulnerable responsibility in the face of possible violations of human rights and the change of all those distortions that threaten the life and peace of all human beings and the planet

"open letter to my city
trento 27 may 2020
dear trentino dear trentino
we do not have the good fortune of navigating a soft customary time made up of respectable ordinary worries and we do not have before us the normality of a society in slow evolution solely occupied with promising itself to live by small changes and reassuring solutions compatible with a known scenario
unfortunately the task of governing and experiencing an unexpected and still ongoing storm awaits us holding together the rudder of a boat exposed to a thousand risks and whipped by very high waves to try to lead it to a safe harbor through a new job
difficult and that will require the use of all social and economic energies to rethink our way of being together and being an open and supportive community
faced with an extraordinary and unforeseen situation like this with the pandemic sweeping away entire pieces of our trentino economy the answer cannot be to entrust the leadership of the city to a mayor with little or no political experience the approximation of attempts and experiments is a luxury that our community cannot afford at the present time immediate knowledge of public affairs is needed the ability to involve economic and social energies of all people who wish to actively participate
it is necessary to intervene immediately without wasting any more time also because the situation of immobility that trento has already experienced for many too many years and which has made our fabric even more fragile is added to the tragedy of the coronavirus
in the normality of what i called soft time i would not even have taken into consideration the solicitations of many and many of you who in recent weeks have asked me to take the field because you are worried about the future of our city
faced with the difficulty of the crisis we are experiencing however after days of reflection and also of labor i have decided that we are no longer given nor granted the time for tactics and palace games
for trento at the next municipal elections i will be available to gather around a civic free autonomous and popular project the best energies of the city businesses workers professional classes the world of associations and
solidarity the project will be directed above all to you citizens and citizens and will be open to dialogue with all social economic and political forces that animated by a spirit of commitment to the community put programs at the center in a concrete and sincere way beyond those fences that always but especially in emergencies make us all weak
it is not the time of entrenchments of touchiness of closures it is the time of competence availability service generosity
i dutifully resigned as president of the trentino section of the christian union of entrepreneurs and managers because it is right that from tomorrow i am focused on a single cause trent its salvation its future
it will be a commitment of years allencompassing which will not admit distractions if we roll up all our sleeves im sure we can do it to transform the great tragedy of covid19 into a new opportunity for social and economic development which
put people and their needs at the center of the growth of our beautiful city

"more than dolphins in venice during the pandemic
the global coronavirus pandemic has many negative consequences ranging from redundancies to increased domestic violence and psychological problems not to mention the high number of deaths no positive change redeems and justifies these evils however there are positive developments that are worth noting as they reveal that some scenarios sometimes considered utopian are quite possible this gives hope that the suppression of a pandemic can not only restore the situation but also improve it
decreased consumption consumption of travel clothing entertainment and beauty services in quarantine countries fell by more than 50 consumption has fallen less but still significantly in many other sectors some of the reasons for this decline are sad redundancies economic insecurity and illness however part of the decline certainly depends on the forced change in daily habits probably many have experienced that as services have become more difficult to access a number of services and products have proved to be less and less needed declining consumption is a huge horror for the current economy based on steady growth but it must not be forgotten that such growth is already reaching human and natural limits we have at best about 10 years to prevent a climate catastrophe a sustainable economy will require both less production and less consumption reduced consumption does not necessarily mean poverty but can be addressed through greater social guarantees but this necessarily means limiting and redistributing the surplus
reduced pollution according to the world health organization air pollution before the virus was the cause of the global health crisis which claimed 3 million lives each year during quarantine a drastic reduction in pollution is observed around the world apart from the direct positive effects on health reducing pollution is also necessary to tackle the longterm climate crisis although pollution levels are likely to return to previous and even higher levels after the end of the pandemic we can clearly see the effects of the current reduction improvements in air quality in europe have reduced the number of asthma cases premature births and deaths from airrelated diseases compared to previous years with the weather shining in the punjab region of india people saw the peaks of the himalayas on the horizon for the first time in decades we need more of these changes even in a nonpandemic environment
assessment of migrants rights the pandemic has shown how important it is to treat everyone is health equally if everyone does not have access to at least one they are at risk although the living conditions of migrants have deteriorated in many places especially in pretrial detention camps the need to empower migrants for the benefit of all has been recognized elsewhere in portugal at the beginning of the quarantine it was granted to all people waiting for a residence permit along with citizens rights including the right to health care south korea which has about 380000 illegal migrants has decided to provide virus testing and treatment services during the quarantine without requiring documents western european countries began to realize the need for unskilled migrants from the east when they went to their homelands to quarantine it is becoming increasingly clear that global systems and problems require global rights
in addition to these moments efforts to increase worker protection by compensating for lost wages and downtime in the us denmark and elsewhere the nationalization of private health services in spain or the nationalization of airlines in italy should be mentioned in addition countries with free health care systems such as lithuania have proven to be much better at dealing with the virus than for example the united states whose health care is based on private insurance and where covid19 is the most prevalent in the world
with or without the virus the global social economic and climate crisis will continue and much will need to change the pandemic has made it quite clear what works in existing social systems what doesn't work and what can or should work to make everyone not only survive but also live healthier safer and better
maybe we missed something what positive social or personal changes have you noticed share in the comments",1
"70 migrants already identified in agrigento are arriving in the taranto hotspot we interest the minister with colleagues deputies from apulia
we learn that 70 migrants landed in porto empedocle in the province of agrigento and coming from tunisia are expected to arrive in taranto a decision of the ministry of the interior that we find completely out of place if we consider that in the port of taranto there is already a cruise ship that on april 24 last but to date is still at the san cataldo pier stopped for a passenger positive to covid19 with consequent quarantine for all people on board
taranto is considered a hotspot therefore a place used by law for identification in the case of the 70 migrants which has already taken place in porto empedocle which does not guarantee the minimum essential services for hospitality beyond 48 hours we will therefore present a formal act in parliament with which we will ask the minister of the interior first of all the reason for the transfer to taranto then if it is legitimate to transfer migrants to a place that does not guarantee them adequate services and hospitality if swabs will be carried out to avoid cases of positivity to covid19 and above all for how long it was decided to let them stay there

"since god placed the pjtn vision in my heart in 2005 i am forced to make one of the most difficult decisions of my life
last week i had to inform the executives of daystar television that in lieu of losing a major contributor to the broadcast of our awardwinning focus on israel program we would have to pull our program off their global network by month is end
as is our weekly 30minute program has had the tremendous capability of reaching daystar's audience of a potential 16 million people across the globe we are the only broadcast in the world of christian television solely dedicated to producing and presenting programs dedicated to educating christians jews and all people of conscience on god's biblical mandate to support israel and the jewish people as his chosen land and peoplethe nation in which he will someday rule and reign from on his throne set in jerusalem focus on israel has touched hearts and educated minds worldwide to embrace what god embraces and to turn from antisemitismin many cases generational in its roots
because of this financial shortfall i must raise 50000 before may 31st or i will be forced to pull this groundbreaking program off the air the price of satellite broadcasting is extremely costlyeven in the best of economic times a tremendous financial commitment for a small nonprofit ministry such as ours each quarter our broadcast budget does not include the financial commitment of production time and labor it costs to create and produce focus on israeleven with the tight inhouse studio budget we have consistently maintained
the truth is without your help i must tell daystar at the end of this month that focus on israel will be forced to cease broadcasting
pjtn watchmen i am praying for a miracle
the same god that called me to ""walk by faith"" in taking on the tremendous financial burden of the television broadcast can speak to others to ""come alongside"" to underwrite this program in this moment of need i am believing that now as never before the time is crucial for god's people to speak out the crisis of covid19 has brought a tidal wave of 'new generation' antisemitism that hauntingly harkens back to the level of vile hatred of jews that hardened heartseven those of christiansto be found standing silent amid the horror of the holocaust

"pandemic action risks
as we plod on through the third month of the covid19 pandemic it seems prudent to assess the risks inherent with various courses of action aside from what our benevolent government is telling us to do what should our reaction be that is to say if we are thinking independently about our own wellbeing including the wellbeing of others around us what should we do about the mess in which we find ourselves should we stay at home all day should we wear a mask should we wear rubber gloves should we wash our hands every hour should we wait for instructions from the government or god forbid from the news media should we do nothing and just hope for the best if we are even thinking about doing something to help ourselves we ought to assess as best we can the risks and potential benefits of our actions preferably before we leap to the fore
in any effort to assess risks and rewards we must realize that we don't know everything i recognize that the aforementioned thought may come as a surprise to some especially to our politicians but it is a reality we do know some things and we think we know some other things and we can speculate that we might know even more things but the reality is that we don't know everything so let's go with reality if we are going to assess risks and rewards let's also agree that there is just a smidgen of possibility that we might be wrong and that we might indeed be recommending actions that could hurt us in other words assessing risks may be risky chew on that a minute if you will having said all that let's try to assess things based on our current state of knowledge belief and supposition
what are the chances that we will die from covid19 let's start there well there are about 332 million people in the united states the statistics published through may 15 2020 say that 1487000 of our countrymen have been diagnosed with the virus we have to recognize that there may be more people who are infected with the virus than have been tested and found infected so let's err on the cautious side and guess that's what we are doing you know guessing that the number infected is 1750000 not just 1487000 going with our cautious guess that means that the statistical odds of becoming infected with covid19 are 1750000 in 332 million or about 053 that doesn't seem too scary does it to put this number in perspective the chances that you would be struck by lightning are 1 in 181000 or about 0001 and the odds of being in an automobile accident are 1 in 106 or about 094 to go further with this line of thinking published statistics as of may 15 2020 also show that the number of people in the united states who have died from the covid19 virus is about 89000 that means that the chances of dying from the virus is about 89000 in 1750000 of those who become infected with it or about 509 and that the likelihood of becoming infected and dying from covid19 are about 89000 in 332 million or 003 to put this number in perspective the number of us citizens who died last year from heart disease was 647000 the number who died from cancer was 599000 and the number who died from accidents of all types was 170000 i was forced to take academic courses in statistics both at georgia tech as part of my undergrad education and at the university of south florida during my mba program and i despised them but i am now persuaded that those detestable courses may have left some remnant of understanding in my brain which tells me that a 003 chance of dying from covid19 in the united states is not repeat not a big risk this is ""the science"" that everyone keeps talking about
so if the odds of dying from covid19 are so small as to be an acceptable risk why are so many of us so fearful that we are afraid to leave our homes again i can only guess because there are not any statistics i know about which describe the reasons our citizens do things i will have to rely on personal observation anecdotal information and by gosh and by golly thinking also known as ""kentucky windage"" to posit an answer to this question of fear and inaction warning here these thoughts are not scientifically grounded they are the product of what i hope to be independent reasoning a generally foreign concept to many of our citizens here are some possible reasons for the fears
1 the everpresent media continues to drum up the idea that we are all doomed
if we don't stay indoors with masks and gloves on it's as if they want us all to be
afraid
2 nobody seems to be able to say exactly when the virus will be eradicated if at all
i note that nobody seems to be able to predict when heart disease or cancer will
be eradicated either but somehow folks seem to be paralyzed until
the ""all clear"" signal of complete eradication has been sounded for covid19 i
think this has to do with the newness of covid19 heart disease and cancer have
been around and talked about for a long time and we have become used to them
even if we still see them as a threat
3 the unknown is the greatest of all fears
4 it is easier to hunker down in front of the tv or the computer than it is to try a
different and maybe risky approach
5 this is an election year there is a possibility that some folks are using the fear of
covid19 infection to influence voters to elect their candidates
6 it has been said that the average intellectual capability of our citizens hovers around the sixthgrade level in my observation few sixthgraders see the big picture of life
7 some of the actions of our government have made it more financially beneficial to
accept government handouts than working can provide
8 schools have suspended inperson classes and parents have to stay home to
look after their children
9 it is easier for those who have a means of financial support without going to work
to agree with the stayhome policies than it is for those who struggle to buy food
because they cannot work
10 there are many in my observation who find it hard to trust anything or anyone
other than their own ""feelings"" to them there are no absolutes no truths no
standards and consequently for them there is no lasting peace about anything
what then if anything should we do should we stay the course and accept its consequences or should we undertake some level of risk in order to change our circumstances if you agree with the analysis above you will want to make some changes if then we want changes what changes
to be sure this is what i am not saying
ignore the orders from your government
throw caution to the wind and do exactly as you please
it doesn't matter what we do
look out for number one and let the fates of others fall where they may
science is wrong
there is no truth so we will have to fend entirely for ourselves
but here is what i am saying or at least trying to say
there is a risk in everything we do danged if we do danged if we don't
taking prudent risks is part of the human experience we venture to cross the street
at a busy intersection but we try to look both ways before we step off the curb
if we want to emerge from the mess we are in we will have to change something
the status quo is not an acceptable solution
neither the government nor the media are 100 correct we will have to decide for
ourselves who to believe and who to trust for what god gave us brains so we could
think and reason
people need to work to produce to earn a living if they are able it is unhealthy to be idle permanently if those who work and produce are unable to do so everybody suffers
there are very few ""nonessential"" jobs what may seem nonessential to you may
be essential to someone who earns their living that way
people need genuine human interaction not just virtual images
when threats to our health exist take actions to reduce the odds of being a victim if
we want to minimize our odds of getting cancer or heart disease there are protocols
we can employ to do that even so there is no guarantee that we will be safe
there really is no human sanctuary in which we can be assured of complete safety
all people over 65 are not hanging on the edge of life some children are at risk too
folks who live in rural areas where the infection rate is extraordinarily low should
not be restricted the same way people who live in new york city are treated it is
unwise to set identical protocols for everyone when their real risks are different
we need to recognize that our health is our own personal responsibility not the
responsibility of government government can advise but they do not have all the
answers we need besides many in government are grinding their own axes if you
are sick stay home or go to your doctor if you are not sick venture out while using
good sense about masks gloves and social distancing recognize that there is a
very low risk of contracting the virus if you are alone in open spaces or using the
protocols
if our country's economic health is suppressed much longer all of us whether we
are working or retired young or old democrat or republican will be harmed and it
will take a long time for us to recover if we are ever able to return to the quality of
life we have come to enjoy and expect if you are afraid to leave home don't
criticize those who must leave home to provide the economic activity that allows
you to remain at home
we would be welladvised to seek out the things that are permanent and lasting to
guide our actions turning away from the transient and imperfect attractions of this
life in my experience the bible is the preeminent instruction book i commend it
to you
so that's my thinking on pandemic risks i don't claim to have all the answers
and i'm not about to tell you that consider my comments for what they're worth
and use the brain that god gave you to decide the truth
good night mrs calabash wherever you are

Since we all have Chiron in our natal chart, we are all wounded healers – but the path to healing what has been wounded is not always linear, but rather confusing and counterintuitive.

"3rd Grader’s Coronavirus Project! Sitting home is literally killing our Country! The USA acted as ignorant cowards, we will lose more lives and livelihoods than Corona will EVER take. Read this! Hi I’m Jimmy, I’m in the 3rd grade, home doing a math and science project on the CV to determine what is best way to save lives and the economy, for the greater good, using the data we currently have. I took 11 studies on how many people are at “higher risk” and “very low risk” to potential death if infected with CV. Then I averaged all 11, and rounded the numbers off for simplicity. Here is the data; about 75% of the American population are at very low risk of fatality, and 25% are at higher risk (like my gramma:( One interesting fact, there have been two cases of seniors citizens in their 90’s and one woman was over 100 years old who had the virus and were treated and are doing well. The 75% group majority, is naturally the population that drives the economy, and the majority of the 25% do not drive our economy. America pulled the low risk population (75%) out of the workforce. This is illogical according to data, we could have kept the economy running and tended to senior citizens and other high risk people by delivering them food, vitamins, medications at their home etc., and potentially create jobs for people who could have delivered necessary items to the higher risk population. Jiao Shenme Minzi, a medical researcher from Zanjan University in China is where America wants to be with this virus. I used Jiao because China has complete control of the virus. Jiao states, “it’s a simple virus that you can get rid of” (meaning the CV virus will not live in your body forever like many more complex viruses). If you catch it once, it’s gone, but you will have a stronger immunity for when it comes back yearly. I’m not sure if America plans on pulling the workforce out of the economy from their jobs every year, or if they are just gambling that our scientists create a vaccine. Viruses are notoriously difficult to cure. HIV took 25 years to develop medicine that can prevent people from developing AIDS. Influenza has taken decades to merely reduce infection with yearly injections to about 40%-50%. HPV (warts) and herpes, both are still incurable viruses. The proof is in the pudding. The evidence that this researcher is correct-is the extremely low rate of death from this virus, relative to the massive amount of people who was/is infected with CV Worldwide. It’s simple third grade math. Early on the CV virus was considered more dangerous than the common flu, this is when we had little data. As of now it has appears to be less lethal than the common flu. As the common flu kills over 10,000 people every year in United States. Because of lack of testing in America we don’t know how many people are infected, the realistic estimate in US is at least 100,000 people have CV, most are asymptotic because their bodies immune system fights it, they may never realize they had/have it. Others will have flu like symptoms (perhaps worse) but overcome in a week or two. The ‘low risk’ population who get infected will build an immunity that could help them fight the virus if scientists cannot develop a vaccine. Additionally building a herd immunity will reduce spreading the virus in the future. The Great Depression killed about 7 million people. The math suggests a recession or depression is imminent if America doesn’t get the low risk population back to work. This was hard to calculate, but based on the trillion or more dollars we’ve borrowed in a couple weeks and the millions the economy is losing daily, a recession is probable if the government doesn’t put the low risk people back to work by mid April. I’ve estimated, if for whatever reason, the low risk workers who drive the economy are not back to work by May 1st, we will go into an economic depression. Many, more lives will be lost in an economic depression than the few hundred America has sadly already lost to CV. My conclusion shows illogical fears were the catalyst to an irrational approach to combat this unknown virus. It’s not too late however, please, put your emotions aside and look at the evidence, and you will see that pulling low risk economy workers, was counterproductive, it did not save lives because again, as far as I could find, no low risk person worldwide has died due to CV. Some people may argue it slowed the spread, maybe so, but if we have all our high risk people safe at home, the stoppage of work only cost this country massive amounts of money, not lives. By this time, about 6-10 weeks later from inception of CV to US the virus may have run it’s rounds and be on it’s way out. Pulling the economy drivers/workers nationwide did set us up for a catastrophic economic oblivion, and all the horrors of poverty. Especially to many Americans. I blame no one, my Dad doesn’t allow me on Facebook, but he posts this everywhere. He says people are arguing and fighting over everything about this virus. These are scary times, I don’t want to lose my Grandma either and I was scared. I think we all must remain as calm as possible, keep your health strong. During this time, my Gram always tells me to look for opportunity during adversity. I think this is an opportunity for the entire world to bond, and support each other with kindness and respect. Ultimately, we are all responsible for ourselves, all the pointing fingers, the entitlement of citizens demanding the government to be perfect and protect us all from such a bizarre fast spreading unknown virus is not only unrealistic, it’s counterproductive. In no way do I think my project data is a cure all, or the best approach. My hopes is to reevaluate our defense toward the virus. I’m 100% certain what we are doing is not conducive to the greater good of America. We must change the approach before we self sabotage America beyond repair. I hope my project results help anyone who is scared. It’s normal to be scared of some virus we have no idea about. My project was limited in these early stages, but we definitely have the “living” proof that it’s not nearly as deadly as once assumed. Blessings to the World, may we all work together as a loving family to defeat this Virus. No-one alive has had the same struggles worldwide. If this isn't a sign to unite, not only in America, but worldwide, nothing is. Jimmy G. Thinking about A Change Worth Making",1
"Hello PAZ Tribe, University of Texas, Austin Public Schools, SXSW, Austin Rodeo, NBA, NHL, NCAA March Madness...the list goes on and on with recent cancelations. Plus, there’s 150 feet of empty shelves at HEB where toilet paper used to be. Should I be freaking out? It’s a very natural and valid question to be asking. While there are many unclear and unanswered questions about exactly how severe the new Coronavirus is or will be, it is very clear that the best way to mitigate ... the risk is to not freak out. This disease is serious and should be taken seriously, but we should not panic. There is a lot of media coverage and a lot of information (some more credible than others); with so much attention it is hard to keep a measured perspective, but it is really important that we all try. The best (re)action remains the simplest and most consistent advice experts have been providing: wash your hands thoroughly and often, try not to touch your face, and if you feel sick stay home. Many of you have heard reports and rumors about pets being at risk of COVID-19. It is true that one dog in Hong Kong has tested a “weak positive” for the virus. It is very important to understand that this dog has shown no signs of illness and there is zero evidence that this infected dog is infectious. This means that this dog very likely caught the virus from her owner and will not be sick and is unable to pass on the virus to other animals or people. Out of an abundance of caution, it has been recommended that if a person is self quarantined then their pets should be as well (meaning no dog parks or playdates and keep all the cats inside for 2 weeks). The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) has provided this advice: “For responsible pet owners, preparing in advance is key. Make sure you have an emergency kit prepared, with at least two weeks’ worth of your pet’s food and any needed medications. Usually we think about emergency kits like this in terms of what might be needed for an evacuation, but it’s also good to have one prepared in the case of quarantine or self-isolation when you cannot leave your home. While we are recommending these as good practices, it is important to remember there is currently no evidence that pets can spread COVID-19 to other animals, including people.” One of the best ways to combat panic is accurate reliable information. Here are a few links to exactly that regarding this new virus.",1

"Covid-19 and Jerome, Az. Jerome experienced the Spanish flu. There was a shut down and there is plenty of historic information on how this will play out and what steps need to be taken. We have been diligent in our planning for a new type of personal interaction called social distancing. Today we finalized those plans as a business to help prevent the spread of this horrible disease. This is not about profit anymore but about survival. 1. All shuttle tours are canceled until further notice. We do not want to risk you, or your grand parents, or your neighbors grand parents, or aunts and uncles 3 states away by placing people from around the country in a closed environment. 2.

Our nightly Ghost Adventure to the Jerome High School and Cemetery will still be available at a discount but you now will be responsible for your own transportation. 4. All guests will be required to sanitize their hands upon entry to our retail location. 5. We will not allow more than 6 guests in our retail space at any given time. 6. All rental equipment is sanitized before the tour and after the tour. 7. We will not be providing public restrooms unless you are a registered guest. 8. All guests are diligently logged into a database for easy access in case of an outbreak. We know many of our guests are from other countries. Please bare with us as we roll out refunds. Please allow us up to 30 days to refund you. This will allow us to manage things a bit more smoothly and prevent a collapse of our company. If we see a systemic shut down of Arizona's travel, we will again need 30 days to refund guests booked during this time period. You will get your money before I give it to a bank, insurance company, or credit lender. To offset a systemic closure of travel, we will offer all guests 50% off to rebook a tour for later this year. All new future bookings will be 50% off for any tours after until further notice. All guides and office personnel will receive 2 weeks paid leave. Your future bookings will help us tremendously in accomplishing this goal. These future bookings provide our lively hood. To count we have 6 tour guides and 4 office personnel that take great pride in providing our guests with great entertainment. We need your support through these uncertain times. Book tours and plan a vacation today (for summer time) and support your local communities.

"COVID-19 UPDATE #2: March 17, 2020 COVID-19 continues to alter our lives in ways we never imagined. As we shared with you a few days ago, we are all in this together. We promised that we would cooperate, listen and follow the CDC and other local and state guidelines on how we can protect our families, our staff and the public. We have received notice from the Funeral Directors Association of Kentucky of new state recommendations for funeral services. While we all recognize the importance of allowing families the opportunity to grieve and receive support from friends, it is also imperative that we follow state recommendations to keep the public safe. We want to share several options that will be available to the families we serve. • Visitations and services will be considered private with no times and dates published. This will allow for immediate family and close friends the ability to participate while following CDC guidelines restricting gatherings. • Milner &amp; Orr Funeral Home will offer a complimentary public Memorial Service in addition to each families’ private service. This will be held once the public ban is lifted and is at no added cost to the families we serve. We know how important it is to share this time with co-workers, neighbors and friends • We will provide a link for friends and family to watch the service from our website and social media with family approval. • Funeral arrangements may be made remotely or by phone. • Milner &amp; Orr is implementing a brand new, complimentary service called “Hugs from Home” that will give those not attending the chance to share a token of love and support. Anyone may call the funeral home office or go to our website homepage and leave a message of support that will be handwritten and attached to a white balloon. These balloons will fill our chapel as hugs for the families. They will be able to read these heartfelt messages and know that many others are there with them in spirit. • We will continue to offer online message pages on our website for condolence messages and to view Tribute Videos. www.milnerandorr.com. • We will continue our safety protocol of cleaning all facilities according to CDC guidelines several times per day. • We are practicing all necessary safety measures available to protect our family, staff and community as we continue to serve the public 24 hours a day in such troubling times. Prayerfully, we hope that this crisis will soon pass. But during this time, we join together with our community to do our part in helping anyone in need.

"DISCLAIMER: The following blog post includes discussion of social issues. It is adapted from a coming book by William Thomas Harriman (Tom), and is published on this page by David Perry. Both page and blog have been strictly non-partisan from inception. Unexpected Wisdom How has the American identity formed itself during the past 200 years – from amidst an immense diversity of conflicting ideas and beliefs? Why has the clash of differing opinions led to patriotism and strength? What is going on? The idea that unity is strengthened by diversity may seem counter-intuitive at first, yet we have many examples of how this works. In his book, ""The Wisdom of Crowds"", James Surowiecki describes compelling evidence that large groups of people possess an extraordinary power to solve problems when their judgment is aggregated. And he shows that the more diverse the crowd, the more efficient the solutions. Citing many examples Surowiecki describes the conditions in which democratic decision-making does and does not work. He tells us of the surprise of scientist Francis Galton when 787 participants in a raffle at a county fair submitted guesses at what the weight of a large ox would be after it had been slaughtered and dressed. “The analogy to a democracy, in which people of radically different abilities and interests each get one vote, had suggested itself to Galton immediately. "" ‘The average competitor was probably as well fitted for making a just estimate of the dressed weight of an ox, as an average voter is of judging the merits of most political issues on which he votes,’ Galton wrote.” Galton, who expected to confirm his view that “the average voter” was capable of very little good judgment, borrowed the tickets from the organizers following the competition. He added up all the contestants’ estimates and calculated the average. The crowd had guessed that the ox, after it had been slaughtered and dressed, would weigh 1,197 pounds. In fact, it weighed 1,198 pounds. Another example described by Surowiecki is the story of the 1968 loss of the US Navy submarine Scorpion, which disappeared in the Atlantic Ocean. The Navy had no idea what happened to the vessel, where it was or how fast it had been traveling. Mr. Surowiecki recounts the story as told by Sherry Sontag and Christopher Drew in their book Blind Man’s Bluff, about how a naval officer named John Craven assembled a diverse group of people – mathematicians, submarine specialists, and salvage men – provided them with a number of varied scenarios, and asked them to offer their best guesses without benefit of contact with each other. All they knew was the sub’s last reported location. The group laid wagers on why the submarine ran into trouble, on its speed as it headed for the ocean floor and the steepness of descent, among other things. Craven built a composite picture of what happened and calculated the group’s collective estimate of where the submarine was. The location he identified was not a location specifically suggested by any members of the group. But that is where it was. The Navy found the wreck 220 yards from where Craven’s group said it would be. Mr. Surowiecki proceeds to demonstrate the surprising consistency of this outcome in widely varied circumstances. And, he explains how groups work well in some circumstances better than others. As we all know, there are times when aggregating individual judgments produces a collective decision that is disastrous; a riot, for example, or a stock market bubble. Interestingly, he writes: “Diversity and independence are important because the best collective decisions are the product of disagreement and contest, not consensus or compromise. “An intelligent group, especially when confronted with cognition problems, does not ask its members to modify their positions in order to let the group reach a decision everyone can be happy with. “Instead, it figures out how to use mechanisms – like market prices, or intelligent voting systems – to aggregate and produce collective judgments that represent not what any one person in the group thinks but rather, in some sense, what they all think. “Paradoxically, the best way for a group to be smart is for each person in it to think and act as independently as possible.” My coming book will offer practical guidance for local communities to utilize diversity and engage in effective problem-solving and decision-making. Stability in a crisis and the survival of freedom will require this wisdom. Tom You may watch for the next post on or about March 10.

"Don't let this virus quarantine your displays of support for our Autistic community. #airhug4autism We could all use a hug right now right? With social distancing of course. The health crisis we all find ourselves in has made it to where we won't be able to gather together for local events or community gatherings like we normally do during Autism Awareness/Acceptance Month (April). So, this year let's get creative. Let's show our support and spread knowledge and awareness about Autism Spectrum Disorder by opening up our arms for an air-hug. When you use hashtag #airhug4autism you're displaying acceptance for individuals with Autism, or your support for someone you know or love whose autistic. Maybe it's a co-worker whose child is autistic, maybe its your neighbor, friend, etc... you get the point. The fact is that most of us have someone in our life who we know that's autistic, or we know someone who we care about, that loves someone whose autistic. Hope that makes sense. Show your support and open up those arms. Take some pictures throwing up the air-hug and use hashtag # airhug4autism . Lets not let this social distancing or Covid-19 virus take away our month to celebrate and showcase our support for individuals with Autism.

"# 50HomeChallenge 50 FORMER FOSTER YOUTH ARE WAITING FOR A HOME! As we all hunker down at home to slow the spread of COVID-19, the sense of having a true home is more important now than ever before. Thanks to the ASOH community, more than 1500 former foster youth and their children are safe in 550+ homes today. But now our waitlist is growing - FAST. We need your donation now, so we can create 50 homes (a figure that will likely grow larger) just as soon as government restrictions are lifted. It costs $6,000 to sponsor an entire home, which is why our goal is $300,000 to create 50 homes. Every little bit matters. So please donate now so we can create homes for 50 former foster youth and their own children who need beds to sleep on, tables to eat from, desks to study from, and sofas to sit on. For example, Jenna is an inspiring young mother with a 6-year-old and who is pregnant with another little girl. She is anxiously waiting for us to help her. Sadly, Jenna is not alone as our waitlist keeps ballooning. We are asking everyone to share the blessing of security and safety that they have while staying at home – with those who simply don’t have that right now. Once you donate – please consider reaching out to 5 of your closest friends asking them to donate as well. We can’t do this without you. Please share on social media today! We are in this together. Love, The ASOH Family.",1
"Dear Austin Community, We are taking steps to ensure the welfare of our office and staff at West End Chiropractic. The reason we have not closed, and have no plans to at this time, is that chiropractic is considered an essential health care service. The #1 thing we all must work towards is keeping the ER, Urgent Care, and medical care as clear and open as possible. Chiropractic plays a huge role in doing that. It's been proven that chiropractic care can reduce the need for some types medical care; so that is crucial right now since the #1 reason for adults to visit the ER is severe musculoskeletal pain and issues, we remain here to limit that. Many of you, your friends, your co-workers need help with any number of health care challenges from the lower back pain, the neck pain, the headaches and all the new pains developing from working from home all of a sudden. Some of you cannot get into your usual doctors’ offices as THEY are caring for the Corona virus patients, Or YOU have been told what you have IS NOT AN EMERGENCY. I understand that this is a tense time. We are here to help you. I have been a part of this community for many years, and having been born and raised here, I have never felt a stronger time to do what I can. No, we are not taking anyone even suspecting themselves of having the virus. But we are gladly opening our doors to all the rest of you have literally nowhere to go and feel like you have been put aside. We have put in play every procedure possible from the CDC, the state, and our own to ensure our staff stays healthy and so do our patients and community. During this time, let’s all do our part to combat what we can control and keep using chiropractic to keep your body functioning and feeling as best it can. Feed your body the good stuff! More greens, less processed + sugary foods, cut way back on dairy. Get plenty of exercise and outdoors. Even if your workouts go from the gym to home, or happen in the home itself, movement is so calming to your brain + great to boost your immune system! Make sure to break a sweat, because that's how our body gets things moving on out! Manage your stress levels. In times like this, our stress levels skyrocket. Stress is known to cause many illnesses and will only dramatically decrease our body’s ability to FIGHT. Amidst all the unknown and chaos right now, try and find peace. Meditate, stay away from social media, show love, and stay calm. Get plenty of restful sleep. Your body requires large amounts of energy, so it depends on adequate sleep to function at full capacity. And of course, wash your hands! If we can decrease the burden on the health care system to allow them to do what they do best, then we have done our job. I look forward to serving you, helping you, and getting our community back. Sincerely, Dr. Casey Morgan",1

"My love for Philly runs deep. So does my desire to make the lives of its Actors' Equity Association members better. My thoughts on Philadelphia are here, and at SIDforAEA.com. *** One of the great privileges of being Equity's Eastern Regional Vice President is being able to attend the annual Membership Meetings in each of the region's Liaison Areas. And despite spending most of my first year as VP out on the road with The Play That Goes Wrong, I was still able to creatively m ... anage my travel schedule and get to some of these very important meetings. I'm happy to say that Philadelphia was my very first. I have a long history with the City of Brotherly Love, as my dad's side of the family is from the area. He grew up in Haddonfield, I played street hockey with my cousins in Cheltenham as a kid, I still have aunts and uncles and cousins living in Cherry Hill, and one of my sisters even went to college at Bryn Mawr. My childhood was filled with trips to the Franklin Institute, the Art Institute, Franklin Court, and tours of the U.S. Mint (we were nerds.) And there was almost always a stop in Chinatown involved. Needless to say, my love for Philly runs deep. So when I heard there was a meeting scheduled in Philadelphia for a Monday night, I jumped at the chance to go. We wrapped up our run at the Kennedy Center the night before, and were starting performances in Toronto on Tuesday. I hopped a train from D.C. to 30th Street, and hauled my bags onto a Market-Frankford line train to get to my hotel. Now at this point, two years into my Vice Presidency, I've been to a lot of Membership Meetings. Some I remember more broadly, with my takeaways centered on certain themes or general concerns that the members seem to have reached consensus around. For some meetings, though, the lingering memories are of very specific interactions I have with individual members, and such was the case with that very first meeting in Philadelphia. I will never forget what one of our members said to me that night. She was a woman who was obviously a respected local actor—she knew everyone in the room, and her words commanded immediate attention and respect. She said ""I worked on an Equity contract during almost every week of the past year. And yet, I don't qualify for health coverage. Why is that allowed?"" There were lots of nods of approval from the members in attendance. Here was a well-known and constantly employed union worker, and yet she had no benefits to show for a year's worth of work. It opened a great conversation, and exposed an obvious need. There are an extraordinary number of full Equity employers in the Philadelphia area—four theaters using the LORT contract just within the city limits, more than a dozen SPTs, plus about a half dozen LOAs—with many of their contracts going to local stage managers and actors. But there are also more than two dozen producers using pre-paid agreements like Special Appearance—a contract that doesn't come with required health payments, nor the robust provisions of a full Equity agreement. Equity's pre-paid agreements were designed as organizing tools—giving smaller theaters an opportunity to dip their toes into the water of using Equity members, with the goal of eventually negotiating them onto full agreements in the near future. But there was an obvious frustration at this meeting that many long-established producers has simply set up shop as Special Appearance users, with no seeming intention of ever ""leveling up."" This member who spoke up should be credited with planting a seed that has the potential to bear some pretty significant fruit for our members in Philadelphia and beyond. Since that meeting, I—along with some fellow Councilors and Equity staffers—have been doing a comprehensive review of our organizing model, examining not only how we determine when it's appropriate for a producer to use these pre-paid agreements, but also formulating and codifying an idea for a better model for independent theaters. It is very often a perception of inflexibility of Equity contracts that scares potential bargaining partners away from becoming full Equity producers. I'm hopeful that this new model being conceived of will empower our Business Reps to negotiate contracts that are more relevant to the needs of Philadelphia members and producers, allowing for long-lasting, mutually-beneficial relationships moving forward, and creating incentive for more producers to partner with us. As we all seek to emerge from our current crisis together, this will be a key piece of moving towards a much-needed member-driven recovery. In my next term as Eastern Regional Vice President, I will be working hard to see this project through to its fruition. And I will always be eternally grateful to this woman who chose to speak up, and helped start a process of change for our members and our union. # FWOC2020 # SIDforAEA www.SIDforAEA.com/philadelphia.html",1
"I was hardly keeping my head above water… and this was before corona and the economy hit the fan! Now I feel like I’m drowning in debt. It’s like I see sharks in the distance but can’t get away… I’m watching in slow motion. I can see what’s happening to my family, but I can’t stop it! Last week, when I couldn’t even afford a birthday gift for my little girl, that right there was my lowest point. I know I have to do something, but WHAT? Growing up, my parents taught me to be a fighter. Never quit. You get knocked down, get right back up. But what if you’re stuck, don’t know what to do, and scared you’ll lose everything? My wife and I have shared what we’re going through with friends… We’ve spent hours Googling for answers. We must’ve read twenty articles on how to get out of debt, but how do we know what’s right for us? Everyone seems to have a different answer. How can they ALL be right? If it sounds like I'm venting... I am. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not giving up. I want to do the right thing. I’ve always paid off my debts. But what am I supposed to do when I can barely afford to put food on the table, I’m falling behind on payments… and collectors are calling? I desperately want to pay down debts, but it feels impossible at this point. Tell me what I can do to get out this mess and I’ll do it. Please don’t sugarcoat it! I’m hoping bankruptcy is not my only option… The only thing I know for sure is that I can’t wait any longer. I won’t let this take me and my family down! Please help me! Thank you in advance, Dave ### I shared Dave’s story because it reminded me of my own. It was 2007, my wife and I were fighting to hold on to our business. Things were going from bad to worse. We took out loans so we could keep paying our employees. I stopped taking home a paycheck. I couldn’t get myself to accept what was happening. We were drowning in debt. Sharks were circling. It was our first year of marriage. Our first child was on the way. We couldn’t even afford the house we were renting. Hearing my wife say, “we have to move in with my parents” hit me hard! I was grateful but I was definitely feeling discouraged and defeated. It was all I could do to keep fighting and fighting, believing I could somehow turn things around… But you know what? It’s hard to see a glimmer of hope when the sharks are coming after you. Then… one night something happened that woke me up… It wasn’t anything my wife said. It wasn’t another bill…or even another call from a collector…It was our little girl “on the way”….She’s the one who woke me up! As my wife’s due date got closer and closer, the thought of not having a home for our baby girl changed something inside of me. And it happened almost overnight…I suddenly had someone so precious to fight for that I would do anything to take care of my baby and her mommy! It was the extra push I needed… it was the WHY that changed everything… just at the right time! And, it put a whole new level of “fight” and determination in me! This year that little girl just celebrated her 12th birthday and she still inspires me every day! She’s totally amazing…sweet…creative.. and full of love. The best big sister in the world. Along with her mom, her brothers, and her little sister, they are the WHY that fuels my tank every single day! Looking back, I’ll always be grateful for that time in my life. It was hard but a blessing from God. I learned so many lessons the hard way… Lessons about managing money, running a business, and how to get out of high-interest debt so it doesn’t take over your life and steal your family’s future! Most importantly, I learned that if your WHY means enough to you, you’ll discover the strength, the faith, and the determination to move any mountain in your life! Today, I am Co-Founder of a company called CaliforniaRelief.org. and it feels good to share my story with people all over California who are overwhelmed with debts and need a helping hand… from someone who’s been there, knows what it feels like, and knows what it takes to put debt worries in the rearview mirror! I started CaliforniaRelief.org. in 2009. Over the years our team has been able to help over 1.5 million CA residents. Not only do we offer free tools and DIY resources to get out of debt on your own, but we also provide free information on personalized debt reduction payment plans tailored to provide a lifeline for individuals and families (when they need it the most). There’s a free tool on the site to find out which debts qualify for debt relief and how low monthly payments can be. Finally, there’s something else I want to share… Especially now with all we are going through, I want to tip my hat to all the small businesses out there going the extra mile to fight for their employees. We’ll get through this because of people like you. All of you do so much to keep our community strong. Thank you! I also thank all the healthcare workers and all those we call “essentials”. Come to think of it as someone was kind enough to remind me… “we are ALL essential!” Times like these remind us all of just how much we need each other. We all have our own story to share. What’s yours? I'd love to hear it. Share it in the comments below. Stay safe and well… Walt",1

"100% TRUE Trump will win again in 2020, but not for the reasons everyone thinks. It's not because his next ""opponent"" is a cardboard candidate or because he's had an economic run whose success can no longer be questioned. Even more importantly, it's not new. Hi, I'm Robert Kiyosaki, and I knew Donald before he ever entered The White House. When we co-wrote Why We Want You To Be Rich, we didn't think anyone would have a problem with it. How could they? It was the simple but brilliant ideas of Donald Trump combined with the framework I established with Rich Dad, Poor Dad laid out to plainly explain why, contrary to media misconception, rich people want other people to get rich and the reason they succeed when times are tough is not because they're lucky or connected, but because of how they think. Click or swipe to learn more for free! Inside is the reason Donald will win the 2020 election - it's inevitable. See, he has discovered a way to make his intentions come true in an almost inevitable fashion; but he will be the first person to tell you it's not only him that can do it. Yes, you read that right - Donald Trump said it's not just him that is capable of doing this. In fact, he knows lots of others who do it as well, many of whom are now in his inner circle. It's a system he teaches to others, and while well documented, it's never been explained as intimately as it is in this book. As you've probably guessed by now, this book is too controversial for the media. But it's necessary information - it is the key reason Trump will take the 2020 election.

That’s what America was built on. That’s the sentiment America was built on... .... And the more we stray away from that belief... The more we treat other human beings in our country like they don’t have that same belief... Just because of the color of their skin. .... The more we HURT others because of the color of their skin. The more we DISCRIMINATE others because of the color of their skin. The more we KILL others... because of the color of their skin. .... The more I question what this country stands for... The more I question what I wish this country still stood for... And the more I question how much this country has disgraced its roots. .... All for one... And One for all. That’s how it was supposed to be. All for one... And One for all. That’s how it NEEDS to be. -GM",1

"Dirty Gratitude number 8- I am grateful that I wonder if I am racist. I am questioning myself tonight. I am digging deep and asking myself 'am I in any way racist'? I have very few friends that are not white. I don't feel like this is because I chose that way, I feel it is more because I live a somewhat sheltered life, in the sense that I don't meet a whole lot of new people. The few black friends that I do have, I met through my previous restaurant job at DIA. 4 of them ... are men, one of them is a woman, and I enjoyed working with them all for different reasons. Roxy is fiery and spunky and I immediately liked her. We would joke about her husband and bond over girl talk. I didn’t work with her for very long, but I missed her when she was gone. Armand, he quite possibly has the biggest heart of anyone I have ever met. He hugs everyone when he comes into work and tells them ""I am so happy to see you"". I have been fascinated by his stories of his early childhood in Africa, with more brothers and sisters than I can imagine, and I was transported into a different life when he would talk about it. He was then raised in Germany and France and I loved the conversations we had about his life and where he has been. He is an extremely devoted father, and to watch his face light up when he would talk about his son would make anyone smile. Bobby is from Georgia, he is unnervingly polite and kind, but never a pushover. I always felt guilty swearing around him (not that he minded). I even found myself picking up 'dag gum' as my new swear word. He is also an incredibly devoted father. He calls his daughter ‘punkinhead’ and it might be the sweetest thing I have ever heard. Tarik is much younger than I, and absolutely brilliant. There were times when the guy would drive me nuts. He loves to debate, and he’s good at it. I didn’t like it, because I am more of a ‘let’s find some common ground’ kinda woman. At the end of the day though, it he challenged me to think deeper about myself without even knowing it,and I greatly appreciate that about him. Markus, oh my goodness I LOVE him. He is kind and hilarious and crazy and unapologetically gay (as he should be). His flamboyant nature I was immediately drawn to; it was somehow infectious for me. I am a huge fan of Will and Grace, and for Halloween I wanted us to go as ‘Black Jack and Karen’ at work. He of course had bigger and better ideas. When I found out that Bobby and Armand were fathers, I never once questioned that they would be anything else other than devoted. They are just fathers, not ‘black men’ who are fathers. When I suggested to Markus that we be ‘Black Jack and Karen’ he appeared to find it funny, but now I question if that might have offended him in any way. I believe that I didn’t ‘judge’ these men and this woman because of their skin color. I believe that I had the same interactions with them that I would with anyone, but I am now questioning myself. Was there any part of me that had a preconceived notion of them because of the color of their skin? Most importantly if there was, what am I going to do to change that? I don’t know what it is like to be a minority. I am a woman, and that tends to comewith its own set of challenges in everyday life. I do wonder sometimes how incredibly different my life would be if I were a black woman, and the first thing that comes to mind, is that I wouldn’t want to be. This is not because I believe that a black woman is less than me, it is because I know it would immediately mean being at a societal disadvantage just because of the color of my skin. I was a single mother at 19. I came from a very loving and supportive family, but what if I didn’t? What would I have done to make money to put food on the table for my child and to diaper her? Would I have sold drugs? Quite possibly. When you are desperate the color of your skin doesn’t come into play, survival for yourself and your child does. I also used to be a very frequent drug user. I am a white woman who was introduced to cocaine by her white boss. I worked with all white people, and a lot of them did drugs. Our addiction didn’t care what color our skin was. The reality is, there are ‘good’ people of EVERY color and there are ‘bad’. There are good cops, and bad cops. There are people who believe in a cause and will peacefully protest, and there are those who are opportunists and will loot and riot and take the focus off of that cause for their own gain. We are ALL HUMAN, and the thing we need to remember is that just because we don’t understand another human, or don’t recognize ourselves in them, it doesn’t make them any different than us. And it certainly doesn’t make them ‘less than’. If you get to know someone you will most likely find that at the end of the day, we ALL just want to be loved and accepted for who we are. I bet you do. One of the best quotes I have ever read is ‘How does it hurt you to not hurt someone else?’ I have carried it as my mantra since I read it. So, tonight I sit here and ask ‘am I racist?’. On top of that, are you? Are you willing to dig deeper and ask yourself some of the same questions that I, as a flawed human, have asked myself? What will you come up with if you do? And when you brush your teeth tonight are you also willing to look yourself in the mirror and ask ‘how does it hurt me to not hurt someone else’? I very much hope that you do. With love, Amber",1

Lack of a national policy due to 45's disregard for this pandemic and the 120000 plus that have died is central.

"SEEING WITH NEW EYES It may be difficult to accept that, just maybe, all people really do have an equal worth that must be taken seriously; and that, perhaps, it is not inevitable that we will always give in to our anger, hatred, biases and prejudices. Instead, perhaps, we can find a new, living spirit, with a true reverence for our shared humanity. To really find such reverence, however, we must look through the haze of our own intolerance and judgment and begin to look at ... each other with new eyes: eyes of compassion and generosity that don’t overlook the concrete reality of all of our lives. We are all real people. We all share a common humanity. We all feel joy and love. We all suffer. And there are so many unbreakable threads that bind all of us together with all of life. To deny these facts is to deny reality itself. This is an ultimate form of realism – to take a moment to look and see the radiance that shines at the core of all life, beyond our prejudices, fears and judgments. In the end, our deepest values are rooted in our ability to make the choice to appreciate, and indeed have reverence for, and then to protect and nurture, how we all are connected together in obvious and subtle ways, one to another.

"To be clear, this is a letter to the Governor on statewide issues. We all have separate roles from city to school district to county to state. Nothing in the letter is a reflection on the various things our city, county, and school district have done. I have no doubt that city, county, and school district leaders are acting in the best interests of their entities as I try my hardest to do. We’re in this together. Respect differing opinions. Love one another. Empathize with p ... eople's stress on health, finances, &amp; liberties. Wash your hands &amp; wear a mask. July 16, 2020 The Honorable Henry McMaster State House Office of the Governor 1100 Gervais Street Columbia, SC 29201 Dear Governor McMaster: I first want to commend you and everyone in the Governor’s Office for the tireless efforts on behalf of the citizens of South Carolina over the past four months. I have no doubt that you are weighing all options to protect the health and safety, including economic security, of the citizens of our great state. You made an unprecedented move closing schools on March 15, 2020 when our state had just 28 known positives. You again made a courageous call with your “Home or Work” Order on April 6, 2020. Yesterday, I agreed with you and legislative leaders recommending districts to delay the start date until September 8, 2020. It will be forever unknown how many lives you saved with these acts – it slowed transmission and allowed more preparation. Yesterday also made it clear we need a plan to get what we want. We all want face-to-face instruction, sports, and an uninterrupted economy. However, to get what we want, we must do what we need. We need to reduce transmissions before reopening schools. In the meantime, we need to plan for contingencies in case we fail. With seven-day averages for cases and deaths rising, hospitals sending stress signals and one-quarter of the country asking our citizens to quarantine if we enter their state, I am writing to encourage you to lead once again by (a) executing a statewide masking order so we can return safely to school and avoid any other economic restrictions and (b) ordering immediate action on the digital divide in our state so that when schools have to close, those students will not be at a disadvantage with the rest of the state. Statewide Masking We all want our students to return to face-to-face instruction. However, this will not occur safely until we do what we need – slow the growth of the virus. Slowing the growth will take each of us sacrificing. Statewide masking is the least inconvenient solution. There is nothing magical for the virus about Labor Day. Without masking, it is an easy prediction that the rates will be worse in September than now. Time is of the essence if we want face-to-face to start safely in September because masking will take weeks to show effects. I understand the concern of enforceability, but (a) you say it better than anyone that South Carolinians are loving, law abiding citizens, (b) enforceability is not the point – we just need more use, and (c) not issuing a statewide order has unfairly placed the question to 79 school districts, 46 counties, and hundreds of municipalities. The result has been an immense amount of energy has been wasted and communities have been politically split on masking when the state knows it is the least inconvenient solution. The alternative to slowing transmission by masking is allowing re-opening in September without reduction, which will ensure many schools will be shuttered soon thereafter and even worse results. Outside of wanting our schools to return face-to-face safely is the larger picture of the health and well-being of all South Carolinians. IMHE now projects masking would save 2,400 lives over the next three months. I know you are a strong pro-life supporter. Whether that number is half or doubled, we can save lives with a stroke of a pen. Digital Divide Delaying the start date and masking is not enough, Governor. If schools are reopened, a realistic expectation is that many schools will need to close at some point to deal with an outbreak. Thus, we need immediate action to address the digital divide issue. You should not be in this predicament. It is decades of failure. I apologize for my part in that failure. The digital divide puts a spotlight on our rural and racial divide. In 2020, children in counties with one-to-one technology, should not have a technological advantage over at least one-third of our state that does not. Even in counties with equipment advantage, every county has internet access issues. I understand this is not a quick fix, but I am also looking into the future. On March 15, 2021, the one-year anniversary of the school closure order, we likely will be dealing with covid. Our goal should be that no child will suffer lack of access after having a year to address. But, again, that is what we want. What we need is to do the work to ensure every child from Abbeville to York has access. Governor, I again want to commend you and your staff for the ceaseless work over the past four months on this public health crisis. I do not envy your position and responsibility. I am at your service. Sincerely, Representative Neal A. Collins District 5",1

"The history of RED Fridays… 4 score and roughly 7 years ago Oscar Mike (a veteran-owned &amp; American-made apparel company created by four paralyzed veterans in a two-car garage with a crystal clear business agenda to raise awareness and help raise funds for impactful veteran nonprofit programs) added blank red shirts to their inventory. We knew the current wars and our troops were no longer getting the level of public support or awareness they deserved while so many were still ... deployed/sacrificing and, as always, we wanted to do something small to do our part. So we created the R.E.D. (Remember Everyone Deployed) campaign and trademarked it to keep it out of Walmart’s, Nike’s and Under Armour’s hands. We just wanted it to remain pure and American-made if we could. Then something crazy happened…Under Armour’s marketing and legal teams reached out to our tiny little organization asking to license it from us. They weren’t able to produce the line in the US so we didn’t work out a deal. After that the USPTO got ahold of us to show us that we were in danger of losing our trademark because, according to the list they compiled, a ton of veteran organizations were now using it and we weren’t defending it…or suing them for using it. Instead of telling a thousand veteran organizations they couldn’t use it we celebrated and voluntarily released the trademark with huge smiles on our faces. It worked! Now veteran organizations can all unite behind a campaign to keep our troops overseas top of mind with all of their loved ones and supporters. Most Americans might not know someone currently serving overseas but we all want to do our part and unite over the right things and the people we love and respect. Wearing RED on Fridays is a super-easy way to do just that. And hopefully, you buy your RED gear from organizations that are doing great things…or making it in America…or have founders that have never taken a paycheck but continue to give everything they have to the mission… Keep America Oscar Mike (On-the-Move) &amp; R.E.D.

"Speaking “Truth To Power” About Climate Change: The Role Of Archetypal Energies Dr. Carroy (Cuf) Ferguson, Ph.D. One of the Archetypal Energies that I discuss in my award-winning book, Evolving The Human Race Game: A Spiritual and Soul-Linked Perspective (2017) is the Archetypal Energy ""Truth"". Speaking ""Truth To Power"" requires Understanding ""what is so"" and to authentically face and examine ""what is so"" with Courage in order to constructively act harmoniously to bring abou ... t change and transformation. The phenomenon of climate change requires such an approach. Archetypal Energies are Higher Vibrational Energies, operating deep within our psyches individually and collectively, that lead us, when accessed, toward our optimal selves and optimal realities. We tend to experience them as “creative urges.” Overall, I have identified twenty-five Archetypal Energies that can be helpful at individual and collective levels for all aspects of our lives, including the phenomenon of climate change. I will have more to say about them in relation to climate change and other matters in subsequent articles. Here, I want to briefly reference just a few of them as they relate to climate change—primarily Truth, with the supporting Archetypal Energies Understanding, Courage, and Harmony. (Note: I use familiar terms to evoke a common sense of these Higher Energies.)Truth is one of what I call Spiritually Integrative Archetypal Energies, as is Understanding. Courage is one of what I call Foundational Archetypal Energies, while Harmony is one of what I call Transformational Archetypal Energies. In speaking “Truth To Power,” on September 20-27, 2019, a Global Climate Strike was scheduled, starting with the Global Youth Climate Strike on September 20, 2019, followed by a Gathering at the United Nations on September 21st. And, then, on September 23, 2019, Greta Thunberg did an outstanding job of speaking ""Truth to Power"" at the United Nation Climate Action Summit. In this context, the supporting Archetypal Energy “Courage” was demonstrated with passion. Courage is and will continue to be needed and at play as the climate change drama continues to unfold. That is, we must all find and access the Archetypal Energy “Courage” within to speak ""Truth to Power"" about this global planetary phenomenon. It is noteworthy at this point simply to point out that, over the years, we (the Association and I) have not been on the sidelines in regard to the global planetary phenomenon of climate change, and the critical role that Archetypal Energies can play. For example, in June 2010, I wrote an article for AHP Perspective, titled “Mother Earth ‘Speaks’: Change Yourself, Change The World, Use The Archetypal Energy ‘Harmony’ As A Guide.” In that article, I stated the following: “In relation to the Cosmos, we all, as human beings, live on this tiny planet we call Earth, a planet that supports and sustains life, as we know it. There are many different kinds of people, plants, and animals functioning in harmony with soil, air, and water--all linked to one another in a complex web of life to form one Earth community. Unfortunately, we often take this miracle and ecosystem of life for granted. When, however, we take the ecosystem of life too much for granted, Mother Earth ‘speaks,’ reflecting imbalances and dis-harmonies. When Mother Earth ‘speaks,’ her message is a simple one: It's time for corrective action, to make a change--change yourself, change the world.” That “Truth” holds just as much “Power” today in 2019 and beyond as it did then in 2010. It is and can be used as a baseline framework for “Understanding” the phenomenon of climate change and successfully addressing the imbalances and dis-harmonies. We change ourselves by changing how we “think” about ourselves, and in turn we change the world. That is, if we see ourselves as separate and independent from each other and the planet as a whole, we construct that kind of reality at individual and collective levels. And, if we see ourselves as connected and interdependent Beings inhabiting one planet, we construct an entirely different kind of reality. In essence, then, when we change how we “think” about ourselves, we also change how we “think” about and deal with the world we inhabit. When the latter form of “interdependent thinking” is fully embodied as one’s Truth, individually and collectively, we “know” at a core level that in taking care of the planet, our climate, we are also taking care of ourselves. We can thus speak our “Truth to Power” about climate change with a sense of inner integrity and knowingness. AHP, therefore, fully supports all efforts to address and rectify the imbalances and dis-harmonies flowing from climate change. In that regard, some years ago, we (the Association and I) received an invitation for AHP to become an Affiliate Member of the Medical Society Consortium on Climate Change and Health . It was a no-brainer, as we all were instantaneously aware of the interdependent nature of our individual and collective Well Being and how that interdependence connects us all to the Well Being of the planet and the future of Humanity. Representing AHP as an Affiliate of the Consortium, I also had the privilege of helping to plan and to attend the most recent Consortium Annual Conference and Congressional visits that took place April 28-29, 2019 in Arlington, Virginia and Washington, D.C. It is important to note here that the Consortium and its Affiliates endorse the Global Call To Action on Climate and Health, and the domestic policy agenda called the “U. S. Call To Action on Climate, Health, and Equity: A Policy Action Agenda.” This domestic policy agenda is part of an overall effort to speak “Truth to Power” about climate change by many like-minded and “awake” people and organizations. While I reference larger scale efforts above, it is important to recognize that in regard to speaking “Truth to Power,” all efforts, regardless of how small or grand, matter in the short and long term for sustaining the planet and life, as we know it. We must all find the “Courage” to speak “Truth to Power” until there is global recognition and “Understanding” about the effects of climate change at individual and collective levels. With urgent and effective action NOW, balance and “Harmony” may and can become a natural way of Being on planet Earth.

"Well everyone -- first a good and blessed day to all :) I wasn't going to address this issue today but i feel from what i see going on around us --- its time ! I also don't like to get into politics because i feel dealing with the salvation of our souls and God to be way more important - but - from what i see and hear daily on almost all the media as well as us - the people of this country, it makes me sad and mad. I have to believe it is doing the same to God :( To bea ... r false witness is a evil sin. There are sins worse but not many and anyone involved in this is not only promoting evil but also committing it ! I see people making up lies about not only the person they are after but anyone around them or associated with them. Its one thing to make a honest mistake and correct ourselves when we learn the facts but i don't see this as the fact of the situation. I see the media - the politicians and even the people of this country plain bearing false witness on purpose to create havoc and to destroy other individuals reputation ! This is hate and evil fellow christians and folks ! When you hear the statement that evil exists because good people do nothing to stop it -- well here is a perfect example of the truth of that statement ! Honestly i think most of the people have totally turned their back on honesty and one of God's commandments ! This is a bad thing folks ! and i feel God has to be looking at it in the same way from what He teaches on the subject of bearing false witness and lying in general. In general i despise politicians but i was brought up to not say anything if i didn't have anything good to say --- so i don't have much to say about them -- but --- we are told to to pray for them and i do this. We all know that we are talking about President Trump and his family as well as those associated with him. I'm old enough to have lived through many presidents and i must admit that i didn't really like many - but - it never even occurred to me to lie about them or bear false witness to ruin their reputation ! Many christians just as myself, try to stay out of politics but none of us should stand by as we watch this happening around us. It amazes me that you can fire and get rid of about anyone else in this world of ours for lying and being deceitful but politicians ! They can lie and deceive and nothing is done ?? They tell us we can vote them out when their term ends but thats about it. Anyway - Please do as God tells us -- don't believe what you hear until you make sure its the truth ! Don't bear false witness about anyone and if you know of someone doing this, try to correct them in a christian way. Anyway again -- I noticed i haven't smiled once yet since my welcome and thats because it saddens me to write this. Bearing false witness really bothers me and it must God also if He had it as one of His 10 commandments. Time to end this and with a happy note. Jesus will be back one day and all these problems will be gone :) God Bless - Take care",1

"I remember approaching a former employer several years back, resignation in hand, to say that I was leaving a wonderful job to pursue studies in writing. I'll never forget the perplexity on his face as the silence ticked away between us after I broke the news. 'How you mean - writing,' he asked, 'what so you writing?' 'Stories,' I replied, 'like...fiction' At the end of the meeting, my manager had given me a year's leave (at no pay) and wished me God speed. He valued my work ... , he said, and if I needed a break, he was prepared to give me one. I didn't need to resign. My job, he said, would be waiting for me at the end of the year and on any occasion I wanted to come back during study breaks from learning to write the ...story. When I relayed what happened to a friend later, she thought it was the craziest thing she'd ever heard. Who, she balked, leaves a job like that to learn how to write story? And who does let them? Sometimes we all need a reminder that a story is important, is powerful, is a gift. Thankful for all the storytellers today.... What's the story you have to share?",1
"For Love and Humanity: Flat-out Free $24.49 New Hope Box! Plus Free Justice offer combines for a $40+ value with just $5 purchase — Four years ago today, 7-6-15, our President rolled out his campaign including the words: ""Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border."" No one with any sense of history has any doubts about who he was channeling. Four years ago many hoped this was not who he really was, but just a cynical ploy to stand out in a crowded f ... ield. But if there were any doubts or feelings this was just an act, on this the fourth anniversary of his launching his campaign with such cruel, calculated words, that doubt has long vanished. Each day as we learn more from the camps where asylum seekers are being separated from their children and concentrated in unhealthy living conditions, the toll of his dehumanizing of others becomes more clear. That so many Republicans have simply embraced the motto of the first lady’s “I really don’t care” jacket is actually kind of heartbreaking. Two years ago we did a giveaway on this anniversary to bring attention to his Nazi-style dehumanization of others just trying to find some way to bring attention to just how much more dangerous this president is to America, and the offer was well received. Yes, at least from the time of Nixon on, there’s been a pretty open embrace of racism by the Republican Party, but as truly horrible as racism is, what this president is doing is something much worse. To believe yourself better than others because of race is rotten to the core, but to arrive at the point where you no longer see others as even human is where things go frighteningly wrong. History shows again and again that unless we find a way to block the path the Republicans are now on or turn them to another direction, a whole lot of good, decent, innocent people are going to end up losing their lives. We can quibble about do we now have actual concentration camps in America. What is clear is that many-many republican voters are looking at camps where humans are facing intentionally-created suffering and seeing no real problem with it. If they are not objecting now, will they object to the next step, or the step after that? Hopefully we never find out. A big part of what makes Cooks so valuable is their ability to find the silver lining in every cloud. Those up to no good know the value in hopelessness. Over the years I’ve come to believe that what makes Cooks so valuable is that, no matter the message those up to no good are spreading, Cooks simply refuse to abandon all hope no matter what. Cooks Embrace Hope, always have, always will. And when times reach their worst, that hope makes all the difference. But I have to admit, for the last couple of years, for these July 6th offers I’ve had a hard time creating the sense of hope that, if we are going to live up to our Voice Of Cooking trademark, we always need to be able to find. This year is different. This year, finally, there actually is New Hope. Though you don’t see it brought up much these past few months, the 11.6.18 election changed everything. That was a good night. In the vote totals we all found the proof we so needed that real America is still very much alive. In the overwhelming rejection of republicans across the board, including twelve million more votes for Democratic Senate candidates than Republican ones, the true story of America was shouted from the rooftops for all to hear. The only reason this administration still holds the White House is because of the length of time between presidential elections. America doesn’t want him. And of course there is no reason to trust this president and his republican supporters in Congress. And there is every reason to fear the hurt he will inflict in the time he has left, so we must all work to minimize that hurt. Still, come the night of 11.3.20 one of League of Extraordinary Candidates the Democratic Party is now fielding will take back the White House for the people of this nation. As long as we don’t lose hope, as long as we get everyone we know to vote, and as long as we stand together against the inhumanity that has captured the Republican Party, the reality is, the future is already certain. Let’s all do all we can to keep hope alive! At Penzeys we’ve found that a good message travels far, but a good message combined with a great offer with your sharing has no limits to its reach. So for two days, through Sunday night 7.7.19, we are doing our best to shine a spotlight on the dangers of supporting this president while celebrating the decency and goodness of those his administration and the Republican Party seek to dehumanize with not one, but two great offers. The first is a flat-out free in our stores $24.49 value New Hope box. Online at penzeys.com To see all the goodness of the New Hope Box please click this link:",1

"Halloween and the End of the World On Halloween weekend, after listening to a terrifying and soon-to-be-famous radio show starring Orson Welles, many of the staff members and children at the Home for the Friendless were scared silly. In the middle of the broadcast, Mr. Welles announced that aliens were invading our planet. He sounded so afraid that the staff believed it was really happening. Some of the kids were afraid, but at eight years of age, I wasn’t. I didn’t even pon ... der the safety of my little brother and sister in their dormitory rooms on the other side of the building. I was curious, though. What if aliens did invade Cedar Rapids? Would they hurt us? Would the world be a big mess? However, none of that deep thinking kept me from sleeping soundly that night. The next day at school it was hard to do our lessons because the only thing the kids could talk about was that radio show and Orson Welles, the man who wrote the script titled ""The War of the Worlds."" The teacher even set aside our Palmer Method penmanship lesson so we could talk about what we had experienced. My third grade classroom at Polk Elementary School became a solid mass of arms in the air with hands wiggling, each kid begging to tell his or her story. I didn’t dare say anything. What would they think if I said that I hadn’t even been worried about my little brother and sister? I wish I HAD been frightened so I would have something to say. Arthur said, “I was scared to death, and I hid under the bed for a long time.” Violet said, “Not me. I knew it was a joke.” Phillip said, “It was not a joke, just a misunderstanding.” Phillip was very grown up. A boy whose father worked at the police station said someone phoned and asked, “What time is this going to happen?” A girl whose father was a fireman said a lady called the fire department and asked, “When it happens, shall I close my windows?” Another student said when her mother checked on an elderly neighbor, the woman said, “I don’t have time to talk right now! The end of the world is coming and I’ve got a lot to do!” We all laughed about those stories, even the teacher. Then she told us another story, turning it into a lesson. “While I pull down the map, be ready to raise your hand if you know the answer to my question.” I was not good at geography so I didn’t budge. “There is a college in Brevard, North Carolina, where the entire student body panicked during last night’s radio show. Who can tell me what the word panic means?” Phillip’s arm shot into the air. “It’s the button my mother pushes when she loses her marbles.” “Phillip, explain for the class what you mean by pushing a button and losing her marbles.” “Well, when our new puppy went potty in my mother’s lap, she screamed and tossed the pup to my dad. My dad said that she had lost her marbles and hit her panic button.” “So, Phillip, do you know what your dad meant by that?” “I sure don’t.” “Boys and girls, the word panic means being so frightened you lose control and do things you wouldn’t ordinarily do.” “You mean like my mom throwing our puppy in the air?” Phillip asked. “That’s right. Now, who would like to locate the state of North Carolina?” Up jumped Bernard, Mr. Map himself, to point with pride at the state of North Carolina. Our teacher said, “This is the location of the college where the students panicked during the broadcast.” Then she read from a newspaper clipping: ""Five students at Brevard College in North Carolina, fainted and panic gripped the campus for a half hour with many students fighting for telephones to ask their parents to come and get them."" If a pin had dropped in my classroom, we would’ve heard it because all of the kids sat wide-eyed and speechless. We listened to every word as our teacher went on: ""A radio broadcast is usually heard by the whole country. So try to imagine how many other people were afraid last night and how many of them probably panicked. Every kid nodded in agreement while she continued: ""When large groups of people become frightened by something they can’t see, they sometimes do strange things to get away from the fear. It’s called mass hysteria and it means that fear is sometimes contagious, like the measles. That night after supper, all of the kids and staff at the Home gathered close to the big Zenith console to listen to the news. A lot of people were really mad about the show being broadcast, especially on Halloween. I felt sorry for Orson Welles because he probably had no idea what a ruckus he would cause. When a reporter asked himBut, But what he thought about the commotion, he said, “I apologize to the producers of the CBS Mercury Theater for this getting out of control. The show was only a story and not real. That’s why we announced a warning at the beginning.” “But, Mr. Welles, anyone who tuned in late didn’t know that,” the interviewer said. “The broadcast seemed so real that everyone was confused.” “I am so sorry. I don’t think we will ever broadcast that program again.” While listening to the show, I had been a little bit confused, too, but I didn’t think it was real. Maybe growing up with such hullabaloo in my family had taught me to take things in stride. When bad things happened in the adult world, like kidnapping and bank robberies, I felt certain the grownups would take care of it. After listening to The War of the Worlds, the nervous grownups at the Home must have caught fear from each other. But, I was GLAD the world hadn’t ended on Halloween. It would've wrecked our costume party, and I was really looking forward to stuffing my face with candy. from ""The Home for the Friendless"" by Betty Auchard",1
"At the end of the revolutionary war for independence, Lafayette said, ""Humanity has won its battle. Liberty now has a country."" But where did it go? Who squandered it? Are we not intelligent enough to see it? Are we not ""the people"" to restore it to full glory? If John Adams were here today, he would say, ""The prospect is chilling, on every Side. Gloomy, dark, melancholy, and dispiriting. When and where will the light spring up?"" Let us start from the beginning, the beginnin ... g of the United States. According to John Adams' letter to Abigail Adams on 1776 July 3, ""When I look back to the year 1761... from that time to this, and recollect the series of political events, the chain of causes and effects, I am surprised at the suddenness as well as greatness of this revolution."" This revolution was not a unanimous decision by every one of the 13 colonies. Only about a third supported it, another third didn't want the separation or were sympathizers, and the last third was not for or against it. In reality, less than 20 percent supported it one way or another. Those who were dedicated and invested their time and money into it was less than 10 percent. Only about 5 percent sacrificed their time, finances, property, or their lives—considering the population was less than 4 million, about 200,000 people were responsible—for the United States we have today. The process was not that of a small minority hijacking a cause or a country but a representative democracy; it is what we have today, called a republic. Do we all count in this system? Yes, in the sense that we all have one vote. No more, no less. At the same time, it is optional because it is your right to exercise your rights and not the function of government to force you to exercise your rights. Yes, it's a beautiful system. We vote to elect a representative to represent us, and this is called the representative government. In other words, we have a republic to secure God-given rights, more specifically, life, liberty, inanimate property, and the pursuit of happiness. Now it is time to ask the questions stated at the beginning: At the end of the revolutionary war, Lafayette said, ""Humanity has won its battle. Liberty now has a country."" But where did it go? Who squandered it? Are we not intelligent enough to see it? Are we not ""the people"" to restore it to full glory? Thomas Jefferson said, ""I like the dreams of the future better than the history of the past."" The people of today are hardly the future he had in his dreams, but the situation doesn't have to be the sad predicament that it is today. We have the power to change for the better, to be that dream the founders had in mind. Thomas Jefferson said, ""the will of the people is the only legitimate foundation of any government."" Or, was Benjamin Franklin right in wondering, it is a Republic, but can we keep it? There is a certain need to protect what's given to us actively, or else there is attrition. It disappears slowly without us knowing. The masters of the craft of liberty are all dead and long gone. It is for us to speculate on what it means to have the full extent of their dream for the people of the future and the nation they founded. What is our responsibility to them, and even more importantly, to recover and pass it on to the future?",1

"Part 2 of 4 “We established Hoo's Woods Raptor Center in 1998. One night, my husband at the time and my children and I were sitting around this little campfire in the backyard. One of my kids said, ‘Whose woods is it, Mommy?’ Meaning: does it belong to the birds or to us? I said, ‘We all have to share it.’ It was just so fitting. That's how we came up with the name Hoo's Woods. It started with a little red shed in my backyard, which we quickly outgrew. Today we have a large b ... uilding with a clinic, numerous enclosures, outbuildings, aviaries, and a large flight area for eagles. My kids grew up with it. When they had special projects at school they would ask, ‘Mom, can you bring an owl to class?’ At first it was pretty cool, but it's like having a dog. The first dog, it's exciting and fun, and then it just becomes part of everyday life. But I think my children really see value in what we do. I started out as a rehabilitator, and then I took on three education birds. The birds we use for public education are non-releasable because of a physical or psychological impairment. They can’t survive in the wild. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Wisconsin DNR allow them to be used for public education programs and exhibits to teach about their natural history, biology, and conservation. I really wanted to get into educating people because I felt so passionate about the birds. I've been doing educational programs for 20 years now. Today, I have 12 trained education birds for our programs. We're considered to have one of the top collections in the state. We speak to a lot of children, we visit a lot of schools, libraries, conservation clubs, senior citizen groups, and more. In our presentations, we talk about where raptors and wildlife fall into the ecosystem and how they benefit the world. We talk about the birds individually so that people learn about their biology, and the historical side of them, the hazards like DDT and lead poisoning. We talk about how to encourage habitat preservation, and what happens when we don’t, like the example of the barn owl. We haven't had a nesting pair of barn owls in 40 years in Wisconsin due to loss of grassland habitat. In 2015, the Wisconsin Wildlife Federation called me and said, ‘Congratulations, you are Wildlife Conservationist of the Year.’ Literally, you could have knocked me over with a feather. I thought, ‘Me, really, seriously?’ They invited me up to this award ceremony. It was very humbling, and I was very honored to be there. The award says, ‘In recognition for your outstanding accomplishments in making a significant contribution to wildlife resources in Wisconsin during the past years.’ As a result of our programs over the years, we've had groups that have made kestrel nesting boxes, or screech owl boxes, or just wanted to restore habitat or do something to help the environment, even if it's going out and picking up trash on the roadsides. It’s so amazing when a kid comes up to you after a presentation and says, ‘I want to be a biologist. I want to work with birds. I want to make a difference. I want to help.’"" -Dianne Moller | Milton, WI",1

"Violent white nationalist attacks take place at different times, in different places across our country, but they share much in common. They were intended to create fear. They were motivated by hate and bias. And they are incompatible with our values and have no place in American life. Unfortunately, the current administration has chosen to ignore the threat posed by white nationalists and affiliated violent extremists. Donald Trump has openly stoked these fires. He has cozi ... ed up to white nationalists — even hiring some, like Stephen Miller, into his White House. Trump has made one racist remark after another. He has put in place racist policies, from the Muslim Ban to his ongoing effort to build a monument to hate on our southern border. Hate crimes spiked after Trump’s election, and last year violent personal attacks reached a 16-year high. Donald Trump wants to divide us -- to pit worker against worker, neighbor against neighbor. He wants Americans to blame their troubles on those who are new to our country, or who don’t look the same or pray the same or love the same, even as his administration robs us dry. But America can be better than that. We can be a country that prioritizes the safety of all our citizens. Because when we fail to prosecute hate crimes, we send the message that the victims are less valued.

"One of my favorite Scriptures is Galatians 5:22-23 describing “The Fruit Of The Spirit”. These two verses are by far the fastest way to gauge our relationship with God there is. It is a tool that keeps us real about who we are and who we are following. Let’s keep the end in mind. Love God with all your heart, mind and soul. Love your neighbor as yourself. With Jesus’ life, death and resurrection there came a new covenant. We no longer had the law to go through with all of the blood sacrifices and atonement; Jesus was the complete sacrifice and atonement for our sins and there are now were only the two commands. They are worth repeating. Love God with all your heart, mind and soul. Love your neighbor as yourself. This sounds so simple. It is not. To love God with ALL YOUR heart, mind and soul is not a Sunday afternoon stroll through the church as we tick the box. The “ALL YOUR” anything means with all your intentional focus. This is not a hobby! To love God with all your heart, mind and soul is a total commitment, not a contribution. If we pursue a “relationship” with God, where we love Him with all of our heart mind and soul, that makes Him the first thought, not an afterthought. It means that when we wake up, He is the first thing we think about. We spend time in His Word with a fervent, deliberate focus on getting to know Him more. We would think about Him and His view on the things in our lives and circumstances we face. We would want His input. We would be careful to treat Him with respect, dignity, and careful consideration. We would be certain to always remain faithful and avoid anything that would threaten our relationship with Him. We would want our actions to bring Him joy and not discomfiture or sadness. ~~~~~ That is what passionate love is. When we love God with passionate intentionality, we can then love our neighbor as ourselves the way God loves us. This leads us to the “Fruit of the Spirit”. It is with these same attributes listed in the “Fruit of the Spirit” that God Himself demonstrates His love for us. Paul presents The Fruit of the Spirit here in Galatians: “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, forbearance, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control. Against such things, there is no law.” Galatians 5:22-23 NIV “But the fruit (produce, bounty, harvest) of the (God’s) Spirit (disposition, temperament, attitude, nature)” are the characteristics of God which He has demonstrated to all of mankind and the way in which He did so. In essence, these are the result of His love evidenced with His Son and Holy Spirit. Love; in this context, is a verb. Paul describes it this way: “Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, and always perseveres.” 1 Corinthians 13:4-7 NIV ~~~~~ Joy meaning happiness, delight, pleasure, enjoyment, and gladness. Peace is quiet strength in the midst of trouble, the freedom from quarrels and disagreements, free from strife. Forbearance is the act of being patient, self-controlled, having restraint, tolerance, and strength. Kindness is the quality of being friendly, generous, and considerate. Goodness is related to the state or quality of being good; having moral excellence, virtue, and goodness is the best or most valuable part of anything. Faithfulness is adhering firmly, devoted, loyal, responsible, conscientious, dependable, reliable and consistent with truth. Gentleness is being considerate or kindly in disposition, amiable and tender, not harsh or severe; mild and soft. Self Control is the ability to exercise restraint or control over one’s feelings, emotions, and reactions. “Against such things, there is no law.” These are the attributes of God. When we spend time with Him, read His Word they become evident in our lives. They become the filter with which we view and act in our everyday encounters and activities. We back up and balk; we can’t possibly attain all of these virtues in our lives. It is too much, why should we even start? There is truth in that statement, and alone we cannot attain these virtues. That is where Jesus and the Holy Spirit come in. Jesus gave us an example of how to have these virtues in the midst of extreme turmoil, challenges, pain, and sorrow. He spent time with His father, regularly and often. He depended on the Holy Spirit for strength and grace. When Jesus was being baptized, He came up out of the water and the Spirit settled on Him, became a part of who He was. ~~~~~ There are times that our circumstances overwhelm us. We feel like there is nothing left in us to love, to give, or to go farther. Often we don’t see ourselves slipping. When we drift from God being the focus of our love and we become self-centered in our love; when it’s all about me. Then we start to slip. When the feeling is, “I deserve this, I want what they have, I need more of…, I’m entitled to that, I’ve had enough”. We all know the list; it is filled with “I”.Now is when we need to pull out the “Fruit of the Spirit”, the barometer of our relationship to God and see what needs to change. This is when God steps in and gives us all we need to go on, to succeed, to get up, to give out, to love more with a grace we cannot imagine. Today can we make a list of the “Fruit of the Spirit”; with their definitions and put them in a place we can see them easily? Is it time to take paper and pen, settle in on our own inventory, just God and us? Can we just hit the pause button in our lives and consider who the focus of our love really is and then adjust?",1

"I'm grateful to Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Jenny McCarthy, Mark Blaxill, Dr. Paul Thomas, Dr. Chris Exley, and Jennifer Margulis, Ph.D., all of whom have provided reviews of my book (included below). The book remains at #1 in the Autism/Asperger's category, because of the choice of so many of you to pre-order the book, which will be released on September 19th. Thank YOU for your support, and if you haven't pre-ordered, I hope you consider doing so. “J.B. Handley is arguably the ... world’s most thoughtful, sophisticated, knowledgeable, and indefatigable activist for children’s health and safety. As a frontline leader for fifteen years, Handley has led the big fistfight against the Pharma Cartel to force the issue, broadcast the science, and expose the lies behind the vaccine policies that have created an epidemic of chronic disease among our children. Handley has helped bring the issue of toxins in medical products and regulatory corruption to a tipping point. Handley’s advocacy has lifted the curtain of lies behind which the autism epidemic has sprouted. When we end this cataclysm, it will be thanks to the dogged character of people like J.B. Handley who have refused to rest in his battle to support parents, protect children, bring justice to injured families, and to punish those responsible for one of the worst scandals in American history. Please read this book and decide for yourself if you still believe that vaccines are ‘safe and effective.’” ―Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. “I honestly believe J.B. Handley wrote the book that will end the autism epidemic. As I sit here now, in stillness, I want to jump up and down with excitement, but I’m holding back rivers of tears. He breaks down the scientific information in a way that doesn’t intimidate the reader. And he lets us know it’s okay to be angry. His soul, his fight, his love for his son radiates off the pages. Wow. Bravo, bravo.” ―Jenny McCarthy, author of Louder Than Words; coauthor of Healing and Preventing Autism ""This book is inspired, powerful, the unadulterated truth, and a must read. We have sacrificed too many children at the vaccine altar while our blind belief in the CDC and AAP, government, and the media has prevented us from seeing the conflicts of interest that enable big business and Big Pharma to profit at the expense of our children’s health. How to End the Autism Epidemic is one family’s story, but it is sadly also a story shared by millions of families. A beautiful normal baby, vaccinated, and then lost to autism and all the horrible medical conditions associated with immune devastation and brain toxicity. Thank you, J.B., for sharing your story and wisdom. Parents and future parents: Read this book now, and say No to business as usual and the status quo. If your pediatrician has not yet done his or her own research and is just parroting the ‘vaccines are safe and effective’ marketing phrase, it is time for you to get a new pediatrician.” ―Paul Thomas, MD, coauthor of The Vaccine-Friendly Plan and The Addiction Spectrum “As parents our job is to be concerned about our children’s health. Yet every day in doctors’ offices around the country, American parents are told we are being ‘irresponsible’ or ‘selfish’ just for asking questions about vaccines. We all want to keep our children safe and healthy, both from infectious diseases and from overexposure to toxins. It’s reasonable to be concerned that there are too many vaccines on the schedule and that medications like antibiotics, acetaminophen, and ADHD drugs are being over-prescribed. What’s a worried parent to do? For starters, read this book! Sharing his personal story as the father of a boy with autism and taking a close look at the most recent and rigorous science, Stanford-educated J.B. Handley shows how the CDC’s aggressive childhood vaccine schedule is connected to the astonishing rise in autism in the United States. How to End the Autism Epidemic is a direct challenge to the American public health establishment and a gift to the millions of parents who find themselves caught in the crosshairs―uncertain of what to think or do―of the seemingly intractable debate about vaccines.” ―Jennifer Margulis, PhD, author of Your Baby, Your Way; coauthor of The Vaccine-Friendly Plan “I have been thinking about the toxicity of aluminum for thirty-five years. It is my life’s work. Before we completed our recent research on aluminum in brain tissue in autism, I could not see a direct link between human exposure to aluminum and autism. I certainly saw no immediate role for aluminum adjuvants in vaccines in autism. The missing link was a mechanism whereby the brain would be subjected to an acute exposure to aluminum, for example, as occurs in aluminum-induced dialysis encephalopathy. Pro-inflammatory cells, some originating from blood and lymph, heavily loaded with a cargo of aluminum in brain tissue in autism provided that missing link. We all tolerate the toxicity of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines. Unfortunately, some of us are predisposed to suffer, as opposed to tolerate, the toxicity of aluminum adjuvants, and this may cause autism. Autism is a disease, and it is not inevitable. J.B. Handley’s elegant synthesis of what we know and what we need to know argues that autism could and should be preventable. I agree with him.” ―Professor Christopher Exley, PhD, fellow, Royal Society of Biology; professor of bioinorganic chemistry, Keele University “J.B. Handley tells it like it is. His new book is a masterful synthesis of all the latest threads of autism: the controversies, the science, the legal and policy battles, and the human dimension of the ‘movement’ that has inspired so many of us to become parent activists. Peppered with jaw-dropping new developments―including depositions from major vaccine science luminaries―Handley weaves a compelling narrative and cuts through the noise to make a powerful and convincing case. Read it. Process what he’s telling you. And then stand up and do something about it. The health of generations of children is at stake.” ―Mark Blaxill, coauthor of The Age of Autism, Vaccines, 2.0, and Denial # defeatautismnow # cureautismnow # endautismnow # myautism # berniewasright # readthebook # theautismbook",1

Maybe you would also circulate my words (below) through CWR? And as we find that our voices are silenced by our local paper's policies, may we all speak up at the polls. In truth and civic engagement, Heather This week brought one of the biggest “dress up” days of the year: people of all ages donned costumes for Halloween. They dressed up for parties and to walk neighborhood streets. They also dressed up for work. My cashier at the grocery store was a cat. My intake nurse at the dermatologist, Minnie Mouse. And my colleagues in the English department, a “ghost writer” and “the grammar witch.” While a number of teachers dressed up Wednesday to celebrate the holiday with their students, Halloween certainly is not the only day on the school calendar when teachers wear costumes. In fact, one likely would be hard pressed to find a teacher -- regardless of whether they work in a public, charter, or private school, and regardless of their area of specialization -- who has not dressed up at least once in their career. Teachers in costume celebrate milestones like the 100th day of school. They boost school spirit through “tacky” and “throwback” fashion days. They rally students behind causes: in our county, most notably wearing pink for breast cancer awareness. Teachers in costume work Fall Festivals to raise money for their schools and student bodies. They promote brand, identity, and belonging by wearing school colors. They foster student engagement by bringing story characters to life. Who hasn’t, for example, heard of Dr. Seuss Day? Great Expectations was the first book I read for high school English, and I remember feeling pleased as punch that I’d read and understood a Dickens novel. I also remember celebrating that accomplishment with my classmates and teacher -- in costume -- over Miss Havisham’s wedding breakfast. This was almost 30 years ago. Routines are vital to good classroom management, but professional educators also know that a little bit of novelty can go a long way in generating interest, holding attention, and promoting retention. According to Scholastic, whose magazines and books have been a part of our classrooms for nearly a century, “More and more schools are promoting thematic dress up days because it helps to build class/school spirit, develop community, encourage creativity and imagination, challenge kids to think outside the box, promote attendance and participation, and celebrate hard work.” Dress up days are a way to support and extend student learning. The means of novelty may require us teachers to look a little silly on occasion. But when the ends are positive learning environments with invested students and cohesive student bodies, who can mock us? Who would? Only someone who neither understands nor values the work of the teaching profession. Heather Childress Custer",1

Last Day - $9.95 for $41.36 worth of who we are. ——Please take notice of the way America this weekend took notice of the life of Senator John McCain. As the reality of what the Republican Party has become gets exposed through our court system in the coming months, there will be the question of can the party even survive and should it even survive? In the months to come it will become clear that all those elected leaders who supported, enabled and obstructed for this administ ... ration have to go. Some of them to jail. But what then? The Party’s future’s uncertain, but in its past there is a roadmap to a place where it was possible to be conservative without working hand in hand with our nation’s adversaries to undermine America’s values. Today the Republican Party is undeniably the party of racism, environmental destruction, and of taking health care from those in need, all to funnel the nation’s wealth to the party’s already wealthy benefactors. What actually caused the Republican Party to rise up were values the very opposite of those it exhibits today. There once was Abraham Lincoln fighting for the Republican Party’s founding principle that slavery was an abomination. There once was Teddy Roosevelt fighting to make environmental conservation the bedrock of this nation. And, too, there once was John McCain who, among his many battles, successfully fought to make the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) the law of the land. From now until November 6, we all must do all we can to save our country from what the Republican Party has become. But come November 7 the struggle will still be far from over. Unraveling what unlimited political spending has done to our country is the battle of our time. As much as 11.6.18 must be our main focus, we are Cooks, we have proven we can multitask. As we all sit down to dinner tonight it’s time again to start thinking of the way forward. As their Ronald Reagan said in his farewell address: “Let me offer lesson number one about America: All great change in America begins at the dinner table.” It is time again for Great Change. We weren’t planning for this, but with the addition of the two 1/4-cups of Arizona Dreaming in honor of the spirit of Senator McCain, today became a pretty good day to visit one of our stores, or spend some time with us online at penzeys.com.

"Why I'm Still in the Race: Running for County Legislature for District 3 has taught me so much about our County and our communities and I hope you will vote for me tomorrow. I found out how truly puzzling it is to run for office, to understand the deadlines, all of the paperwork, and especially the lingo. I found out the ways in which having money and/or a privileged background can really make a difference for how well you are able to navigate the system. I found out how few ... working-class people and people of color serve in public office or ""officially"" participate in local politics in our County and thus where there are significant lacks of representation of ALL residents in local policy making. I found out how difficult, and sometimes painful, it can be to be the only (if not one of the very few) young(ish) woman of color at many of the meetings and conversations that take place around local policy making. In the end, I found out why so many people cannot, don't want to, and won't run for local office. And I can really appreciate those decisions. But I am still on the ballot under the Working Families Party line. Because I believe in a Living Wage for ALL, I believe that we ALL contribute to the County, whether we own homes or not, I believe in the right for ALL of us to have adequate food, shelter, and a happy life, and because I believe in democracy.

Thanks so much, your friends and servants at TCL.. ... End of Update).*** We’re in the middle of the biggest emergency this country has seen in decades. We’re in for some trials and we’re going to have to rely heavily on God and each other. Having this community and this ministry is a comfort when so much seems backwards, upside-down and insane. This nation is in crisis. God makes it abundantly clear through the OT Prophets, through Jesus and through many New Testament writers like James (brother of Jesus) that we are to defend the weak and the oppressed. We are to speak up for those with no voice. We are to care for the poor, the sick, the homeless, the hungry, the oppressed, the incarcerated, and basically anyone who lacks fundamental necessities or rights. These are not instructions intended only for individuals. God gets very upset with nations, city-states and kings who ignore these requirements throughout the OT. It is now more important than ever for this ministry and this community to survive and thrive. We must remain a lighthouse on a hill as the perfect storm gathers. Now is the time to stand strong, with a new resolve, as things will likely get much worse. Now that right-wing extremism has grown stronger we must all stand in the gap, especially given that most “Christians” now accept it as their core ideology. In the present darkness we must increase the light. We must speak up now more than ever: Right-wing ideology and the teachings of Jesus are opposite in nature. They can’t be reconciled on any level. Most of us have been told we “can’t be a Christian and a liberal … because liberals are baby-killers, perverts, abominations, and God haters!” We’ve been told “liberal Christians are an oxymoron!” Most of us have experienced sitting in church listening to the pastor praise the Republican Party and send all liberals to hell. We’ve experienced wanting to run out of the service screaming and never come back. All these things and more are imprinted in our minds and it almost gives us an anxiety attack just thinking about it. If we don’t stand strong it’s going to get worse. Who will be left to speak the truth? Very few groups like ours exist and none do what specifically what we do. This is a safe place where Christian progressives can gather, discuss the events of the day, support one another and welcome allies who see what is happening as well. Social media has made it possible to band together from all over the nation in one place, even from deep in the middle of the reddest states. Wherever Christian progressives live, they no longer need to feel alone.

"Ok folks. It is election time, once again. Right up front, I am begging anyone that reads this to share it, share it everywhere. We need this to go viral. I know that you have heard this stuff about how important this midterm election is, but please hear me out. The special counsel is busy with his massive investigation of election fraud, and it is has been over a year since it started. Republicans have been screaming and whining that it is taking too long, despite the fact that investigations of this nature are notoriously complex and long lasting. In fact, this particular investigation is like Warp 5 when compared to special counsel investigations from the past where they run at 60mph. But the problem is that even if he reveals that Trump has conspired with Russia to throw the election toward him, even if he did violate election finance law by paying off famous women of the sex industry (porn stars and models) to hush about his toadstool affairs, even if he did sexually assault someone, even if he lies to everyone about everything, evades taxes, fleeces the US government through his excessive golf trips to his own resorts, violates the emoluments clause of the US constitution, and/or breaks the law in some way that I haven’s thought of or remember trump is going to have the support of ignorant, backwoods, half toothless morons that barely have an elementary understanding of civics. Remember, they also have the right to vote. Trump has abused the power of the Presidency, we all know this. He is also one of two presidents that have lost the popular vote, and have collectively appointed 4 judges, that do not represent the majority of the people, to the Supreme Court. Republicans have had the entire government in their control for going on 2 years, and have done mostly nothing for the majority of the people. What they have done, is taken every step possible to thwart an independent investigation into the administration that has been underway since Trump has been in office. They have done everything in their power to strongarm the judicial appointment process. Ryan, McConnell, Grassley, Nunes, Gowdy, and any other Republican official that has anything to do with enabling this erosion of the American Government should be removed from office. This election is not just a typical midterm election, it is putting an emergency brake on this administration’s abuse of power. It is taking our country back from the Oligarchs that use their money (that they made on our backs) to buy our government out from under us. It is one of the primary reasons that our country was founded in the first place: We pay taxes and we are not adequately represented. Our voices are not heard in this Republican Vacuum. Big Corporations are drowning out our voices by spending massive amounts of money to legally bribe our representatives. They don’t have the accountability of citizenship, or the right to vote, but they have an unreasonable amount of influence in our elections. Allowing Republicans to run our government has proven to be a colossal screw up of nearly biblical proportions. It is literally the most important one in my lifetime. So, make sure that you vote.",1
"Gathering Together As We Weather This Darkness: As our country inches closer to authoritarianism every day, our government scapegoating and vilifying the least of these in the eyes of Jesus, ripping immigrant children from their mothers and putting them in cages where their screaming can be heard outside, we find ourselves in dark, evil times led by liars who praise murderous dictators and castigate our allies. We watch horrified as the majority of “Christians” in the US, 81% ... of white evangelicals, not only support the atrocities taking place, the environment being destroyed, health insurance being ripped away from those who can’t afford it, rampant corruption and profit taking from the President and his family, trade policies being put in place that are well-known to crash the economy, unnecessary walls being built, Supreme court rulings that deprive employees access to the courts, massive tax cuts to corporations and billionaires while wages have remained stagnant for decades, tax policy that results in corporations taking their tax cuts and moving manufacturing plants abroad, these “Christians” will shout you down for even questioning what they support. They have abandoned Jesus. They have become a cult. They know nothing of Jesus and his ways, of the things he taught. There are very few places left where Christians who have NOT forgotten about Jesus can gather, discuss the events of the day, support one another and welcome allies who see what is happening as well.

"We usually know exactly what we don’t want to do. But knowing what we want to do &amp; acting on it, can be more elusive. Why? Fear of it not working out? This is certainly a possibility, but if we don’t try going forward, we stay exactly as we’ve been yet possibly less happy for not trying. Is it worry that others will throw shame at us? Trying to make us feel we’re being too egotistical or grandiose? Yes, there will be haters &amp; those that feel your desires threaten theirs. Of c ... ourse this is ridiculous thinking…but it doesn’t change the fact that you’ll be regularly reciting: “Sticks &amp; stones can break my bones, but words will never hurt me.” Uncertainty of the unknown? This is illusory because whether we act on what we want to do or not: Nobody has a better crystal ball for tomorrow. Only experience tells us it likely won’t be linear &amp; direct. Finances certainly factor in: Changing may require sacrifices that may be uncomfortable. Time? We all get 1440 moments each day. From prophets to inventors &amp; everything in between: Everybody gets the same time in a day; it gets down to how we choose to use it. Lack of confidence? Accept we all suffer from this, even if it doesn’t look that way. The only way to build confidence is challenging ourselves over &amp; over again. Complacency? Possibly because when we’re comfy, we are rarely in re-invention mode…and for the record, we don’t ever have to be! But things we can do, like learning a new skill, instrument, language, etc. will keep our brains sharper. Life history is a big factor against changing: We’ve likely experienced enough life-altering experiences, so we really need to ask…do we want another? Maybe, maybe not. Lack of belief? This is where we need to have some faith in God, the Universe or the Cosmic Forces of Life. Believing that something bigger than us wants our one-of-a-kind, unique self to wholly manifest.

"Guilt GUILT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY for wrongdoing. Apart from the wrong we are each of us responsible for personally, in a sense no wrong is done anywhere that we are not all of us responsible for collectively. With or without knowing it, either through what we have done or what we have failed to do, we have all helped create the kind of world mess that makes wrongdoing inevitable. The danger of our guilt, both personal and collective, is less that we won't take it to heart th ... an that we'll take it to heart overmuch and let it fester there in ways that we ourselves often fail to recognize. We condemn in others the wrong we don't want to face in ourselves. We grow vindictive against the right for showing up our wrong as wrong. The sense of our own inner brokenness estranges us from the very ones who could help patch us together again. We steer clear of setting things right with the people we have wronged since their mere presence is a thorn in our flesh. Our desire to be clobbered for our guilt and thus rid of it tempts us to do things we will be clobbered for. The dismal variations are endless. More often than not, guilt is not merely the consequence of wrongdoing, but the extension of it. It is about as hard to absolve yourself of your own guilt as it is to sit in your own lap. Wrongdoing sparks guilt sparks wrongdoing ad nauseam, and we all try to disguise the grim process from both ourselves and everybody else. In order to break the circuit we need friends before whom we can put aside the disguise, trusting that when they see us for what we fully are, they won't run away screaming with, if nothing worse, laughter. Our trust in them leads us to trust their trust in us. In their presence the fact of our guilt no longer makes us feel and act out our guiltiness. For a moment at least the vicious circle stops circling and we can step down onto the firm ground of their acceptance, where maybe we'll be able to walk a straight line again.

"Many of us in the black community and beyond are familiar with “the conversation” that black parents feel they must have with their children—especially black boys—about how to interact with police. These urgent conversations are happening because there is a fear in this country about the consequences that disproportionately, unequally, and unfairly affect young black children. The unfortunate reality is that we have a justice system in which blacks and Latinos are treated di ... fferently than whites. We know factually that blacks are much more likely to be stopped by police and get longer sentences for the same crimes as whites. We know factually that there is no difference in the rate of blacks and whites dealing drugs, but blacks are 3.7 times more likely to be arrested. Not addressing this implicit racial bias in our justice system is having a severe impact on the financial and overall well-being of countless individuals and families—as well as well as delegitimizing a system that proclaims to uphold equal justice under the law. We all need to do our part to speak out on this issue, and create a powerful national dialogue to address this issue so that we are able to affect change.",1

"Recently, two prominent GOP Congressmen, Representatives Mark Meadows (NC-11) and Jim Jordan (OH-4), have called for the firing of Attorney General Jeff Sessions for recusing himself from the Mueller Investigation. These two politicians think that a man who was highly active on the Trump campaign, and who himself could potentially be part of the Russia investigation, should be fired because he didn’t intervene on the President’s behalf in that investigation. Expressing one’s ... desire for political interference into independent investigations at the very same time one is accusing the Justice Department of bias is the height of hypocrisy and subverts legal precedents. Not to be outdone, last week Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) demanded a new special investigation into Christopher Steele, the author of the Trump Dossier. Despite having no public evidence of wrongdoing, they insist that Steele has likely committed a crime. Their behavior prompted Senator Feinstein (D-CA) to release the transcripts of the Fusion GPS interviews. In those interviews, the firm’s founder details how Steele was so alarmed by what he found out about Russia’s engagement with Trump’s campaign that he felt duty-bound to bring his findings to U.S. law enforcement. Neither of these stunts by Trump enablers in Congress are honest attempts at truth or justice. They aim solely to protect the President’s power while securing their own, just like you would see in a banana republic. For the sake of the country we all love, we must step up our actions to protect Mueller’s important work. We must send a message to Speaker Ryan and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that efforts to undermine the Russia special counsel won’t stand!

"The hatred and divisiveness in this county has gotten to a critical point. There are times when I’m talking to my Republican friends it feels like we are not even on the same planet. This has to stop! All of us must learn how to get along with each other. We are a nation of immigrants. From our looks to our opinions we are all different. But it is those differences that make us strong. Those differences built this country into the great nation it is today. Our differences sho ... uld not be what tears us down! I’m running as a democrat because the Democratic Party stands for things I have always believed in. Everyone is created equal. White, Black, red, green, polka dotted, gay or straight, man or woman, we are all in this together. If we can’t get along with each other we will be destroyed! Every US citizen has the right to vote. Democrats register voters. Not all of them vote our way but that’s ok. Informed and active voters make our country stronger. Proposal 3 makes it easier to register and vote. Proposal 2 to end gerrymandering ends one party rule. This does not give anyone an advantage over the other. It insures majority rule and a government that is responsible to the voters, not special interests. High quality public education is everyone’s right. The reason public education was started in the first place was because a quality “private for profit” education was only available to those who could afford it. We should not go back to that kind of system. Every child deserves an equal chance to take advantage of what this great nation has to offer. Public school funding must be restored! Social Security must be protected. Republicans want to cut Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Tearing down the social safety net for our seniors is wrong. We all pay that money in so we can live out our retirement years with dignity, respect, and independence. You paid that money in, you deserve to get it back. People have the right to quality healthcare. The healthcare system in this country is broken. Anytime you have a free market system and you’re not getting the best quality product at the lowest possible price you know something is wrong. Next year I will be starting on Medicare. My monthly premium will go down 400 percent and my 10,000 dollar deductible will go away. Cheaper and better is cheaper and better! The environment must be protected. If we want to leave our children and grandchildren a quality way of life we need to act now. A lot of people are afraid of change and new ideas to power our country. I like to remind people that the world is always changing. There is a reason we don’t have stage coaches and blacksmiths in every town anymore. The automobile came along and those jobs were eliminated. Renewable energy offers the potential for millions of jobs! We can either embrace change and prosper, or we can be left behind!",1

"It’s only been a couple days since Republicans realized they had the votes to pass their tax monstrosity and already their arrogance is palpable. They’ve given their big money puppet-masters a gigantic windfall. Their overlords are very pleased and they know it. Now they can get away with some big talk. Trump is already of course saying ‘this is the biggest thing in the history of the world!’ We all expect that from carnival barkers. That’s only the beginning. Now Republican ... leaders have set about trying to discredit the Mueller investigation and they’re demanding that Mueller ‘wrap it up soon.’ Excuse me? Since when do those being investigated get to demand a quick end to the investigation? Trump has essentially hired a bunch of bandits in his administration and they're looting the economy after Obama fixed the damage Bush inflicted. They're running off with the internet, all the money and surpluses we've gained, all the economic stability we've gained, all the respect we've gained, health care coverage we've gained, the list goes on. Every sector is being pillaged. Next they'll be coming for Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. They'll say we simply 'can't afford' these 'entitlements' any longer. Nevermind that all their tax cuts and fund-raiding will have caused any shortages in these programs. You are witnessing the wholesale destruction of a nation by professional criminals. What's worse is that most of them claim to be ""Christians."" It's literally, physically sickening when Trump, Pence and and their band of con artists start talking with their fake ""Christian"" gibberish. It's so obviously disingenuous it begins to make your head spin. Then your stomach goes.

Here in Boulder, it's happening, I was a member of the Campaign Finance Reform Committee in 1999 that put the wording together, circulated the petitions, got the measure on the ballot, and then cele ... brated with many folks when we won 63% of the vote. This work is widely accepted today to limit contributions and spending and to level the playing field for candidates who don't have large amounts of money. And very importantly, it provides transparency in campaign committee expenditures since all expenditures must be reported to the city clerk.

Campaign finance rules were set in place to assure the public that: (a) excessive campaign costs and large contributions do not cause corruption or the appearance of corruption in the election process; (b) large campaign contributions will not be used to buy political access or to influence governmental actions; (c) access to large amounts of money will not be a prime requirement for participation in the political process. To the extent that unreported funds by non-candidate organizations are being used to fund push-pull polls, print political materials which don't use the word ""vote"", but show pictures of their preferred candidates, to the extent that the any actions violate the spirit of this law, I promise to be involved in a strengthening of the law if I am elected.

Enjoy light food, drinks and a short film about the Wild Olympics Campaign created by Patagonia and American Whitewater and a speaker to share more about this work they are doing. All donations will benefit Washington Wild! Did you know that over 16 million Americans source clean drinking water from watersheds in Washington State? Our communitie ... s depend on healthy watersheds, which start at the tops of our snowy mountain peaks and flow through our wild rivers and dense forests. Washington’s wild rivers are essential to this process as they guide pristine water through low-elevation forests and into downstream communities. However, the federal protections for free flowing rivers are limited, leaving them open to dam projects and road construction that can harm water quality. Washington Wild is a founding member of the Wild Olympics Coalition, a group working to designate the first Wild and Scenic Rivers on the Olympic Peninsula. These designations are the strongest a river can receive, and ensure these areas are protected for generations to come. If passed, the bill would protect iconic rivers such as the Elwha and the Hoh. We hope to see some movement on this bill in 2018, and we need your voice to amplify its importance!

"***WE NEED YOUR HELP! We need you to march with us this Sunday in the St. Pat's for All Parade to loudly demand the safety improvements in Sunnyside that every cyclist and pedestrian in Queens deserves.*** You know the story. A proposal for protected bike lanes comes out, and naysayers emerge to protest the removal of even one parking spot. Straight out of Orwell, people use concerns for safety to argue against safety improvements. Calls for dialogue and conversation are used ... as weapons of delay. Meanwhile, thousands of pedestrians and cyclists remain at risk as the safety plan fades away, and people's attentions move on. We didn't think this sort of story would happen in Western Queens, not in Sunnyside. But here we are. With the December Town Hall having been postponed indefinitely, the safety improvements for Skillman and 43rd Avenues in Sunnyside and Woodside have inexplicably stalled. Well, enough is enough. It's time for us to come together and use our strength in numbers to remind everyone why this plan is so desperately needed: riding your bike or crossing the street shouldn't be a death sentence. ***Join us on Sunday, March 4 at 1:30PM to march in the St. Pat's for All Parade as we demand these safety improvements be implemented for the thousands of cyclists and pedestrians who travel on Skillman and 43rd Avenues daily.*** Don't forget: almost one year ago, delivery cyclist Gelasio Reyes was killed on 43rd Avenue at 39th Street while biking home from work. In response to his death, the community--including Gelasio's family, Council Member Jimmy Van Bramer, Community Board 2 Chair Denise Keehan-Smith, and advocates--came together to call on the DOT to design and implement a plan that brought protected bike lanes and other safety improvements to the vital connector routes on Skillman and 43rd Avenues. DOT did their job. Now it's time for us to do ours and fight to get that safety plan implemented. The cyclists and pedestrians of Sunnyside and surrounding Queens deserve nothing less. ***Sometimes you have to fight for what you need. This is one of those times.

"Mindfully Working with an Angry Brain Part 1 of 4 Part 2 will be posted Tomorrow Do I have an angry brain? At times I sure do, I have a brain that will blow up like a volcano if it was not trapped in my skull. I do not have an angry brain all the time, just some of the time. It can happen when my teenage boys forget to do the chores, even though I left a note on the kitchen table. Or when someone tells me upsetting news and I do not have any control of the situation. You kno ... w the irritating life stuff that we all face. Anger is a normal response of the brain when a situation appears threatening. It is a primary emotion that is well established at birth. Yes, it is actually a good thing. It is our internal radar that screams “life threatening situation! Be prepared to fight, defend, and concur”. It serves all animals well in protecting their lives, their families, and their territory. However, the issue is that this emotion is triggered over chores not being completed or situations we cannot control. I do not need the flight/ fight response to be activated to conquer my teenage children or in a situation I cannot change. Actually I have found that I make things worse when trying to solve an issue from an angry brain. I evaluate income information incorrectly, I cannot truly understand another’s point of view, I over react, and often say something off topic that just escalates the anger. I also have found that my angry brain is contagious. It seems that when I let it leak out others catch it and it multiplies. Then I don’t just have one angry brain but an epidemic of angry brains on my hands. The epidemic creates misery for everyone. I have chosen to make sure that the epidemic of angry brains will not start with me. I know that anger is a normal emotion that I will continue to have. I am okay with this. Through mindful living I learned how to work with my angry brain instead of fighting it. I am able to listen to the warning signs that my brain is telling me, and still not feeling like a need to fight and conquer my family or the customer service representative.

It is obvious that a vote for Pritzker is a vote to make Madigan the de facto governor of our great state. It is also EQUALLY obvious that a vote for Rauner is a vote to allow Madigan to CONTINUE to be the de facto governor of our state. We all know that a Pritzker governorship would put the Chicago Democratic Machine in total control of Illinois state government, which would be the death of our great state as we know it. We also know that Rauner is a FAILURE, and would bring four more years of the SAME failure to the Governor’s Office. We simply cannot afford four more years of ANY elected official that allowed veterans to become sick and even die, while DELIBERATELY suppressing details of a deadly epidemic at the Quincy Veterans Home for self-dealing political gain. The Illinois attorney general has appropriately launched an investigation into criminal wrongdoing on the part of Rauner and his administration. I call on the Attorney General to request that the US department of justice and the FBI, take the lead on this investigation. The last thing we need is a progressive Chicago Billionaire who, as the Inspector General of Cook County just reported, allegedly orchestrated and engaged in a scheme to fraudulently reduce his own property tax burden, while the rest of us struggle to keep our heads above water with the ever-rising onslaught of higher and higher property taxes, year after year. Unlike PRITZKER, I will work to remove Madigan from his record-breaking term as speaker, where he keeps a STRANGLEHOLD on the People of Illinois. Unlike RAUNER, I wont have to ask Madigan permission to “be in charge.” (as he infamously confessed in Chicago on December 4th 2017.) It should go without saying, that the governorship of a major state does not come with ""on the job training, "" you have to be ready to LEAD from day one. I am the ONLY candidate running for governor that is prepared IN EVERY WAY to lead our state into a STRONGER and more PROSPEROUS tomorrow. But I can’t do it alone. THIS is where you, the People, come in. YOU, (not the media, not the parties, and definitely not Madigan) are in control of this election. I implore you to BE BRAVE enough to vote for the Illinois that you WANT, not the Illinois that the dueling parties, the lobbyists, the billionaires and the backroom dealers have convinced us (for far too long) is the best that we can do. We CAN do better, and we WILL do better. I am asking for your vote to be your next governor of Illinois. Let’s rebuild Illinois Together."" Senator Sam McCann - October 3rd 2018",1

"Over the summer there has been a lot of talk about the “Blue Wave.” Will it happen or won’t it happen? Personally I don’t think that it will. But this isn’t because I don’t believe in change or think that it isn’t coming. I have to believe in change. We all have to believe in change if we are going to make this a community where we can all thrive. I guess for me though, the change isn’t a wave. What I see going on is a “great negotiation.” Yesterday at the Christine Brow ... n rally, Zahra Roach related an encounter she had with a die-hard Republican she met while canvassing. During the course of her conversation with him she was able to earn his vote. He went on to say he would not be voting for any other Democrats, but a simple conversation about the issues was able to win over at least this level of trust. This morning a woman commented on this very page that her die-hard Trump supporting son voted for me because he figured if by her estimation, we could be Facebook friends, then I can’t be so bad. He’s still a solid Republican but again another vote was earned. All around our community we are having these conversations. We are talking to our families. We are talking to our friends. We are talking to our colleagues. I think what is changing is we have learned to listen. We have learned to have the difficult conversations and try to approach matters from a place of empathy rather than shutting down out of frustration. We are holding thousands of negotiations about what we value, how preserve those things and also how to grow our community into a place where we can all be happy and succeed. So really it isn’t that I don’t believe in change. I just wonder if the image of a wave is the right metaphor. We are not trying to overpower anybody. We are just trying to make our home be the best place it can be. We have a couple weeks to go. Keep up the conversations. With work and trust I think we will come to look at this summer and fall as the “Great Negotiation.” Thank you!",1

Unfortunately, the tens of millions of dollars of ""dark money"" that funded his opposition's disgusting smear campaign, won the day. Rather than do their own research, many voters believed the lies and Bucks lost a unique opportunity to have an exceptional representative in Congress. Instead, we are stuck with a man who won't even meet with local residents and supports the ugly agenda of the president. With Wallace's loss, we all lost.

While certainly exhausting and at times frustrating, running for Okeechobee County Judge in my beloved hometown has been one of the most amazing experiences of my life. I’ve been inspired by your ideas, your efforts, and your passion to ensure people of character represent our community. Even though the falsehoods and personal attacks against me were deeply disap ... pointing, the phone calls, texts, and messages of support and encouragement that so many of you offered uplifted and energized me more than words can capture. I know the vast majority of you share my belief that our judicial system must remain independent and unblemished by cronyism and political opportunism. Vigilantly safeguarding against any attempts to undermine our judicial system is the only way to ensure justice for every Okeechobee resident who appears in a courtroom. I want to believe that on this basic point my opponent and I agree. But his silence in the face of attempts to curry his favor by misleading voters gives me little confidence. That’s OK. My confidence is in God and in each of you. I will continue to give it my all till the final second, but having stood up for my values, stood up for the truth, and stood up to protect the independence of our court system fills me with a sense of peace that surpasses any political campaign. Thank you, Okeechobee County, for being such an incredible place to grow up. Thank you, Okeechobee voters, for taking part in this nationally significant election. Thank you, Okeechobee residents, since whether or not you grant me the privilege and pleasure of serving as your Okeechobee County Judge, I will still have the privilege and pleasure of being your neighbor in this small town.

"You Can’t Make Up Stuff This Good!!! This past week, we all learned that Sara James, the Texas-based campaign operative working for Brat, has been using powers given to her by Brat to drive pro-Brat narratives on his Facebook page and deleting constituent comments that did not fit this narrative. Anyone who cares about democracy and public discourse ought to be dismayed by this, but for those who appreciate irony and hypocrisy, the whole story would make a great after-school ... special. Consider the following: -When faced with a nationwide movement opposing President Trump, Representative Brat and others on the far right, Brat dismissed the movement as nothing more than “paid protestors,” “paid activists,” and people “being paid to go around and raise havoc.” -When asked about the fierce opposition he was encountering at his Town Halls, Brat deflected the opposition, saying that many of the attendees were from out of his district. -When asked by his constituents for his opinion on white supremacist Richard Spencer’s upcoming rally in Charlottesville, Brat responded not by condemning white supremacy, but by defending Spencer’s right to free speech. So....Dave thinks it’s bad if out-of-staters are paid to raise havoc and that everybody’s right to free speech should be respected. If that’s so, then why was Dave paying a woman from Texas who spent her time criticizing his constituents and, using authority granted to her by him, deleted their comments from Facebook page?

"California voter rolls were hacked in 2016: We all have heard how the current Secretary of State was incompetent when he rolled out the DMV motor voter program. The DMV motor voter has adversely affected hundreds of thousands of Californians. However most Californians have not heard that the DMV debacle was just another example in the long list of incompetence demonstrated by the current Secretary of State. Did you know that in 2016, the current Secretary of State rolled out ... an online voter registration process that hackers were able to use to change voter’s party registration so that they were not able to vote in the presidential primary. The current California Secretary of State had no safeguards in place to protect us from hackers and had no system to track the hackers so they could be caught. The current incompetent California Secretary of State has proven that he is reactive rather than proactive. Rather than protect the voter rolls from hackers, he simply waited until the problem was discovered and then he attempted to fix the problem. Time and time again, the incompetent Secretary of State has shown he cannot anticipate the most likely threats to our voter systems and protect us from them.

"We’re glad to see that Tim Berners-Lee, properly honored as the father of the World Wide Web, is taking action to curb the abuse of power by the Big Tech platforms. However, after years of espousing the false gospel of “internet exceptionalism” – a theory that for some reason the internet should be above the law – his change of heart is way overdue. It’s true that Berners-Lee has warned of the potential for companies to act irresponsibly since at least 2009. But where was he ... while Google and Facebook built the mammoth platforms that scaled up these abuses? It was the utopian view of the internet as an unmitigated force for good on the part of Berners-Lee and others that helped get us into this mess. Capitalizing on this, the internet giant convinced legislators to absolve them from responsibility for misuse of their global networks. Now, we’re all paying the price. Isn’t it ironic that we’re sharing this message with you through Facebook? But where else would we go? Whether it’s search on Google or social on Facebook, they have truly become gatekeepers on whom we all depend. We appreciate Berners-Lee owning up to his regrets. But we can’t wait for him to achieve another utopian dream to solve it. The internet here and now needs fixing… before it’s too late.",1
"A friend sent me a post that she had seen that claimed that white people have evolutionary reasons to fear other races, because they have “stronger genes” that could lead to our “extinction.” She asked me to respond. I am posting my reaction first, so that there can be no misunderstanding that the original post has any valid merits!!! I am posting the original post beneath for reference. My response below. First thing. An unnamed “African American sociologist“ gave this lecture? Yeah. Right. My first reaction is that this person has a seventh grade understanding of genetics. Black fur in mice is, indeed, dominant over white fur. It is a simple Mendelian trait and is controlled by one gene. If a mouse has both a black and a white form of that gene, they will be a black mouse. However, this is emphatically NOT how skin color (or hair texture, or any other trait you could attribute to race) work in humans. The list of human traits that are simple Mendelian is shockingly short- I know because this fact is super irritating when I try to introduce genetics to my students! So I have perused the whole list to try to find the few examples they would give two hoots about!!! Most human traits, including skin color, are polygenic. They are controlled by dozens, or even hundreds, of genes. Currently, science knows about 378 genes that control skin color in humans. For every one of those 378 genes that is functional, your skin is a little bit darker. For every one of those 378 genes that is mutated and non-functional, your skin is a little bit lighter. This is why humans are not binary black or white. Instead, there is a vast spectrum of skin colors from alabaster to ebony. Despite the fact that skin color is a spectrum, with absolutely no separate groupings whatsoever, we can glance at a person for just a few seconds and easily classify them as “black” or “white.” Why is that? The reason has nothing to do with biology and everything to do with our racist colonial history. When we had slavery, many, if not most, slave women were raped by their white masters. The slave-owners needed the resulting mixed race children to be unquestionably considered slaves. (Even when they were their own sons and daughters.) So they came up with two legal rules to ensure that mixed-race slaves didn’t have a legal argument for freedom. First, by law, a child’s condition was that of the mother. So even if your father were the president of the United States, you were a slave if your mother was. (AS indeed happened in the case of Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings.) The second legal precedent that they came up with was the “one drop rule.” In other words, if you had ANY black ancestry, you were considered black. The end. The “one drop rule” has colored and biased our thinking in ways that we can’t easily perceive. If a person who is black and a person who is white have a child together, we only PERCEIVE that child to be black. In truth, for every trait that we perceive as racially specific, the child will land somewhere in the middle. We perceive someone in the middle as “black” because we have been taught to do so. Do you want proof? In Brazil, race was perceived differently for historical reasons. In Brazil, a mixed race person is considered to be white! A Brazilian person and an American person could look at the exact same human, and see the exact same biological features, and the Brazilian person would see a white person while the American person would see a black person. Same thing for “red and white” and “yellow and white.” I have a friend who is mixed Lakota and European. He has blue eyes and blonde hair. The only way that a person could possibly think that mixed race folks would “destroy” white people is if they believe in race purity and superiority. And trust me, biology does NOT back them up. As for global warming, it can’t have any effect on skin color, because skin color is not an adaptation related to temperature. And luckily for the racist who wrote this post, the use of CFCs has been outlawed internationally and the ozone hole is closing. (They are luckier for this fact than they might know. If the ozone hole had expanded, we would not all be black. We would all be dead.) The post to which I was responding: “This is a long post but worth reading. It is a lecture I give to my history classes: Years ago, I listened to an African American sociologist explain white fear/hatred. I almost turned the channel until she said, ""At the end of the day, we are mammals...with the same fight or flight responses to inherent and present dangers."" Okay...I'm listening. ""White people SHOULD be afraid of people of color because we are the end of them."" I lean in, prepared to turn off tv. ""Let me ask you this...if you have a cage of black mice and you pour them into a cage of white mice....what will the offspring be?"" I lean back now, fascinated. ""More black mice, because that's the dominate gene. Black and white mice, and which is the weaker gene? White mice. So now, you have a cage with less white mice. So we let that cage, which is, of course, represents the world, we watch them breed. Browns and whites mean less whites. Blacks and whites means less white, Reds and whites means less whites, yellow and whites means less whites...are you following me?"" I am riveted. Her biology is undisputed. No matter who you are, you cannot disagree with this scientific fact. So, if you know people who hate people of color for no apparent reason, there is a biological imperative for a species to fight against anything that threatens the species...are you still with me?"" I balk at species, but keep listening. ""Now this is where it gets interesting. As the world has opened up and we no longer live just in one place, we are all mixing races...which is going to be necessary because...there's that little hole called the ozone layer and a little thing called global warming."" I cock my head in question. Where is she going with THIS? ""With unchecked UV rays hitting the planet, what skin tone is least likely to be able to handle those UV rays?"" My hand goes ti my mouth. ""Oh wow."" ""Which skin tones can better handle what we are doing to this planet? Again, we are talking about science here...not politics, not religion, not my own personal beliefs. Science. Facts. We are evolving away from single races in order to survive, because we all know Darwin's theory of survival of the fittest, and if we continue to have blended families, to move about freely around the globe, the eventual extinction of the causasoid race is inevitable...at the very least...it will become, like the white rhino and the white tiger, a tiny minority on this planet."" I cannot refute the science of this. So I look up reptilian brain: Because its only concerned with our survival and the reproductive success of our genes, it will motivate us to always be as efficient with our evolutionary strategies – to move away from pain towards pleasure. This means that the reptilian complex subconsciously determines our decisions, making us find out the most cost-effective solution to our behaviors. Even to our bad behaviors. ""So,"" she finishes. ""We keep looking for the WHY of racism, when we should be looking at the HOW to tame that part of our brain which sees people of color as a threat...which we are by the very nature that our genes are stronger than any white genes we might procreate with. That sentence alone will cause white people to sputter and rage, wanting it not to be true...but wanting science not be be factual is a waste of energy. Quite simply, we are evolving, and we are doing so because if we do not, we will, most assuredly end up with the dinosaurs."" Fascinating...don't you think? Thanks for reading. Whatever your leaning, this is just a very interesting way of looking at race relations.”",1
"GOOD NEWS! The National Trust for Canada has announced this morning that the Minchau Blacksmith Shop in Old Strathcona has officially made it onto the Top 10 Endangered Places List in Canada. This will bring much needed attention to its historical relevance and to a wider public and political platform, but, much work is still needed to SAVE THE MINCHAU BLACKSMITH SHOP as it still does not have an official registered designation. Bad news! The Minchau Blacksmith Shop has made ... it onto the Top 10 Endangered Places List in Canada. Its fate is hanging in the balance right now as are so many historical buildings across Canada. The fact that it has gotten this far, and so close to possible demolition, is loudly indicative of the ""rights"" of developers everywhere and the acquiescence of our governments. Note that ""weak legislation and inadequate financial incentives"" in Alberta are a main threat to historic structural buildings, giving developers far too much reach. Fortunately, there is a groundswell movement happening right now which is being felt and recognized. As we spread the word farther to STOP THE DEMOLITION OF OUR HISTORICAL BUILDINGS and more people become aware and write letters to our municipal and provincial governments (and federal), it gets more difficult for the government elect to ignore the issue at hand and the people who voted them into office. We can only hope that some developers have a similar sense of community and will also step up to the plate and help preserve our Historical Heritage Buildings.

PLEASE SEE BELOW FOR EMAIL ADDRESS TO SEND LETTERS TO. Ironically, Blacksmiths were the cornerstone of growth and development for their communities in every part of the world and throughout history. In our short Canadian farming and industrial history, blacksmiths were the critical component in advancing our country and our society to an equivalent status as that of Europe and other countries, particularly in the early part of the twentieth century. Homes, buildings, vehicles and industrial equipment were no longer held together by tongue and groove boarding and wooden pegs: homes and buildings incorporated nails and other metal and steel implements in their construction and became more solid; wagons gave way to carriages and then automobiles; the walking plow gave way to better farm tools, equipment and tractors, and all because of a blacksmith's knowledge of metals, forging and welding, and his required skills. We all share in the benefits of modernization. And we all share in the history that precedes it. This should not be so difficult for our governments to recognize the value of the two, that they can in fact co-exist together, side by side, each with their own intrinsic beauty, and thoughtfully forged together, with the precision like that of a blacksmith, to build a bigger, better, stronger and healthier society. We as a nation recognize our Historical Buildings as important to the value of our heritage. We as a nation, and as Edmontonians and Albertans, recognize our heritage as important to the value of being a Canadian citizen. If developers and our governments continue to neglect and demolish our Historical Buildings, there will be no heritage left. There will be no tangible connection to our past. To developers and our elected government body of officials, we are not against the fair and reasonable development of new buildings or new ideas, we all share in the benefits of modernization, but WE STAND AGAINST THE DEMOLITION OF OUR HISTORICAL BUILDINGS. Please Designate the Minchau Blacksmith Shop an Official Registered Historical Heritage Site and Stop the Demolition! We thank the National Trust for Canada in recognizing the historical and heritage value of the A. Minchau Blacksmith Shop in the Historical and Cultural District of Old Strathcona, and for placing it on the Top 10 Endangered Places List in Canada. We know our work is not done and we value our relationship with your people in Ottawa! If you are new to our Page, take a moment to read through the previously written posts and please take a moment to send an email to the Provincial Government and to City Hall. Help us to stop the demolition of the A. Minchau Blacksmith Shop in Old Strathcona and to have it DESIGNATED a Historical Heritage Site via the Provincial Government.

"Happy Sunday, I’ve been doing a lot of thinking this week. What do I want to do differently this year that I didn’t do last year. I tried to quit running my businesses last year, enjoying time without counting it, and focusing on me (I have rarely ever done this in my 47 years around the sun). As it turns out, I learned a lot of valuable lessons. I also decided if I was ever going to try this political thing I better get back in shape. Cause thinking about traveling our stat ... e, shaking hands and figuring out if Tennesseans see what I see on the circuit of politics, and the need for a new narrative, will not be something I can convey if I’m out of shape? Here’s what I know: I can’t do this without building a team. I can’t do this without my partner being on board I can’t do this without understanding how running a campaign works I can’t do this without working on me (so I decided to do this one first) My kids, my mom and almost everyone else in my life do not understand why I might want to run for a Senate seat. I try to explain to everyone it’s just something I think I can be good at and bring a different perspective to people. I like to problem solve and build things, while working with people in a genuine way. I feel our country is at a crossroads, and financial product sellers and buyers are out of touch with average working people. One generation of business men full of fear and another generation of men wondering where they fit in. And women in between. Who do we want to be when we no longer look like we know each other anymore? Corporate cults are running endlessly through our financial good will, and nothing, I MEAN NOTHING, should ever be for free. It’s like I told several institutions in our city, the moment The CHATTANOOGAN became free was the moment institutions in our town stopped caring for people and started subsidizing hate and fear, not opportunity and engagement in our town. Sponsoring free speech is worse than paying poor people to commit terrorism, because largely people don’t ask who is paying for this opinion-news when they read something for free. And why is their brand name not on other opinion news outlets? I believe FaceBook should be required to charge something over nothing for us to be on here. Even if it’s a $1 and a federal regulatory charge. This way, we all have skin in the game. As far as I can tell, FaceBook has now been elected as the regulator of free speech for businesses in our country, yet no Tennessean sits on their board of directors. This is important when discussing anti-competitive business issues. Citizen’s United will need to be readdressed in Congress not in the courts, because the lack of court expansion in this country has clogged our federal pipes. It will take decades for court cases to make their way through this process now. Don’t even get me started on state courts. Until we the people realize why all of this is important to our liberty, especially our economic liberty, nothing will change. Those who are poor now, will remain poor forever, they’ll just have to travel further for work. And Rec center kids like me will be a dying breed. It’s just this simple. God help the middle classes.. I think Steve Schmidt put it best: “How did Donald Trump get elected president for me is pretty easy: 44 percent of Americans do not have $400 of available cash. There are more payday lenders than there are Starbucks. And there are almost more payday lenders than McDonald’s and Starbucks combined. There hasn’t been a real wage increase in this country for working people for [many years]. The defining fact for this generation was the economic collapse of 2008. What should people think, when the bankers get a trillion-dollar bailout and no one goes to jail. Thirteen million American families are foreclosed on — no small number of them being told by a deputy sheriff to get all their belongings out of the house in 45 minutes; 12 million Americans lose their jobs. One set of rules for everybody up here [meaning the top of the socioeconomic ladder]. another set for everybody down here. So how is it that a Bernie Sanders voter in the primary votes for Donald Trump in the fall. … All the elites are scratching their heads and saying, “They’re voting for crazy.” No. The elites are out of touch. … People in the middle third of the U.S. population know three things: that they are one missed paycheck away from disaster; that their kids will be worse off than they are; and, three, that there’s a much better chance of them falling into the bottom third than that they’ll climb up into the top third. People in the bottom third see an opioid epidemic. They see declining life expectancies. They see rising maternal death rates. They see no positive indicators anywhere. So yes, when a demagogue comes along and says, “Make American great again,’ it means three things: We were a great country. We’re not anymore. Put me in power and we’ll be one again.” This is a picture of my grandfather Cecil Kinkead, an Erwin, TN printer by trade who I got my body type from. This is a picture of my grandmother, Betty Kinkead, who taught me the power of critical thinking alongside the thought that most human beings don’t care about anyone but themselves. I miss my grandparents everyday. ~Michele Peterson “An Entrepreneur from Scratch”",1
"Penzeys! NOW WITH EVEN MORE HOPE &amp; OPTIMISM! Strength does not come from building walls or driving others away. Real strength comes from welcoming others in. Happiness, too. I get emails that argue that just because we support Republican politicians it doesn’t mean we’re not good people, when of course that’s exactly what it means. Penzeys Pepper is our 2018 Spice of the Year. This really is good Pepper. Since we introduced Penzeys Pepper in August of 2015, for every jar of ... Penzeys Pepper we’ve sold or given away through a promotion like tonight’s, we’ve given an additional exactly the same jar to the groups and organizations that work to feed those in need. We introduced this idea not so much to send a message, but more just to bridge a divide between those with so much and those with next to nothing. To us, both sides of this divide sharing in something really good seemed like just our kind of opportunity to do something really good. So Penzeys Pepper was born. But now August of 2015 seems so long ago. Back then we saw the need in this divide as on the side of those who have so little. These days, with all that our nation is going through, I see the need being at least equally as great in those on the side that have so much. I look at our president and wonder at how someone born to such privilege could end up desiring to use that privilege to place extra obstacles in the paths of those who already face so many-many obstacles. Hasn’t the refugee mom or the transgender high school student trying to use a restroom already faced enough obstacles for one lifetime? And what is maybe even more heartbreaking is that 30% of American voters cheer him, believing themselves good for supporting him while he makes these people’s lives so much harder. As a Cook I see what could have been if only there had been someone in his life to provide for a regular loving and welcoming gathering around the kitchen table. Cooking is where our humanity comes from. The farther we get from sharing that humanity the harder it is to see ourselves in their suffering. That someone so short on empathy should be leading our nation is something we all must work to offset. Where we didn’t introduce Penzeys Pepper to send a message this year, next year and the one after that, clearly it is time to send a message. And that message is there is a larger world around us that each of us owes so much to. This is great Pepper. You will use it a lot, and each time you do, please let it be a reminder that each of us has been lifted by those who came before us. What really makes America great is our caring for others and our working for their success, too. Each of us has the ability to make our success lead to the success of others.

"ARE WE HERE AT THIS POINT IN TIME, LIKE THE PEOPLE IN GENESIS WERE? Posted by: admin on Wed, Oct 10, 2018: It is time to come home to Jesus to be Saved by him or be condemned by him, It is all up to you,so what are you waiting for? ARE WE HERE AT THIS POINT IN TIME, LIKE THE PEOPLE IN GENESIS WERE? By Jimmie W Warren (Genesis 6:5-7) “ And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart. And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.” GOD MAY BE READY TO SEND OUT THESE SEVEN ANGLES OF REVELATIONS OUR TIME? (Revelation 16:1-20) “ Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, ""Go, pour out the seven bowls of Yahweh's wrath on the earth."" The first angel went and poured out his bowl on the land, and ugly and painful sores broke out on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped his image. The second angel poured out his bowl on the sea, and it turned into blood like that of a dead man, and every living thing in the sea died. The third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood. Then I heard the angel in charge of the waters say: ""You are just in these judgments, you who are and who were, the Holy One,(YEHSUA Messiah) because you have so judged; for they have shed the blood of your saints and prophets, and you have given them blood to drink as they deserve. ""And I heard the altar respond: ""Yes, Lord God Almighty, true and just are your judgments."" The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and the sun was given power to scorch people with fire. They were seared by the intense heat and they cursed the name of God, who had control over these plagues, but they refused to repent and glorify him. The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was plunged into darkness. Men gnawed their tongues in agony and cursed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, but they refused to repent of what they had done. The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the East. Then I saw three evil spirits that looked like frogs; they came out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet. They are spirits of demons performing miraculous signs, and they go out to the kings of the whole world, to gather them for the battle on the great day of God Almighty. ""Behold, I come like a thief! Blessed is he who stays awake and keeps his clothes with him, so that he may not go naked and be shamefully exposed. Then they gathered the kings together to the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon. The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and out of the temple came a loud voice from the throne, saying, ""It is done! ""Then there came flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder and a severe earthquake. No earthquake like it has ever occurred since man has been on earth, so tremendous was the quake. The great city split into three parts, and the cities of the nations collapsed. God remembered Babylon the Great and gave her the cup filled with the wine of the fury of his wrath. Every island fled away and the mountains could not be found Look around at all the sin going on all around the globe, men and women killing each other for what? Wars every where you look and it is only getting worse, is it not? You need to wake up to the world events that is taking us to the doom and end of all mankind ! Today we are closer to Nuking each other than we were in the 50's and 60's , It is just a matter of time when some dictator pushes the button, or our own President making every other ruler with the bomb push their buttons and boom 90% of us will not be here ! Again are we near the end of these evil days ? And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually. Are you or your families ready for the day of the Lord? Just think about all that has to happen before Yeshua/Jesus comes back? Do you even know what your bible says about the Last Days or End-Times? Do you say to yourself “ I am a Christian and shall except all the horrible things that will befall mankind ” but, Are you really? Are you following what Christ taught in the New Testament? Are you as close to God as you think you are? Do you even really know Almighty God “Yahweh” and his only begotten son “Yeshua /Jesus” by whose name you or I are SAVED? Where are you going to stand at the end-time judgment day? (Revelation 20:1-14) “ And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key to the Abyss and holding in his hand a great chain. He seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil, or Satan, and bound him for a thousand years. He threw him into the Abyss, and locked and sealed it over him, to keep him from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended. After that, he must be set free for a short time. I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony for Jesus and because of the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or his image and had not received his mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years. (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy are those who have part in the first resurrection. The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years. Satan's Doom When the thousand years are over, Satan will be released from his prison and will go out to deceive the nations in the four corners of the earth-Gog and Magog- (possible Russia and China)-to gather them for battle. In number (200,000,000) they are like the sand on the sea shore. They marched across the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of God's people, the city he loves. But fire came down from heaven and devoured them. And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever. The Dead Are Judged Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. Earth and sky fled from his presence, and there was no place for them. And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Another book was opened, which is the book of life. The dead were judged according to what they had done as recorded in the books. The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each person was judged according to what he had done. Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death. Do you study his word” “ the Holy Bible”, or do you just sit in some church somewhere and listen to some man or women read from it, or from booklets? Some of these churches claim to be the ONLY TRUE CHURCH OF GOD -head quarters and they only print Gods word to better clarify the bible to better serve you! Maybe you have heard of these kinds of churches even in one of them now? Maybe you follow a man who calls himself the Vicar of Christ ( Vicar means in place of—) from Rome! Maybe or maybe another city like Salt Lake City where they have an Leader-Apostle who is figure like God making all the choices for their people , or maybe you are a Jehovah Witness or maybe a member of the World-wide Church of God or their break off churches where some men claim to be from God? All of them plus many, many more CLAIM TO BE THE ONE TRUE CHURCH? How can they all be the ONLY TRUE CHURCH OF GOD? Don’t you think you should know what Yeshua/Jesus really taught and what Yahweh our Father God wants you to know about him and his soon coming kingdom? ( 1 John 4: 1-6) “ Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God, and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the Anti-Christ, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already. Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. They are from the world; therefore they speak from the world, and the world listens to them. We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error. Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God. Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love.” ALL WHO SAY ""JESUS CHRIST IS NOT THE SON OF GOD, IS A LIAR AND THE TRUTH IS NOT IN THEM! Do you know how to study your bible ? Or do you just follow along with your minister as they read if the read from it at all? Now there are some who read from articles of the church paper or pamphlets or from booklets given to them from head-quarters then preach as if these booklets were from God himself ? Most of these even though they are made up from church or man made doctrine are told you that they are reading from Gods word! Please DO NOT LET RELIGION TRICK YOU , READ AND STUDY YOUR OWN BIBLES SO YOU KNOW THE TRUTH! Have you ever asked yourself, WHAT IF MY MINISTERS ARE WRONG?” Where would that put you and your family? After all it is your eternal life that is at risk !! I am asking you to think about what you are being taught in your church and the ONLY WAY TO KNOW IS TO OPEN YOUR BIBLES AND READ IT YOURSELF. I was once blind but, now I see ! one day back in 1975 Almighty GOD “Yahweh” opened my eyes to see , that what I once thought and believed was “, which I was told that, we were in “THE ONLY TRUE CHURCH OF GOD .... was in fact a BIG DECEITFUL LIE! AGAIN PLEASE READ AND STUDY YOUR OWN BIBLES SO, YOU WILL KNOW THE TRUTH! Maybe you are in one of these kinds of churches right now? You may be told that you do not have to read the bible for yourself , because you will not understand it anyway so just follow along? Your ministers may be telling and teaching YOU the REAL TRUTH but how would you know if you have not read the bible or studied it to know they are or not teaching the truth? If you are in one of these kind of churches “GET OUT NOW, BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE”. Most of these kinds of churches teach from doctrines of Angles and men, most teach Religion and just use the bible enough to have you believe their booklets or some other books not of God? Do not be deceived by their ways as they just want you to follow them and they will deceive you from the true way of Gods Holy word ... your own bible !----pick it up and read it for yourself , see what it teaches! You will be surprised what it really teaches, but if you have an open mind and want to know what is true and what is religion then ! ASK THE LORD TO OPEN YOUR MIND TO KNOW HIS TRUTH! (Read and study my article “Let No man Deceive you” please use your bible to read it yourself!” (2 Peter 2:1-12 ) “ But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them–( there are so many people teaching that “Jesus was just a man or prophet of God and Not the son of the Living God, this is Anti-Christ!” ) if this is so, then the Lord knows how to rescue godly men from trials and to hold the unrighteous for the day of judgment, while continuing their punishment. This is especially true of those who follow the corrupt desire of the sinful nature and despise authority. Bold and arrogant, But these men blaspheme in matters they do not understand. They are like brute beasts, creatures of instinct, born only to be caught and destroyed, and like beasts they too will perish.” Yes people , we are living in the last time right now. (These words are paraphrased from the book of 1 Peter and may be read by going to your own bibles for better understanding.) “ I heard one women say at church that it was up to her minister to preach the truth after all she paid her tithe and came to church every week end and if she went to hell it wouldn’t be her fault it would be the ministers fault?”Is this women right? NO OF CORSE NOT! God gave us his Holy Word the Bible to read ourself to learn of his plan and then he sent his only begotten son Jesus to die for you and me so we can be saved! Amen how wonderful that is Grace and Salvation! How many of you think because you go to church and give money and sing songs that this will save you? I TELL YOU NOW “STUDY YOUR BIBLES FOR THE END IS NEAR.! I know you have heard from the time you can remember “ that the end is near “ and many MEN AND WOMEN have even set dates, fooling many! How ever , sooner or later, the end time will be upon us all! We all need to be prepared and ready for our last day. . Once again you do not have to believe what is written here but, I would ask you to at least read it with the scriptures provided then make up your own minds, do not be afraid of learning something your church does not preach because, they may not be using the bible to teach you in the first place? Ask Questions! Finally in closing dear friends, I wanted to encourage you to study the bible everyday as our time is short before our King of Kings will be arriving to share eternity with those who know his truth! (1 Peter 1:2-5) “ (We) who have been chosen according to the foreknowledge of Yahweh the Father, through the sanctifying work of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and sprinkling by his blood: Grace and peace be yours in abundance. Praise to Elohim for a Living Hope and eternal Grace given by him to all mankind. Praise be to the Yahweh the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade--kept in heaven for you, who through faith are shielded by Yahweh's power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time. If you live to be a hundred years old your time is still short, for one day each of us will stand before the Lord and have to give an answer for what we know and what we did with the word we heard! Amen! Your humble servant in the name of Jesus Christ Chaplain Jimmie Warren ©2018, Simple Salvation Church of God",1

"I am so happy and grateful to announce that I've been endorsed by the Democratic Veterans Caucus of Florida. Although I am not a veteran, my father was born on the island of Barbados, served for the British during WWII and then became a police officer before coming to the United States. Recently, I have been reminded of the importance of our democratic allies around the world and how we are stronger together. I am in awe that we now have a volunteer force that is willing to f ... ight for our freedoms every day, no matter the cost. I belong to the Hillsborough Democratic Veterans Caucus and it is my goal to continue to learn more and make progress on issues that benefit veterans. For starters, there should never be such a thing as a homeless or out of work veteran. We need to fight against privatization and make sure every veteran gets the benefits they deserve. Although my family immigrated here, I love this country and I feel 100 percent American.We can never forget the sacrifices that have been made by our armed services so each one of us can enjoy the rights and privileges we all enjoy as Americans.",1

"ANOTHER ENDORSEMENT! One of my opponents called the endorsements that I've been getting from tribes as 'special interest' groups. Not to sound too crass, but I believe every endorsement we all get, tribal or not, are 'special interests.' All endorsements are special to us and the groups that we speak to and in return want to help us get elected are special in their own right. The Jamestown S'klallam tribe is special to me and has joined the Lummi Nation, Nooksack tribal council and the 29 Palms Band of Mission Indians who are backing the same priorities I have to: 1. Make our schools safer 2. Create sustainable plans for the environment 3. Restorative Justice 4.

"I spend a lot of time listening to local elected officials talk about housing issues. And even among the best of them, there is usually hesitation and hedging about doing the right thing. Mitra is fearless. She wears her values on her sleeve. She says, 'I'm running to be a leader on housing issues for our city.' And it's so refreshingly clear that she means it. There are a lot of great candidates up and down the ballot in 2018. But lately, when people ask me which candidate ... I'm most excited about, I say Mitra Jalali Nelson. St. Paul needs a leader like Mitra. At a time when so many of our local problems -- from high rents to low wages to inadequate transportation -- are begging for collective and regional solutions, we all need more leaders like Mitra. -- Wedge LIVE",1

"“What Was Nike Thinking?” Maybe this: “If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now.” A week ago the President tweeted “What Was Nike Thinking?” It’s hard to say for certain, and certainly the 30th anniversary of their “Just do it” campaign was in the works for far longer than two months, but I’m guessing what they were think ... ing was a whole lot like our 4th of July email/FB post. And maybe a week ago they were more hoping than believing that just doing the right thing was the right thing to do. But this week, with their sales taking off and their stock more than recovered, I’m guessing they are now believing the same way we do. Below is a little shorter version of that email/post. If you know of anyone in marketing or running a business, or just looking for some hope for the future of our world, please forward this to them. It matters. July 3rd when I wrote this, I’m sure not every business leader was ready to give these ideas serious thought. Now, a little more than two months later, thanks to the courage of those at Nike, this is the new reality everyone that sells a product or service to people must do their best to understand. Once drive-thru windows were a novelty, then almost overnight no one in that industry could survive without them. Standing in support of your customers’ values in these times of unlimited political spending may be that same game changer. To wait idly by while your competitors figure this out is no longer an option. I think the words below can help you to understand how this works. And to all at Nike who made this happen, my hat is off to you. For us the risks are small; for you, huge. When the Penzey family gets out to visit our Beaverton Store, I would like to buy you all a beer. You are heroes. There is no more important struggle right now than the shift from profits through destroying our humanity to profits through defending our humanity. If we all succeed at this, all the rest of our problems will fall into place. Last week you moved the ball way down field to just where it needs to be. I thank you for your bravery. July 3, 2018 Please share this with those you know in business, marketing and with other humans as well. — We think we’ve discovered something. What we’ve discovered is that standing up against everything the Republican Party has become is really, really, really (+76 more reallys), really good for business. I understand how this can seem at odds with the image so popular right now that America is an evenly divided nation, but as we’ve learned this image does not reflect reality. And as much as it seems that the big issue right now is an out of control, possibly worse than racist presidency, that’s just the tip of the iceberg. The real issue is the unlimited political spending that brought this President and so many other Republicans to power. Watching tv ads and reading comment sections it can seem like Republicans actually have popular support, but these days ads and comments are simply part of the many things unlimited political spending can buy. Yet from our experience what we’ve found political spending can’t buy is popularity. This chart is our weekly online sales this year vs last year starting with the week of April 1st. It mostly is the tale of just two offers. The first was calling out the President for claiming that he was above the law; he isn’t, this is America where no one is above the law. No one can pardon themselves. The second came with us pointing out that the Russia probe has to happen because: Our President chose a campaign chairman who had accepted $17 Million from a pro-Russia political party. This chairman personally picked the Vice President, who in turn went on to pick a literal Russian agent as our country’s top national security advisor, despite being clearly warned by our intelligence community about his past. The first offer in the chart looks like two spikes because this is a weekly graph and that offer ran over a Saturday and Sunday. But that second offer, that big pyramid there, just ran for eighteen hours over a Thursday night. With that offer we received an eighty-fold increase in sales over the same time period last year. Along with the avalanche of orders we also got comments like: “Don’t mix business and politics, Bill. It’s bad for the bottom line.” “I was taught years ago, you don’t mix politics or religion with your business.” Yet look at the chart. This is not 80% growth, this is 80 times as much in sales! In our experience we’ve found that when you honestly support and speak out for the values of your customers, your customers support you. Looking at how we evolved, humanity really is the gift of Cooks, and for people who cook to simply watch as Republicans use the power the money of unlimited spending has bought them to undermine education, attack the environment, take health insurance from the poor, dehumanize those deemed not white enough, and separate children from their parents simply for seeking asylum, these can be heartbreaking times. Speaking out now really matters. If you are involved in a business that has been uncomfortable with the Republican attacks on human decency, there is really no better time to share those concerns with your customers than right now. Your country needs you to step up. And if you are a marketer, please be aware that the times are changing. Maybe it’s time to stop saying young people can’t be reached and instead try to get your clients to look to the values young people hold dear. At some point some breakfast cereal maker is going to celebrate the bravery of Colin Kaepernick by having him taking a knee on the cover of their box. In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55* for what I imagine might be another year or two. In that moment they will also win all of the younger generations for all of the rest of their lives. There’s talk right now about people no longer being interested in things but instead being interested in experiences. At Penzeys we sell Spices, the very things that have been selling continuously for longer than any other thing in human existence. I believe a big part of why Spices have the staying power they do is that they are experiences. Each Spice, every Seasoning connects us to a place, a time, an event that has at its heart our humanity — how we take care of each other. Make your product an experience, make your experience in some way radiate decency, compassion, and kindness and get ready to be busy. Right now those on the frontlines of challenging what the Republican Party has become are being rewarded, and that’s a good thing. Unlimited political spending has taken away the vote from individuals and given it to corporations that seek profit from undermining the public good. It’s time for Americans to vote with our spending. My advice is to be a company worth voting for. I believe what we’ve been experiencing is only the start of something much bigger. Business is an evolutionary process where the new things that work very quickly become what everyone needs simply to survive. This is not the time to be left behind. Spend every day like it’s November 6th. Bill Penzey bill@penzeys.com *I do regret the impact of this line: “In that moment they will lose a third of their customers over 55 for what I imagine might be another year or two.” I was trying to reach marketers and people responsible for making the numbers work for business, and in that world the 18-55 year-olds are the “coveted group.” And there is a reality to this. With wisdom the desire to spend money to impress strangers fades dramatically. That desire is pretty valuable to the marketing world. Yet as much as the 55+ crowd does not spend like sailors on shore leave, they are the ones who marched us out of Vietnam/Nixon, are responsible for so many of our environmental successes, and with the 1.27.17 Women’s March taught us how to march again. This age group does have a higher percentage of Republican Party supporters, and I tried not to lump everyone in this age group together by saying “a third,” but many still felt lumped. I am sorry. At some point I will figure out a way to showcase the heroes in this generation. So much of the goodness in our lives comes directly from them. **************** And Black Lives Matter. Racism is real in America and so much of where that racism is made real is through our justice system. To those creating the propaganda that taking a knee to bring awareness to this racism is an attack on Veterans and the flag—just stop already. As any Vietnam Veteran can tell you, through really painful stories, the well of support for those who serve in America is not limitless. Falsely creating the sense that speaking out against racism disrespects our troops may seem clever to those in charge of the current Republican Party agenda, but it’s a lie and it’s damaging the lives and reputations of those very troops it pretends to support. Falsely equating serving our country with the silent support of racism will have real costs. And once again, the brunt of these cost won’t be born by those doing the damage, but by those who have sacrificed so much to serve. Just stop already. Black lives really do matter. ****************** If you like what we are doing please “Like us” and share this, not just with business leaders, but with everyone who might find value in it.

"Today, Gold Star Father Khizr Khan was in town when the United States Supreme Court ruled, with the addition of Neil Gorsuch, to uphold President Trump’s Muslim ban. Our nation was founded on the principles of religious freedom and tolerance. Yet today’s ruling has lent legitimacy to the Islamophobia and scapegoating that was a hallmark of this President’s campaign, and which remains a central focus of his Administration. The United States has always been a nation of immigra ... nts – a beacon for those seeking refuge from war, tyranny, oppression, and instability. We’ve aspired to govern in the spirit of the words so many have read at the bottom of the Statue of Liberty, ""give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.” And we’ve all been made better for it. Immigrants of all backgrounds make invaluable contributions to our communities every day. Many have given their lives to defend this country, just as Captain Humayun Khan did. Today’s decision falls far below those ideals. It is unjust, and it will be remembered as a mark of shame on our nation’s history. But until then, it’s never been more important for us to fight for an America that respects the humanity we all share. We must continue to find power in our democracy, and the upcoming elections are our opportunity to do it.

"anotherHUMAN: Homelessness is emotionally overwhelming, for everyone. Regardless of the back&amp;forth of our conversations, regardless of how deeply you feel about the impact to our county, our city, our neighborhoods, our parks, our retail pockets and our families, we must keep one thing in mind: Underneath the impact being felt, nobody is being impacted more than the person experiencing homelessness, nobody. If you feel that the homeless are somehow choosing to be homeless please take a moment to come closer. Truth is, nobody chooses homelessness. Nobody chooses suffering over comfort, nobody chooses being cold over warmth, nobody chooses connection over separation. Each and every person experiencing homelessness has a profound and very personal reason for 'the why' of their journey. Regardless of your view of homelessness, do yourself a favor and take one step closer to a person experiencing the struggle of homelessness, with non-judgment and an open heart take the time to just learn this person's truth. This is Aaron, he's 27 years old, born in Seattle, graduated from West Seattle High School with a 3.9 GPA, was on the Cheer Squad.

Aaron feels worn down by folks yelling horrible things at him for being homeless. Underneath all of the back&amp;forth conversations on the issue of homelessness, there remains a solid truth.

"It's a sad day in politics when the most important thing to some folks is holding on to a seat by any means, including baseless and unsubstantiated attacks, not about policies or issues, but distortions of reality, meant to distract voters from the real needs of the district. It's not about me, the Senate seat, or winning by any means, it's about listening to SD20 residents and making sure their needs are the priority. My family and their well-being is also important to me, ... which is why I care so much about making sure all Oregonians have access to affordable healthcare, and Oregonians do not have to decide between taking care of a loved one or making rent. Family comes first. Since family matters so much, my brother, Curtis, wrote and submitted the following letter to a number of Pamplin papers recently... ""My name is Curtis Gallia and I’d like to set the record straight. Nearly 20 years ago, my brother, Charles Gallia — currently running for Senate District 20 — and I changed our last name from Stoudt to Gallia. Charles and I disagree on a lot of things, including our political views. He’s a Democrat and I’m a proud Tea Party supporter. But despite our differences, some things we share are honesty and integrity. So it burns me that anyone would question Charles’ honesty, especially when it comes to our family’s good name. I was born three months after our father, Clarence, was killed by a drunk driver. Left to raise us by herself, our Mom did the best she could, and eventually remarried. Her husband adopted me, my sister, and Charles, and we all became Stoudt’s. Many years later, after our Mom and stepdad divorced, our paternal grandmother, Elizabeth, lay dying in the hospital. As Charles and I sat by her bedside, she held one of each of our hands in hers. And squeezing her hands tightly around ours, she looked up at us and asked that we change our name back to Gallia. We both, of course, agreed. And we did fulfill our promise. We even went together to the courthouse to file the paperwork. So, it’s offensive to me, to my family, and to the integrity of the Gallia name that Senator Olsen’s team would assert that my brother would change his name for any other reason than to fulfill the dying wish of our grandmother. I stay out of politics, but they went too far. Nothing is more important than family. One thing Charles and I can agree on."" ~Curtis Gallia And below is a picture of me and my sister, Charlene, on our fire truck, for your enjoyment. Thank you for your support!",1

They are not as conniving and as calculating as most other people. They call it as they see it ! Some take this as a weakness but I now know this is a strength. It is time to make people feel good about themselves and this country. We have been bashing each other and the country for too long. It is time to come together, unite and inspire one another with good deeds and the benevolence that our country affords us all. Be a democrat or a Republican, be whatever you want, but first and foremost be an American. Be a friend.

"I wasn’t sure about writing a book on addiction. Especially my addiction. ⁣ But then I read a study that completely changed my mind. It shows just how important it is that we all change how we talk about addiction and how we view those struggling with addiction. ⁣ ⁣ Two researchers, Leake and King, went to three different alcohol recovery centers and started analyzing the files and data on the patients there. ⁣ ... ⁣ At the end of their time, they told the staff at these centers which clients they believed were most likely to recover. ⁣ ⁣ The researchers then tracked the progress of everyone leaving the center. ⁣ ⁣ A year later, the individuals they identified were still more likely than the rest to be employed and sober and to have had fewer and shorter relapses. ⁣ ⁣ What had the researchers observed that allowed them to so accurately predict success? ⁣ ⁣ Nothing. ⁣ ⁣ Leake and King randomly assigned people to be on the list of those with a high chance of recovery. ⁣ ⁣ They didn’t tell the patients, only the staff. ⁣ ⁣ What changed is that the staff were more likely to believe that someone could recover. When the beliefs of the staff changed, so did the outcomes. ⁣ ⁣ It doesn’t end there. ⁣ ⁣ Another study showed that just the tone of voice a doctor uses, judgmental vs. empathetic, can change the likelihood of someone recovering. ⁣ ⁣ Small changes can have an outsized impact. ⁣ ⁣ I truly believe that:⁣ ⁣ If we change what we believe about those who are addicted, we can curb the tide of the overdose epidemic. ⁣ ⁣ So yes, I hope you check out the book.

I’ll tackle consolidation in the agriculture and farming sector head-on and break the stranglehold a handful of companies have over the market. That’s how we build an economy that works for everyone.

"We need your help TODAY, please. As you know, two weeks ago, Tiffany Cabán was elected the new District Attorney of Queens, New York. Last night, during a counting of absentee ballots and affidavit ballots, nearly 2,000 actual votes for Tiffany were thrown out on various technicalities - suddenly giving her opponent, Melinda Katz, a lead of just 20 votes. It’s an awful reality of our democracy that we all work hard to encourage people to vote, then when they do, their vote ge ... ts thrown out on random technicalities.

"For Love and Humanity: Flat-out Free $24.49 New Hope Box! Plus Free Justice offer combines for a $40+ value with just $5 purchase — Four years ago today, 7-6-15, our President rolled out his campaign including the words: ""Likewise, tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border."" No one with any sense of history has any doubts about who he was channeling. Four years ago many hoped this was not who he really was, but just a cynical ploy to stand out in a crowded f ... ield. But if there were any doubts or feelings this was just an act, on this the fourth anniversary of his launching his campaign with such cruel, calculated words, that doubt has long vanished. Each day as we learn more from the camps where asylum seekers are being separated from their children and concentrated in unhealthy living conditions, the toll of his dehumanizing of others becomes more clear. That so many Republicans have simply embraced the motto of the first lady’s “I really don’t care” jacket is actually kind of heartbreaking. Two years ago we did a giveaway on this anniversary to bring attention to his Nazi-style dehumanization of others just trying to find some way to bring attention to just how much more dangerous this president is to America, and the offer was well received. Yes, at least from the time of Nixon on, there’s been a pretty open embrace of racism by the Republican Party, but as truly horrible as racism is, what this president is doing is something much worse. To believe yourself better than others because of race is rotten to the core, but to arrive at the point where you no longer see others as even human is where things go frighteningly wrong. History shows again and again that unless we find a way to block the path the Republicans are now on or turn them to another direction, a whole lot of good, decent, innocent people are going to end up losing their lives. We can quibble about do we now have actual concentration camps in America. What is clear is that many-many republican voters are looking at camps where humans are facing intentionally-created suffering and seeing no real problem with it. If they are not objecting now, will they object to the next step, or the step after that? Hopefully we never find out. A big part of what makes Cooks so valuable is their ability to find the silver lining in every cloud. Those up to no good know the value in hopelessness. Over the years I’ve come to believe that what makes Cooks so valuable is that, no matter the message those up to no good are spreading, Cooks simply refuse to abandon all hope no matter what. Cooks Embrace Hope, always have, always will. And when times reach their worst, that hope makes all the difference. But I have to admit, for the last couple of years, for these July 6th offers I’ve had a hard time creating the sense of hope that, if we are going to live up to our Voice Of Cooking trademark, we always need to be able to find. This year is different. This year, finally, there actually is New Hope. Though you don’t see it brought up much these past few months, the 11.6.18 election changed everything. That was a good night. In the vote totals we all found the proof we so needed that real America is still very much alive. In the overwhelming rejection of republicans across the board, including twelve million more votes for Democratic Senate candidates than Republican ones, the true story of America was shouted from the rooftops for all to hear. The only reason this administration still holds the White House is because of the length of time between presidential elections. America doesn’t want him. And of course there is no reason to trust this president and his republican supporters in Congress. And there is every reason to fear the hurt he will inflict in the time he has left, so we must all work to minimize that hurt. Still, come the night of 11.3.20 one of League of Extraordinary Candidates the Democratic Party is now fielding will take back the White House for the people of this nation. As long as we don’t lose hope, as long as we get everyone we know to vote, and as long as we stand together against the inhumanity that has captured the Republican Party, the reality is, the future is already certain. Let’s all do all we can to keep hope alive! At Penzeys we’ve found that a good message travels far, but a good message combined with a great offer with your sharing has no limits to its reach. So for two days, through Sunday night 7.7.19, we are doing our best to shine a spotlight on the dangers of supporting this president while celebrating the decency and goodness of those his administration and the Republican Party seek to dehumanize with not one, but two great offers. The first is a flat-out free in our stores $24.49 value New Hope box. Online at To see all the goodness of the New Hope Box please click this link: The second great offer is the $15.90 value brand new Penzeys Justice Seasoning and limited time Justice poster for free with any $5 purchase.

"Thank you for all the support shown on my last post. I had one person post that showed me how little he understands the liquor industry. He repeatedly showed me how little he understands it. lol. For a liquor store to survive the current changes and the ones that are coming we have to maintain or grow. The companies liquor stores buy from are monopolies to start with. In Kansas, no two companies can carry the same product. In Kansas, there are 2 main companies that liqu ... or stores buy wine and spirits from. We also have a Coors Dist. and a Budweiser Dist. Everyone of these companies has bowed down to Walmart. By bowed down, I mean Walmart literally does nothing. The trucks are told when they'll be there or the order will be refused. The drivers of the truck take the product in and literally stock the shelves out on the floor and check out lanes. No, beer is not kept on check out lanes. Beer companies sell certain energy drinks that are and the truck driver has to stock all those little coolers. Walmart will not restock their own shelves so the companies they've bought the product from have hired extra people to go running to them when their shelves need restocked. All of the ass kissing shown to Walmart has never been offered to liquor stores nor do the majority of us want that service. There is a liquor store in Wichita who does get that attention. Groves Liquor continually demands and gets anything they want. Why you ask. Because he has alot of money and the people who run the companies we all buy from have absolutely no backbone and bow down to him simply because they don't want to deal with his awful disposition. He threatens and he gets what he wants. He is reported to ABC continually and sometimes they fine him and he laughs in their face and pay the fines. His employees dont have to do much either. The companies also send people in to do all the real work just as they do for Walmart. He saves a ton of money because he doesn't have to pay the people who do all the work in his store. It is just given to him. The employees that are sent there are not treated with any respect or appreciation. Sometimes ABC does nothing. But they wont shut him down because they make so much on his fines. The liquor industry is not an easy industry to survive in. Its getting harder and when Walmart puts enough money in the lobbyists pockets they will get wine and spirits making it even harder. If you have enough money and put it in the right pockets you will dictate what happens. Money is what makes this world go around. I am not looking for sympathy. I'm not afraid of hard work. I just want you to understand what us smaller liquor stores are up against. I work all day everyday in my store. I draw a paycheck and trust me, it's not a big one. I have not and will never make alot of money in this industry. I always try to make good decisions and offer my customers the best prices I can. You could ask any employee of mine what I tell them is of most importance to me and it is my customers. They are told that being friendly and helpful to every customer is the one thing I insist on. I'm sorry this post went on so long. I really just wanted to say thank you again for your business. I promise you, I appreciate all of you.",1

"There's No Reason Today To Not Neuter or Spay This Mama kitty is approximately 7 months old. And boy has she suffered. Shamrock was tagged at 3:00 A.M.Folks claimed she was a stray but her sweet and friendly demeanor indicated she had been owned. Short of knocking on doors Mama Kitty went from neighbor to neighbor quietly mewing for help and grateful for even a kibble. When the neighbors noted a liquid infection and foul smell we were contacted. As soon as the vet's office o ... pened, schedules were changed and caring veterinarians rushed in to save her life. Some of the kittens didn't make it. They couldn't sustain without the care and nourishment this Mother had not received. Over $500.00 later and a Mom who would have clearly died had Shamrock not intervened our first response was pure gratitude. But then we all talked. With veterinarians who spay and neuter routinely, and several organizations such as ours who spend an astronomical amount of money to help low-income, elderly, disabled folks, Good Samaritans to offset the costs with vouchers why do we still face an extreme over-population problem? Our shelters are overwhelmed; Cats and Kittens are dying alone and on the streets and even in homes. And this one simple thing we can all do, SPAY AND NEUTER can change the destiny and save a life today. But think about it. If one un-spayed female and her offspring can produce 420,000 kittens over a 7 year span when YOU make the choice to spay or neuter your cat - YOU JUST DID SOMETHING VERY VERY SPECIAL! YOU ALONE JUST SAVED THOUSANDS OF LIVES AND YOU PREVENTED THOUSANDS OF DEATHS! THAT IS PRETTY POWERFUL! And YOU should feel very proud! A special Thank you to our amazing foster Samantha.

"Here is an article I have been holding onto until after this hearing today, because I wanted to see how it went before I made the post. I agree 100% with Amash! HERE IS HOW ITS GOING TO GO DOWN FOLKS! A reader and I just had a chat, whats going on is the Democrats are paralyzed by fear! Now if you have been with me for awhile, you know how I feel about this, so sorry for being repetitive. If you are new, let me summarize. For the duration of my time on this blog, I had been totally AGAINST IMPEACHMENT. My members and I had discussed multiple reasons why that would probably be a bad idea. For example, we discussed the issue of having Pence as our President being worse than Trump himself. We talked about the idea being widely unpopular. We talked about the repercussions Republicans faced as a results of the failed Clinton impeachments, and how Republicans faced heavy losses in the 90s. These are just a few. However, over the course of the last six months, I have noticed myself, and many readers, having a shift in how we view the impeachment idea. I find for myself, I have 100% totally shifted my views, and I say just do it! My reasons for this are vast, however, the largest reason for this includes: - Pence wouldn't be as horrific as President as he would prior to Democrats taking over the House after the midterms as he would have had Republicans had total control of government, and Republicans actually had been able to get things accomplished without a child in charge. So, let me just say how it is. Trump is MOST LIKELY GOING TO WIN AGAIN IN 2020. YES YOU ARE READING THIS CORRECTLY. Tump will likely win! I am just saying how it is guys. The fact of the matter is that Democrats just cant get their act together (but really a four letter word starting with an ""s"") plus, nobody has been able to figure out how to successfully campaign against Trump. He is an anomaly. He just has unfortunately brought out the worst in people. That being said. Democrats are sitting around, waiting for some ah-ha moment to start impeachment hearings, and the moment isn't going to happen. So here is my point. I WOULD RATHER HAVE THE DEMOCRATS TAKE THE RISK, AND START THE IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS, AT LEAST AS A WAY TO START GETTING THE INFORMATION OUT THERE. Also, there is a strategic reason for it. Democrats won't have to keep filing all these subpoena's to get information. Per impeachment laws, if the Democrats start OFFICIAL IMPEACHMENT HEARINGS, THEY ARE LEGALLY DUE ANY INFORMATION THEY ARE TRYING TO GET, MINUS THE COURT SYSTEM, MINUS MORE INVESTIGATIONS, PER WHAT WOULD BE KNOWN AS THE ""DISCOVERY PROCESS"". Even if the preceding fails, they AT LEAST took the risk. Here is why folks! I WOULD RATHER HAVE DEMOCRATS LOSE IN 2020 HAVING TAKEN THE RISK, rather then having them have LOST, having done NOTHING! If we look at history, Nixon was popular, and even won in re-election, until people found out information via his impeachment hearings. Thats when he was forced to resign. If Democrats sit and do nothing, after having largely being elected because the public voted for them because they WANTED THIS PRESIDENT TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE, and they do nothing, and lose, its their own fault, and I am NOT GOING TO DEFEND THEM, AND GO ON BEING CALLED A ""libtard"" for another 4 years! MOREOVER- Democrats might actually have a chance at winning IF THEY TAKE THE CHANCE, because THEY COULD THEN HAVE A CASE TO MAKE TO AMERICANS that THEY WERE IN FACT THE ONES THAT TRIED TO DO THE RIGHT THINGS, while Republicans protected the President. THIS IS EXACTLY HOW THEY WON THE MIDTERMS!! Look. Impeachment is not supposed to be a widely popular and a pleasant process. It's supposed to, for a lack of a better word, suck. its supposed to be drastic, and meant for the worst case. If not now, WHEN??? Can we all just collectively grow a pair?",1
"My name is Steve Silberman and I am an American citizen - nothing more, but nothing less. I am just like you. As a boy in Alabama, I was taught early on that it is my duty as a citizen to speak out should anything or anyone put this country in jeopardy. When I was a young man, I took an oath to support and defend the Constitution. So it is with rising alarm that now, as a grown man and for the record, I write with full conviction that I believe that the United States is in g ... reat and immediate danger. A danger of a type we have never experienced before as a country. We have allowed a damaged and unstable person to become the President of the United States. It is written that the Presidency will reveal a man’s character. Whatever kind of person one was before public life is amplified exponentially, and so is the potential to do good or, to do bad. Think about who the President was as a “civilian”. Think about the bad faith dealings and the petty and unnecessary meanness. Think about the vindictiveness and the bullying and the eager willingness to ruin anyone who didn’t please him (or let him win). Think about the women. He now demonstrates, almost on a daily basis, that he is true to his nature still. He is a man with insecurities so debilitating that he cultivates the constant reassurances of his enablers, be they his beholden underlings or the lemmings in the crowd. He remains that same childish person - only now with his own army (both literally and politically) and my children’s future in his hands. We are constitutionally at the mercy of man who believes, that if he says something, it must be true. A man with flaws so profound that our national peace of mind is being taken from us. We cannot know on any day that critical decisions are being made in good faith on the people’s behalf. My greatest fear now is that If he’s having a bad day, and his stress is too high, and the right set of circumstances are presented, ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN. So, please, if you are worried as I am, speak out and speak soon. If you have a voice, raise it. If you have an arm, wave it. If you have a pen, let it be known that you too are sounding the alarm. Shout it from the rafters that the crisis is here and it is now. Make people listen. Make people think. Make the Congress understand that they each will ultimately be judged by how they respond in this time of urgent national risk. So, now it is in the cloud for my descendants to see, that I was not willing to watch my country be changed to suit the purposes of just one man. No one in a democracy is supposed to be that special. If we don’t stop this slow-motion disaster soon, our country may have already seen it’s best days. There will be a reckoning - a penalty that we all must pay for allowing such a person to run our country. And the longer this goes on, the worse it will be. Tremendous damage is already being done. Please consider the sacrifice of those who have died to protect our way of life and DO SOMETHING. Be a citizen. It's your duty. Everything we hold dear is on the line. What will your great grandchildren have to say about you?",1

"Dark Times As our country inches closer towards authoritarianism every day with our government scapegoating and vilifying the least of these in the eyes of Jesus, ripping immigrant children from their mothers and putting them in cages where their screaming can be heard outside, with our President and Republican Senators targeting elected congressional representatives of color calling them “the four horsewomen of the apocalypse” and telling them to “go back to the places from ... which they came,” to we find ourselves in dark, evil times led by liars who praise murderous dictators and castigate our allies. We watch horrified as the majority of “Christians” in the US, 81% of white evangelicals, not only support the atrocities taking place, the environment being destroyed, health insurance being ripped away from those who can’t afford it, rampant corruption and profit taking from the President and his family, trade policies being put in place that are well-known to crash the economy, unnecessary walls being built, Supreme court rulings that erode the rights of women, massive tax cuts to corporations and billionaires while wages have remained stagnant for decades, corporations taking their tax cuts, closing their manufacturing plants, and buying back stock, these “Christians” will shout you down for even questioning what they support. They have abandoned Jesus. They know nothing of Jesus and his ways, of the things he taught. Yet they tell us we worship an imaginary God and we aren’t Christians. Everything is upside down. There are very few places left where Christians who have NOT forgotten about Jesus’ instructions can gather, discuss the events of the day, support one another and welcome allies who see what is happening as well.

Thanksgiving isn’t just a day for Cooks because it involves moving food into and out of the oven. Thanksgiving is a day for Cooks because it both radiates and needs all the kindness and compassion that are at the heart of cooking. Two years from now will be the 400th anniversary of that first truly American Thanksgiving that European sett ... lers ever experienced, but it was by no means the first American Thanksgiving. We all need to be very careful when generalizing anything about our Native American community. It’s a very real possibility that there is more diversity within the Native American community than in all the other cultures here in this country combined. Still, a theme that runs through so much of what was here before Europeans ever arrived was this notion of giving thanks, and not just for one day a year but constantly. That we get to participate in the continuation of this tradition is honestly pretty awesome. But this awesomeness needs to be tempered with the reality of the horrors the arrival of the Europeans set in motion. With so little attention and even less honesty given to the atrocities that were committed against America’s Native community, there’s no way this one day where we actually pay attention to their story can’t also demand protest and sadness. For ordinary people this combination of polar opposite emotions, while also trying to place far more good food on the table than any other day of the year, can be overwhelming. But for Cooks, this is where we shine. Some day, my hope is that Thanksgiving will be a day all Americans come together in the knowledge that what actually makes America great is not to be found in what the Europeans brought with them, but instead in what was flourishing here already when they arrived. It’s time we all understand that America was not born on July 4, 1776; that was simply us declaring our independence from Britain. Instead, the idea of America was born, at least in the minds of Europeans, over the summer of 1621 in the kindness of Tisquantum and the Wampanoag people. Theirs was a humanity for the ages. But before we get on to the better Thanksgivings of the future we must first take on the racism towards Native Americans that has never ended. For me, I think the place to start is with stopping the association of Native American imagery with sports. There’s no way around the horrors that started with a plague ultimately turned into a holocaust. Holocausts can’t be committed behind closed doors, they have to be committed in the open, and because of this, with every holocaust there needs to be a lie crafted and then continually repeated to claim justification for the atrocity. For the holocaust against our Native community the lie was that they were too wild, too savage, too uncivilized to live at peace with others. This lie has never been honestly addressed and still continues on to this day with sports naming that places Native Americans alongside the Lions and Tigers and Bears that are meant to invoke the image of fear and uncontrolled violence. This lie has to end. It hurts children, all children no matter what their background. Please do what you can to speak out on this to those that will listen and even more importantly to those that won’t. As a Cook you not only have the skills to promote humanity, you have the strength to speak out against inhumanity. Your strength is something everyone you know is thankful for whether they have the strength to admit that or not. You matter to those around you. You are admired by those around you. 398 years ago a meal happened that was so good and so right that we have relived it every year since. Let’s all do what we can to make a day worthy of that spirit. Love people, cook them tasty food. It’s not that difficult. Thanks for having the spirit of a Cook, Bill bill@penzeys.com And as promised here are some recipes: Satisfying Seasoned Nuts:",1

Puffy Paws cares for kitties with feline leukemia, FIV, feral cats, unadoptable kitties, one eyed cats, senior kitties, kitties that do not use their litter box, cats with neurological disorders, abused kitties and more - basically unwanted and unadoptable kitties that would be euthanized elsewhere.

"Attention Greenville, Simpsonville, Mauldin, FiveForks.... and all surrounding areas: I just wanted to let everyone know that Quality Performance is up and running! We are ready and able to help folks all over the upstate during this unpredictable and scary time. I have decided to implement a few changes in the way I normally do things under the unprecedented circumstances from the COV-19 outbreak. I understand that in these times, we all have to make the right priority ... decisions as well as financial decisions. I have decided to offer a 3 month payment option for services up to $600 and 6 a month option for jobs greater than $600 if needed. Maybe to some this seems to not be a big deal but there are a lot of people that have a home and outside sitting areas that really need cleaning and are afraid to spend money not know what’s ahead. I watch the news just like everyone else does and it seems to be headed in the direction that we may all be staying home a lot more with our families. With all of the rain we’ve had this year, it has caused an abundance of mold and algae to grow on porches and patios where we will likely spend most of our time. The last thing you want is for your allergies to really kick up during this crazy time. Also I would like to offer any County or City owned parks, daycare/nursery’s that have a playground that they would like to be cleaned and sanitized, to please contact me and I will make time to come out and clean at NO CHARGE! I have the availability of sanitizing chemicals as well as hot water which really helps the sanitizing process. Anything I can do to help our local community and neighbors, I am willing to do. I have been very blessed in my life with a lot of great things and people around me so I feel like it’s my turn to help others if I can. Thank you all and please all be safe and listen to our government officials and take precautions to stay safe.",1

Fortunately for them, our chimpanzees are unaware of the concern and uncertainty we all face. We are fortunate in that we purchase all of our fresh fruits and vegetables from the local villages, but five cases of the virus already have been diagnosed in Cameroon. As of March 13th, the country has effectively shut its borders, and supply chain interruptions are already affecting our access to essential medical and camp supplies. Our scheduled volunteers, including a veterinarian who was to travel with much-needed medical supplies this week, have had to cancel. We don’t yet know if the virus affects chimpanzees. While we strongly support containment efforts around the globe, we are also gravely concerned about the effect of border restrictions on the sanctuary and the 76 rescued chimpanzees in our care. And we remain very aware that chimps, gorillas and other endangered wildlife living in the forest around our sanctuary will only survive if we honor our pledge to protect them. Despite worldwide circumstances, our critical conservation work must continue! We are asking for your help in this dire, life-changing time. Since our annual fundraising event in NYC has been postponed, we are counting on you. Any and all donation amounts will help tremendously! Whether you can give $25 or $2,500, we will greatly appreciate it! Please donate today! We will certainly keep you updated on our chimpanzees, staff and local Cameroon news during this calamitous time.

"My Wife RWJ and I talked about this very thing at breakfast this morning. The Emory University Hospital Statement confirmed what I have know for several weeks, hopefully it will clear things up for those of you that don’t understand what the fuss and worry is all about. We have been fortunate here in Anderson, South Carolina but things are going to get much worse here and if we don’t get serious and change our thoughts and actions in a big way we are going to be at a very v ... ery very bad place. I think we all need to DO THE RIGHT THINGS, FOR THE RIGHT REASONS AT THE RIGHT TIME, everyday and especially now and Into the future. CONTINUE SOCIAL DISTANCING BECAUSE IT DOES SLOW THE SPREAD OF COVID 19 ! (RIGHT THINGS)Think of yourself as a COVID 19 carrier and act in the best interest of yourself and others. Think of everyone you come in contact with as a COVID 19 carrier to protect yourself and others. Treat every surface that you touch as being infected by the Coronavirus so as to protect yourself and others. Help others in need because it is always the right thing to do. (RIGHT REASONS) Take care of yourself and others because we all need to be responsible in any emergency especially this deadly pandemic. COVID 19 has no vaccine nor cure and it is highly contagious and spreads exponentially. This disease is a train wreck waiting to happen. if we all don’t do our part to stop the progression NOW we will be heartbroken and that is a stark reality. (RIGHT TIME) We cannot worry about what we and others did not do in the past we have to look to “RIGHT NOW” and into the “FUTURE”. NOW IS THE RIGHT TIME TO DO WHAT WE ARE TOLD TO DO BY THE SCIENTIST, PHYSICIANS &amp; OUR LEADERS. Another thing that we need to do “RIGHT NOW” is to PRAY FOR THE WHOLE WORLD my Main Street Program, Anderson, SC | Facebook Friends. Be safe for yourself and for all others that you come in contact with because it is the most important thing in the world for the health and safety of us all. From an Emory epidemiologist who shared the following: 'As an infectious disease epidemiologist, at this point I feel morally obligated to provide some information on what we are seeing from a transmission dynamic perspective and how they apply to the social distancing measures. Specifically, I want to make two aspects of these measures very clear and unambiguous. First, we are in the very infancy of this epidemic’s trajectory. That means even with these measures we will see cases and deaths continue to rise globally, nationally, and in our own communities in the coming weeks. Our hospitals will be overwhelmed, and people will die that didn’t have to. This may lead some people to think that the social distancing measures are not working. They are. They may feel futile. They aren’t. You will feel discouraged. You should. This is normal in chaos. This enemy that we are facing is very good at what it does; we are not failing. We need everyone to hold the line as the epidemic inevitably gets worse. This is not my opinion; this is the unforgiving math of epidemics for which I and my colleagues have dedicated our lives to understanding with great nuance, and this disease is no exception. We know what will happen; I want to help the community brace for this impact. Stay strong and with solidarity knowing with absolute certainty that what you are doing is saving lives, even as people begin getting sick and dying around you. You may feel like giving in. Don’t. Second, although social distancing measures have been (at least temporarily) well-received, there is an obvious-but-overlooked phenomenon when considering groups (i.e. families) in transmission dynamics. While social distancing decreases contact with members of society, it of course increases your contacts with group (i.e. family) members. This small and obvious fact has surprisingly profound implications on disease transmission dynamics. Study after study demonstrates that even if there is only a little bit of connection between groups (i.e. social dinners, playdates/playgrounds, etc.), the epidemic trajectory isn’t much different than if there was no measure in place. The same underlying fundamentals of disease transmission apply, and the result is that the community is left with all of the social and economic disruption but very little public health benefit. You should perceive your entire family to function as a single individual unit; if one person puts themselves at risk, everyone in the unit is at risk. Seemingly small social chains get large and complex with alarming speed. If your son visits his girlfriend, and you later sneak over for coffee with a neighbor, your neighbor is now connected to the infected office worker that your son’s girlfriend’s mother shook hands with. This sounds silly, it’s not. This is not a joke or a hypothetical. We as epidemiologists see it borne out in the data time and time again and no one listens. Conversely, any break in that chain breaks disease transmission along that chain. In contrast to hand-washing and other personal measures, social distancing measures are not about individuals, they are about societies working in unison. These measures also take a long time to see the results. It is hard (even for me) to conceptualize how ‘one quick little get together’ can undermine the entire framework of a public health intervention, but it does. I promise you it does. I promise. I promise. I promise. You can’t cheat it. People are already itching to cheat on the social distancing precautions just a “little”- a playdate, a haircut, or picking up a needless item at the store, etc. From a transmission dynamics standpoint, this very quickly recreates a highly connected social network that undermines all of the work the community has done so far. Until we get a viable vaccine this unprecedented outbreak will not be overcome in grand, sweeping gesture, rather only by the collection of individual choices our community makes in the coming months. This virus is unforgiving to unwise choices. My goal in writing this is to prevent communities from getting ‘sucker-punched’ by what the epidemiological community knows will happen in the coming weeks. It will be easy to be drawn to the idea that what we are doing isn’t working and become paralyzed by fear, or to ‘cheat’ a little bit in the coming weeks. By knowing what to expect, and knowing the importance of maintaining these measures, my hope is to encourage continued community spirit, strategizing, and action to persevere in this time of uncertainty. # holdtheline # community # flattenthecurve ' "" Thanks for sharing Augusta Dunse Emory University Healthcare",1

"“I kept seeing the adverts for OYNB pop up day in and day out. I had been having a niggly feeling in the back of my mind that maybe I should give this a shot. I eventually took the plunge and decided I had nothing to lose. After an incredibly difficult year personally, I relied on alcohol to take the edge off. By no means was I an alcoholic, but I was, what I thought, a more tolerable and funnier person with it. It allowed me to get out of my comfort zone and to live in a wo ... rld where I didn’t necessarily have to deal with what was going on. I can’t say that there was one trigger, but there was always a reason when I was on my own for a few days, to enjoy a few glasses of wine or a night out that ended in becoming an entire night and morning event. Whilst I am thankful, I was never in a position of being out of control, I could see that if I didn’t reign it in, that I would have gotten to that point. The consideration of this challenge was made for the wellbeing of my little family, for myself and for my race season that was coming up. As a triathlete and runner, this was where I let off steam and I wasn’t going to allow alcohol to stop that from happening. Taking the challenge, I thought honestly was going to be a walk in the park. I had planned to sign up for 28 days in my head but when registering, somehow, I chose 90 days. I expected it to be a smooth transition to controlling my intake and I kept my family and races in mind. These were my reasons why. I wanted to be the mum I have always been and to continue to be present for my children and not be the short tempered one I had been for a short period of time in the year, I didn’t want them to see me with a glass of wine in my hand, I wanted to be able to train and not be tired or hungover, or unprepared. I never thought I suffered from anxiety before drinking, nor did I really think I slept badly, but I realise now that neither were true. I have realised that I am now funnier and more in control of my surroundings and situations than I have ever been. I have built and repaired relationships with those around me, within myself and allowed a better version of me to come out for those in the future. I love the time I spend with my children; I have energy for days when I am with them and we have the most fun. I am also incredibly confident, I wake up excited to start my day and to see what adventures lies ahead, for 2 reasons. I will be able to make the best of them and I will be able to remember them. My energy levels are through the roof, I have done a triathlon where I reached a personal best as well as my first half marathon of 21kms. Admittedly both without training, but the possibilities are endless if I put as much focus into that as I do into not drinking. Choosing to get out, live and to really experience is easier when I am not plagued with the possibilities of what could go wrong or trying to control a situation, being AF has honestly set me free. What I’ve learnt from my challenge so far is that I am the only one that can stop me living the truest version of myself. Since starting my challenge, I have lost 7kg’s, my skin is radiant, and I cannot stop smiling! The anxiety I didn’t think I had, turns out I did, and is no longer there. I have mental clarity and a vision for my life, one without alcohol and if I could shake someone that is, or was as lost as I was, that they can do it, I would, I am living and breathing and loving this life and I can’t see how I would ever trade it in for my old one. I am so proud to tell people that I am part of this challenge, not because it feels like work, because it doesn’t. No one is standing behind you telling you to be better, as a community we all stand hand in hand and move with each other and shout for those ahead and pick those up who have stumbled along the way. I absolutely love the sense of community, we actually have our own little South African group chat which is an amazing group of diverse people, within the country, all uniting together to support each other and to make sure that everyone sees the sunshine in our achievements and motivate us when we are sitting staring at our alcohol cabinets. Like our little group, the OYNB Challengers Facebook group has an amazing following, with some of the most powerful stories and some that hit home harder than I would have imagined, but somehow we are all there, anytime we need each other, there is never a moment where we aren’t able to reach out. That is the difference between doing it on your own and allowing others to join you on your journey. Not only are we inspired daily, but we are placed in a position to inspire others.” - Tamryn-Leigh If you want to join Tamryn-Leigh in taking that first step to transforming your relationship with alcohol and watch your entire life transform around you, you can apply to join our exclusive 28, 90 or 365 Day Challenges.

"the three things that now need to happen if the transformation of farnham is town centre is finally to take off my column in this week is herald
last week's news that a farnham project board has been set up to oversee recommendations for a multimillion pound transformation of the town may strike some sceptics as yet another bureaucratic exercise or talking shop but as someone who has campaigned for many years on issues such as pollution in the town centre pedestrianisation and a wrecclesham relief road i am genuinely optimistic that things will be different this time
i speak as someone who has had their fair share of setbacks after hitting a brick wall six years ago i assembled a group of people to fund a referendum to find out what the town actually thought we won it but by just 51 the narrowness of the margin reflected concerns about practicalities rather than principle which had widespread support
why am i more optimistic this time firstly because we have the wholehearted support of tim oliver the leader of surrey county council who has thrown his weight behind transforming one of only a few major towns in surrey that still routes traffic right through its centre i have learned the hard way that nothing will ever happen if we don't have the support of our three councils so the enthusiastic support of john ward leader of waverley and john neale leader of farnham town council is also extremely welcome the fact that between us we are from different political parties is also important because it makes it more likely we can achieve a broad consensus in the town for the same reason it is particularly encouraging that the town's three county councillors wyatt ramsdale stephen spence and andy mcleod are all working closely together to take things forward
three things now need to happen to make what has too often felt like an impossible dream actually come true
firstly the project board whilst it rightly comprises of the town's political leadership does not itself represent the broad crossspectrum of opinion in the town andy mcleod and john neale have therefore taken responsibility for making sure we listen to the many diverse voices in the town from established organisations such as the farnham society and the chamber of commerce to the voices of those with families young people pensioners cyclists and commuters we must make sure everyone is listened to carefully before any decisions are made
secondly we are all going to need to compromise if we are to be successful i have often joked that farnham is the only town in the country with 35000 traffic engineers but we are actually lucky to have a wealth of specialist knowledge in our midst we all have our own priorities usually relating to where we live and how we use the town but whether we opt for full pedestrianisation or 'shared spaces' parttime or full time closure of roads the borough or a wider footprint are all decisions which will require compromises between competing priorities
we also need to be honest that if we make any changes to traffic patterns there will disruption not least for those driving cars many of whom will continue to need to drive the hope is that any changes will settle down over time as people get used to them and adjust habits not least in the context of the big changes that are happening anyway with brightwells but it will take time for things to work themselves out and we should not pretend otherwise
finally we need to be open about the elephant in the room which is that we have not yet secured funding for any of the schemes we are hoping to progress transforming a town is inevitably a chicken and egg process no funding can be secured until you have a viable scheme with public support so that is what we are working on first but postcoronavirus it is not going to be easy to get funding as your local mp i will be working alongside our local councillors to make the strongest possible case and with the pressing need to eliminate dangerous pollution from one of the most beautiful and historic towns in the south east what could make a more powerful and compelling cause",1

"more than 2000 people have died as a result of covid19 in stockholm
today is report shows that we passed 2000 deaths as a result of covid19 in stockholm county it is a difficult number to take in even for me but one thing is for sure we must not be blinded by the number behind every number there are people affected relatives loved ones relatives and friends my thoughts are with you all
our common goal is and must be that fewer people will be infected need care and above all that fewer people will die the care staff make vital contributions the majority of the sick are discharged and we still have a large capacity to receive more but we do not want to end up there therefore it is still time to think we absolutely must not relax now
the early summer days are fantastic the weather is wonderful but this is no ordinary early summer we must prevent the spread of infection at all costs and this is only done if we all continue to keep in out and distance

"campaign promises is the subject of this tuesday is video i know sometimes you are not where you can watch the video so i posted a roughdraft of the message below thanks for listening or reading i appreciate your vote in november
good evening and thanks for watching this short video as we begin to see businesses open back up and people are starting to get out and about more we are looking forward to the day that we can start having some campaign events and meet with the voters of chattooga county in person right now it looks like it will be sometime the middle to the end of june before that happens
i know that a lot of people have a lot of different ideas about the covid19 pandemic and how we all should be reacting at this time so with that in mind when we do start to do campaign events we won't be doing doortodoor campaigning for now some people don't mind someone coming by but others are still wary of allowing someone into their home or coming into contact with more people than are necessary also we still have a shelter in place order for the elderly and those with compromised immunity so i don't feel it would be right for me at this time to come doortodoor with that in mind we are tentatively making some plans for events that will be held in various parts of the county where you can come by and talk with me we can maintain social distancing and still be able to have a oneonone conversation about the issues affecting chattooga county i will keep you updated on those plans in the upcoming tuesday videos and you can always visit my web site at jimmyforcommissionercom or on facebook plus i always welcome you to call me at 7069363719
every week we have had more and more people getting on board with this campaign and the vision for a better chattooga county i continue to have conversations with people from all political persuasions and various backgrounds about issues that they find important in conversations with folks over the past week i have been asked a specific question about a specific road that needs repair in the county and was told ""i will vote for you if you will fix my road"" the voter and i had a good conversation about the need for better road maintenance in the county but i also had to tell this person that i will not make any campaign promises simply to get a vote
the fact is if you choose to vote for me in november you are putting your trust in me to do the job of sole commissioner i don't just want that trust to get me into office i want the citizens of this county to be able to trust their commissioner to do what they say if i make promises i don't know if i can keep i can't expect you to trust me to do the job i know we all get aggravated with politicians and that's why i am running i am not a career politician and i don't ""need to be commissioner"" for any other reason than i want to see our county headed in a better direction if i don't care enough about you the voter that i make a promise i don't know if i can keep then how can i expect you to put your trust in me
the biggest problem our county is facing right now is a lack of financial direction it would not be responsible of me or any other candidate to make a bunch of specific promises just to get into office because quite frankly our budgeting needs a lot of work what i can promise everyone is that when i am commissioner i will meet with citizens to discuss road and infrastructure issues i plan to hold a series of public meetings where the residents of the county can come in and speak about these issues then i plan to make a list of priorities and develop a longterm plan for fixing the issues now i know that where you live is rightfully the most important area to you so i plan to hear what people have to say and then begin to systematically address the issues once we develop a list of priorities we will then do a cost analysis on each project and prioritize those areas in the budget then we will publish that list on the internet and on social media and provide the list to local media
you see i believe that i must be accountable to you the voter publically i know that there have been many candidates over the years that have made promises in private and have then denied them in public i would much rather tell you that your road might not be fixed this year but we have it on the list for the next year than i had make you a promise just to get a vote or just to pacify the moment by looking at our list of needed road and infrastructure improvements that are published for everyone to see you the voter will know what your county is doing with your tax dollars and you will have the confidence that i as your commissioner am doing everything i can to address issues across the county aboveboard
what i am talking about is a new way to do county government as your sole commissioner i will be the one that you will approach when you have an issue i also know that the ultimate decision will be with me but i also want to involve as many people as possible in process that leads me to a decision that is why i will hold regular monthly meetings these meetings will be held for inperson comment and also will be held online where internet viewers can comment as well at those monthly meetings we will have people from public works the water district public transit and other county departments who can answer questions and help find solutions for the many issues that our county residents are facing
everything i do as your commissioner will be available for public scrutiny and inspection from our budget to our current and future plans the citizens of this county deserve to know how their county government is operating after all it is our money folks our property and sales tax dollars don't belong to a politician they belong to ""we the people""
i hope to continue this conversation between now and november i am interested in talking with you and hearing from you please contact me on facebook or email me at jimmyforcommissionergmailcom or call me at 7069363719
i appreciate you taking the time to watch this video and look forward to speaking with you again next week",1

we have today announced that we can and will take over the state is responsibility for testing priority group 3 socially important activities this means that in addition to testing patients care employees residents in special housing and employees in elderly care and care for people with disabilities we will also test for example police officers firefighters bus drivers
after a hard job recently the stockholm region now has the opportunity to test 40000 people a week just over 15000 more than what the state asked for in its original strategy but it does not stop there our ambition is to test even more testing is important from several aspects it is not least about reducing uncertainty creating security for those affected and relatives stopping the spread of infection and being able to restart sweden is economy
patients and people with symptoms should also be able to be tested if gps deem it necessary
note today we see an increase in the number who need medical care both intensive care and inpatient care it is essential that we all continue to follow the authorities recommendations keep hold in out and distance

the money the economy the reality
i have been writing lately under three different titles sometimes the subject matters overlap what starts out as psychology runs into economics what starts out as politics turns into economics and what starts out in paranormal and parapsychology turns into both
psychology can sometimes be better understood with a mix of parapsychology and economics has everything to do with our psychology in our consumer and free lacking boundaries society add to that my background a degree in management a degree in psychology 20 years in the military service leadership training you can see how things get mixed up or get connected in my head ine thing connected to another to another to another so if sometimes what you think of a a jumble actually makes a lot of sense if you ponder deep enough one thing you can know that what i am saying is probably not in everyone is mind because they dont have the same background

it took me a while to get back here eleven days to be exact but if you read my blog i havent really been gone my schedule gets busy and time gets away
back in 2008 i wrote about how we have been conditioned to expect and accept failures of others and our own also everything is normal this how things are move on
if it were a fact then why we have so many problems anxiety personality disorders addiction ruined families child abuse and neglect and much much more we really dont know how to handle life if it had become normal if we knew how to accept things we would not be having these issues but here we are we have failed the experiment we are not ready for a national disaster we are not personally responsible we cannot survive any disruption of our day to day routines and we cannot give up our habits good or bad we are not fiscally responsible as people or as a nation we are always ready to blame someone else is that not what i have been saying for the last year for the last so many years we cannot find our way without help without guidance because we have refused to learn anything
no we can not all live off the land no we cannot do our own thing brandishing weapons to buy a hamburger or to get a haircut and threaten eachother what is the difference between someone who beats up mcdonald is cashier and some that marches loaded with weapons down the street while he either cant get laid or his ole lady is screwing his buddies we cannot live without a pay check but envy those who get a hand out to survive because they have lost their job
we are not even a one nation we are not even good neighbors or good citizens that are concerned about the welfare of everyone in the country we a 325 million whinners but i said that before the covid19 disaster many of us have some strange ideas about what is freedom we think we have been brainwashed into believing that we are all privileged that whatever we want we should have we must have and it must be provided from the rich scumbags to the politicians to the police to anyone with a job and anyone without a job and welfare every single one wants something just for being the rich believe they should have all the money and the poor can go eat dirt but the poor dont even recognize and believe that money grows on trees we all claim we are the richest country in the world and then realize that we are trillions in debt so we talk about cutting socialsecurity eliminating medicaid cutting pensions healthcare benefits and veterans benefits but never about cutting the profits and outrageous pay they our owners have we have been so programmed that we fail to recognize our own miserable conditions

"midland daily news rep annette glenn rmidland who is vice chair of the house appropriations subcommittee that determines the state department of environment great lakes and energy is budget is hopeful that whitmer will reconsider assigning that investigation to egle
flood victims deserve a thirdparty independent investigation to ensure a fair and just conclusion for the thousands of families who've been devastated glenn stated in a news release late wednesday night
in april just three weeks before the two dams failed michigan attorney general dana nessel sued boyce hydro for allegedly illegally lowering wixom lake in 2018 and 2019 and killing thousands if not millions of freshwater mussels according to the lawsuit
was protecting mollusks more important than protecting the people of midland"" glenn stated in the news release and were snails more important than the people of sanford that's a question only an independent investigator can be trusted to investigate and answer
glenn said any conflict of interest must be eliminated and drew an analogy between the flooding and the flint water crisis
""we didn't trust the state department of environmental quality to investigate its own mishandling of the flint water crisis"" glenn said and after being in a lot of wet mudfilled basements this week i know it doesn't feel quite right to ask one of our own executive branch agencies to investigate whether the state shares any culpability for these devastating failures this situation clearly warrants an independent investigation""
at wednesday is news conference in sanford where whitmer announced the investigation a reporter pointed out that egle itself is being sued by four edenville homeowners in a classaction lawsuit related to the breach of the edenville dam
are you confident that if they egle find themselves at fault that they would call themselves out on that would they report that to you the reporter asked whitmer
im confident that egle will do the kind of investigation that we all deserve and that we all expect and i will ensure that that happens the governor responded
glenn said other regulatory bodies and individuals independent of the state government have the technical expertise to conduct this investigation such as the us army corps of engineers
imagine how flood victims would react if the owners of the dams announced they were directing their own staff to conduct an investigation glenn said
sen jim stamas rmidland told the daily news he agrees with glenn that egle is not the right entity to be investigating the dam failures

"my comments on extending school opening
as the parent of a year 1 child at a local primary school and a toddler at a local nursery i want to be confident that my children and all children in st helens borough as well as those who teach and care for them are returning to a safe environment we all want our children's education and enjoyment of normal school life to resume but this cannot be done at the expense of their health and safety nor that of teachers and other staff working in our schools
many of our schools have been open throughout this crisis and i thank all those headteachers teachers and staff who have provided support for vulnerable children and ensured that key workers have been able to continue in their vital work
unfortunately the government's approach to this announcement as it has been with their wider communication of how we move forward has been muddled and exacerbated anxiety and concerns it has been made clear that the reopening of schools is dependent on a number of factors a lowering of coronavirus cases a national plan for social distancing tests available for staff and pupils for each school to have planned for the safety of all and a plan to protect vulnerable teachers
i have been working with my labour colleagues and frontbench education team to urge the government to work collaboratively with trade unions who i have been in direct contact with and parents' organisations to identify and address issues within schools before the government finally confirms a date for their reopening
i have visited a local school st cuthbert is high school in parr to see for myself how schools might move towards opening up to more pupils when safe to do so it is challenging to say the least thank you to mrs twist and her excellent team for facilitating this i have also written to all schools within the constituency asking them their views on the proposed increase in pupils attending
additionally i have worked closely with st helens council and commend the cabinet member responsible for education cllr sue murphy for working closely with schools engaging with local trade unions and supporting headteachers in the decisions they come to it is also important that in these early stages parents who are concerned and choose not to send their children to school because of concerns they have are not penalised

we were told the cyclone was going to be bad but i don't think anyone really understood just how bad until it hit with a force its hard to understand if you didn't experience it first hand kolkata isn't exactly known for its strong and robust infrastructure and so when a storm of this magnitude bears down on the city it creates unprecedented havoc the gale force winds tore thousands of trees out of the ground and sent them hurling into homes and shops in many ways these trees are the backbone of the city and provide most of the shade that helps cool down the city during the intense heat of summer they help provide fresh oxygen nutrients for the soil and suck up large quantities of pollution from the air with so many ripped from the ground the long term effects will be felt in ways we can't yet imagine the torrential rain assisted by the winds flooded streets businesses slums homes and even somehow managed to reach flats over 6 stories high through exhaust vents window ac's and elevator shafts it was shocking to witness and is a strong reminder to never underestimate mother nature
as is always the case those less fortunate both people and animals have suffered the most people living in low lying areas in slums in poorly made structures consisting of one maybe two rooms have lost their homes and most of their possessions birds were killed by the thousands an unknown number of dogs and cats have drowned or been severely injured by falling debris many will not get the help they need because noone can reach them or even find them the animal people alliance team will be doing its best to help as many as possible with the limited staff it has available most staff are unable to travel to work due to lockdown but we are fortunate to have volunteers in the area that are committing to helping
as the days go on we learn more and more just how devastating the storm has been for the city and the region the economic toll for kolkata alone has been estimated at 13 billion a figure that represents about 10 of its gdp the death toll in the city is nearing 100 with surely more to come it will be a long road ahead especially as we also deal with the reality of the coronavirus kolkata and all of west bengal will overcome these challenges i have no doubt about that the people of the city are determined and strong and know how to deal with adversity better than most i hold out hope that an even stronger kolkata will emerge from the destruction and start to realize its true potential with your help i have no doubt that will be the case above text from animalpeoplealliance
help animals india is helping several groups and individuals throughout kolkatta at this difficult time we are sending through animal people alliance and also pariah dog films pariahdogfilm who are intimately familiar with kolkatta to distribute to the best rescuers here is one shelter devastated we are helping more photos here
please send any amount here to help as much as we all can",1

"how different is our life after coronavirus
every day we hear that our life after the epidemic will be completely different but no one can tell us what she will look like from what we see so far it will not be a better one we see some changes because they are brutal dramatic we dont notice others because they are much more subtle
it is no secret that a major crisis is seen by governments as a wonderful opportunity to put the governed back on their feet to bite their rights and freedoms under the absolutely perfect motivation that it is for their good and health
take a look at what we live in romania behind a simulated noisy war with an invisible enemy the government has seized almost all the levers of power and the president is leading romania in an authoritarian way and people like it i draw the conclusion from the survey that 80 of romanians are ready to give up their rights and freedoms in the name of medical safety it is sad to be part of a minority again
im very worried about a lot of things from the government is total readiness to take restrictive and punitive measures to its total lack of appetite to thaw the economy from our willingness to look hypnotized in the mouths of rulers who say nothing to the appetite of the media to maintain the exaggerated fear of a situation that is not as serious as they present it
i am concerned that our authorities have focused almost exclusively on antidemocratic measures and nothing profreedom
restricting freedom of movement was perhaps the greatest postdecember sacrifice i have ever made the same goes for banning meetings of any kind from weddings and funerals to political rallies
keeping the group limited to a maximum of three people protects any government that wants to perpetuate its political power if we add to these the total confiscation of public communication we realize what kind of foundation of democracy we are about to reach
and all this is done by a party that is just 145 days old since its establishment a party whose leaders have clogged up communist prisons just to keep us out of the pit of democracy
so how different will our lives be after as long as we allow it to be we the 20",1
"eca supports fair and safe elections being an informed environmental and climate voter who casts a ballot in every election is one of the tools we all have at hand for protecting nature not everyone wants it to be easy and safe to vote

"the meanwhile and the after
by rock
this quarantine put us to the test
in this meanwhile we learned to know our limits to live together to know each other better to think
as a society it was a challenge since the only way that our province has not yet had any cases of coronavirus is because there was a responsible attitude from each man and woman from catamarca
my great concern is for those who were and will be left out of the system the after it is like when the waters of a flood recede and for that we have to prepare now
the great strategists of history had one point in common they were several steps ahead which allowed them to better organize society in the face of events such as enemy attacks it is true that this pandemic was not expected by anyone but we do know what awaits us when this is over
that is why it is very important that as a society we begin to organize ourselves for that moment and not only for when the coronavirus pandemic passes but also for dengue which has also hit our province hard and does so with more intensity every year and which requires much more effective government policies to prevent and combat it
to begin with let is look at those who are experiencing employment problems today help them from giving them a place in a work space that may be available to any change or arrangement that is needed
we all need and deserve a decent job and each person who was left without a job whether for those who qualified for a subsidy or for those who did not requires everyone is help
union make force we need that strength more than ever
what is coming is challenging hopefully the government and each one of us rises to the occasion

"the carousel of bans restrictions and paternalism continues
in germany motorcyclists are now being restricted bit by bit people is opportunities to spend their free time the way they like are being curtailed
of course any restriction is always explained in such a way that it is about protecting people but it is not asked whether these people want the restrictions on themselves and others at all
it is no longer just about the cases where the existing and already very restrictive law is violated and punishing this violation it is about restricting entire groups through the misconduct of individuals and thereby completely losing sight of proportionality
after all we are allowed to work and more than 50 of our wages including direct and indirect taxes are taken from each of us for most top performers it is even 80 that is deducted and 20 that remains after the effort of the entire job
we swallow this to help others who have far more than we do very few people know that and you only have to look at european net worth to see that germany is by far the most battered nation in europe
we live from what little is left to us and lo and behold some even find hobbies to escape their professional stress for a few hours
one keeps his house in order mows the welltrimmed lawn with a noisy lawn mower the next grills and fills the area with music still others meet in the evenings on balconies and in gardens party loudly and the next the permanent doityourselfers so to speak among us tirelessly tinker with their houses and properties on weekends drilling hammering sawing
no problem we accept that as individualism after all we are not mice and are surrounded by silence all day long
we usually also have road traffic nearby put up with this normal noise experience trucks hammering over poorly patched streets and sometimes i may allow it sometimes there are even drivers who race with tuned cars and wedding parades that in drive past a neverending queue honking wildly
with all the noise that surrounds us it is the motorcyclists who are supposed to be a burden for people
nobody denies that such a problem for local residents exists on popular routes when the weather is nice
nobody denies that nobody wants that and nobody like me would like to live almost directly on access roads or motorways
not everyone can choose this either after all we are a densely populated country and not everyone has the opportunity to afford a wonderful house in the countryside
consideration is therefore a natural part of our lives and yes we all notice that more and more egoism is spreading and some people think they can do whatever they want
these people must be called to order by the legislature or they must be punished if they break the law
curtailing whole groups with sprawling laws and not deciding regionally and individually how to act leads us to a state of complete control that decides what to spend the last few euros that you have hard earned
apparently the corona virus has developed the urge among some politicians as a side effect to put everything and everyone in their place because it is working so well and is keeping the population politely silent
we have already gone through many groups that are supposed to be patronized in this way and it is currently hitting the motorcyclists who are simply peaceful in nature and even strengthen germany as a business location to a considerable extent
from the purchase of the motorcycle to spare parts and tourism billions flow through motorcyclists in industry gastronomy and trade
motorcyclists have already experienced a lot of restrictions especially in terms of noise protection
what is somehow not enough for the ladies and gentlemen of some parties the motorcyclist itself should be a thorn in their flesh after all the motorcyclist is one of the last symbols of freedom in our country
so a clear statement
hands off us motorcyclists the laws have been changed sufficiently there is no need for politicians who only want to distinguish themselves at the expense of our freedom

"fewer planes fewer cars fewer buses because of the corona pandemic we all live a little more locally that is good for the environment
but not in all areas companies are using more and more new plastic for their packaging instead of relying on recyclates recyclates are highquality flakes from old plastic from which new packaging is made
unfortunately this circular economy process is even more expensive for manufacturers than simply buying new plastic so not many do it with the slump in the economy caused by corona the price of crude oil has also fallen sharply in the current economic situation this naturally makes it even more attractive for companies to use virgin plastic made from crude oil
this is a huge step backwards for climate and environmental protection and a heavy blow for the circular economy says our initiative frosch founder reinhard schneider
together with colleagues from the recycling industry schneider warns of the collapse of the industry recycling must finally become more economically attractive
what is being done as part of the eu is corona aid package plans for a levy on nonrecycled plastic waste are currently being discussed long overdue to relieve the environment says schneider

"is tampa bay times still relevant
what is the purpose of journalism
journalism is a method of inquiry and literary style used in social and cultural representation it serves the purpose of playing the role of public service machinery in the dissemination and analysis of news and information
what is a journalist's oath
the journalist is creed is a personal affirmation of journalism ethics written by walter williams in 1914
what are the universal principles that guide journalism
five core principles of journalism
1 truth and accuracy
2 independence
3 fairness and impartiality
4 humanity
5 accountability
what are the ethical responsibilities of a journalist
ethical journalism has to be fair and truthful a journalist must take responsibility for their work provide contextual information update their work to fit with current changes when necessary identify their sources with clarity and ensure that they understand the motives of their sources
why do journalists need professional ethics
one of the major reasons journalists need professional ethics is the fact that these ethics can act as a fantastic guide to help journalists deal with ethical situations that they encounter in the course of performing their duties
i believe that the tampa bay times tbt acts more and more like a social media platform and has been slowly moving away from ""the five core principles of journalism"" after tbt's latest round of endorsements in this election cycle the paper took a giant leap further and further away from journalistic objectivity and integrity
i will use three specific political endorsements made by the editorial board of tbt and test the core principles against them keep in mind this is a solo effort i have limited resources to compare with the limitless resource and access that the paper has also when the editorial board of any journalism paper is involved in a decision they have a fiduciary duty to adhere to the ""the five core principles of journalism""
school board district 7 np
tbt endorsed karl nurse in this district
let's test this endorsement against some of the five core principles of journalism
3fairness and impartiality i can't see how endorsing a wealthy business owner who has no issue taking a political demotion as a prior city council member to run for school board is fair he doesn't have any experience at the k12 school level relevant to the position except the adoption of one school in one specific neighborhood
4humanity any responsible business should practice social corporate responsibility especially journalism we all have a duty to improve our environment it's not all about dollars and cents as a matter of fact the wiser business executives will tell you that social corporate responsibility and community engagement significantly improves the bottom line having said that by backing karl nurse tbt would like us to believe that a whiteonly school board is appropriate for our diverse public school system and our county
i don't think so we need diversity that can lead to inclusion at all levels of government and the fact that the editorial board failed to deliver this diversity by not choosing a wellqualified teacher and public school advocate is a degradation of the integrity of journalism
school board district 1 np
here tbt endorsed laura hine
let's test this endorsement against some of the five core principles of journalism
1truth and accuracy i happen to be a parent at the school where mrs hine would like to claim credit i can tell you this endorsement is totally wrong did the editorial group of tbt reach out to a representative population of the school to validate her claim
no
i have been at the school for 19 years where this candidate tries to claim credit here's the truth i was there and tbt wasn't during my daughters' last 2 years the north shore zone shifted 18 blocks to the south side to help improve minority students' achievement the presence of these kids prompted a bulk of white wealthy parents to leave the school this exodus brought the school grade to a 'd' we stayed and continually supported the school which despite the grade continually has had wonderful teachers and enriching programs over time the achievement gap leveled off and the school was a b when we registered our son jb for kindergarten and has bounced between a b and c ever since including 20162017 when laura hine joined my family and her group friends of north shore elementary fnse butted heads often over inclusion as a necessary component of diversity it's not enough to get a token seat at the table we need to be welcomed as equal stakeholders there was a total lack of understanding of the nuances between equality and equity all of mrs hine's programs were equal but not every student had equal access to these programs the group could not understand that the initiatives and programs they championed ignored social cultural opportunity and socioeconomic differences in our population that actually increased the achievement gap in spite of our attempts to inform them mrs hine got white parents to come back to the school in greater numbers but was this reverse migration better or worse for the marginalized students that were doing well before let's look at the available equity data at our disposal
the data reflects that disadvantaged students at north shore elementary are falling behind other students in the state and the achievement gap at the school is increasingly significant
the school is 51 white 28 black 14 hispanic and 5 other low income students made up 68 of the school population
the data also reflects that some student groups are not getting the support they need to succeed the suspension rate of white children is only 5 while all other groups combined suspension rate is 27 these issues show up in areas of academic rigor as well as there are no black children identified as gifted at north shore
with this endorsement the tbt is rewarding and praising these citizens for finally performing their civic duty to engage with their public school while failing the most vulnerable for the sake of accuracy mrs hine was always running for office from the time i met her this notion that she opted to run to save our public schools against the tyranny of a proprivate school candidate is inaccurate and frankly laughable
5accountability if tbt had done due diligence in this endorsement they would have at least requested north shore elementary pta's meeting minutes to verify her claims in this case they would have noticed the many ways in which diversity and inclusion were not deliberate but more of a burden to bear by the fnse members of the pta a recurring line item mentioning teachersstaff pay by the pta would have also raised some concerns
pinellas tax collector's office
here tbt endorsed an employee of the pinellas tax collector's office joyell bobala who quit her job at the office just in time to run
this is the only example where i actually have available performance data on both candidates recorded by the entity in question the critique of this endorsement is strictly data driven after i made a thorough public records request which tbt would have been ethically required to do but clearly didn't my conclusion of this endorsement is that it goes against all five core principles of journalism truth and accuracy independence fairness and impartiality humanity and accountability
this endorsement is such a gross dereliction of duty the tbt editorial board took the opinion of the former tax collector diane nelson as the primary motivator for its decision rather than facts and evidence this endorsement is intentionally without journalistic integrity and is based solely on gossip and political favoritism
let's dive into the data available for debate and analysis
it is evident that the current tax collector adopted a modernized and datadriven model to serve the county residents this action insulted the previous tax collector and she is now fully engaged in an effort to replace him with mediocre lowlevel staff loyal to her and the past
we will stick with the available data
according to the endorsement mrs nelson stated that wait times doubled the record showed the following wait time in fact doubled while customer and employee satisfaction are at their highest
why is this
customer and employee satisfaction are the best indicators of performance by any service provider customer satisfaction is not simply based on wait times but in the accuracy of the transaction and the fewest number of visits needed to get the job done it's an overall experience between the customer and the employee the data shows that although wait times were less under mrs nelson customer satisfaction and employee's efficacy were also lower let's see the raw data for customer followed by employee satisfaction rating
customer satisfaction in 2017 9863 in 2018 982 2019 9863
overall employee satisfaction of pinellas county tax collector employees from 2016 to 2019 is 90
the endorsement of the candidate also included one comment from an employee engagement survey any reasonable individual would agree that it is impossible to please everyone however picking one negative comment when the preponderance of the survey results were very positive is deceptive and selfserving at best
according to the employee engagement data i received the majority of employees were quite satisfied and happy with their working environment
here are some recent positive comments from the same survey regarding the current tax collector
2020 ""the leadership is to be commended for their efforts to address last year is survey feedback i have personally seen enhanced effort at building transparency and accessibility the info presented at in service day this year was the most straightforward it has ever been and many decisions were clearly made with the employees best interests in mind""
2020 ""my answers have changed a lot over the years every year i notice more and more improvement i dont remember the last time i was able to choose strongly agree agree for every question thank you for continuing to make this a great place to work and each time we need you to you show us you care about our health safety wellbeing it is noticed and appreciated""
2020 ""by far this is my favorite job ever from the training program to the people there isnt anything i would change""
if i were to play the same unethical game that tbt is engaged in i would look at employee engagement surveys from when mrs nelson was in charge and pick the following comments
2015 ""sometimes i feel like the time waited issue gets in the way of customer service there is such a concern in getting the customers in and out as fast as we can it can lead to rushing through situations where mistakes are made on a registration title or driver's license this then reflects poorly on the employees review i understand and it sure seems the customers do too that waiting for issues at the dmv is a way of life and we do it really well here but rushing through customers albeit can lead to good times but it can also lead to mistakes on the paperwork i dont think we should slow down for slow down sake maybe just put less emphasis on the time issue and more on the 0 mistake issue""
2015 ""mean what you say even in the top left corner of the page i am looking at it says world class service anytime anyplace that is not what is preached it's all about getting people out the door and keeping times below the red dont answer questions for people outside of work dont offer services of other county offices""
2016 ""be fairer and avoid favoritism when promoting an employee be more careful in choosing the right person with the preparation and abilities needed to effectively exercise a supervisory or position we observed several times how unfair is gone when the promote an employee""
2016 ""stop the favoritism a lot of people get promotions or moved to a different area of the office because they are liked more then sic others or because of who they are related too this has happened for a long time but it is happening more now then sic ever""
the data also shows a more diverse executive leadership team something that mrs nelson was not concerned with and i am afraid with this endorsement neither is tbt the agency's website depicts an agile and responsive front line to the rapidly changing needs of the citizens i also see an agency moving towards increasing accessibility specifically online and through kiosks in grocery stores this approach is proactive and forward looking
a significant data point that is often overlooked is the amount of retirees that occur with new leadership the amount of retirees did not significantly change over the past three years usually the dire and ineffective environment portrayed by mrs bobala which is amplified by mrs nelson should have yielded a noticeable increase in the number of retirees yet there was no such an exodus of eligible employees to retire 20162017 9 retirements 20172018 8 retirements 20182019 9 retirements
let's look at joyell bobala as a candidate according to public records the candidate was given a lateral transfer for failure to perform mrs bobala was supervising the tax administration department at that capacity she interviewed hired and trained 3 new employees from 2016 to 2018 and mrs bobala failed to retain any of her own recruits while the entire tax collector's office turnover rate for new hires was 21 for the same time period including her 100 turnover rate given her past statements about the value of standardized training this failure is not a surprise
do we still need journalists
as popular as social media is we still need journalists social media ""news"" is constantly clouded with people's opinions so we need journalists to report clarify and fact check everything we see and hear on social media what can we do when our journalists are acting like a biased opinionbased platform that is no different from unchecked social media
i say we need to call them out and hold them accountable to the values and principles of their profession their objectivity is needed in order to sustain our democratic system there is nothing more valuable than a free press to our system of government this is why we should not accept this bought and paid for form of journalism i am annoyed and disappointed that i must fact check my local paper and it brings no joy editorials represent the institutional opinion of the tampa bay times the collective opinions of the chairman and ceo paul tash editor of editorials tim nickens and editorial writers elizabeth djinis john hill and jim verhulst tell us that we should elect a fully white school board that includes an inexperienced parent who became aware of our public schools' issues only when it affected her family and lastly tbt would like to tell us that our tax collector's office is better off in the hands of a low level unproductive and bitter ex employee that does not believe in standardized training for all as a means to bring equity in our public service system
is tbt against racial justice equitable schools and fair workplaces
i can't tell but what i can tell for sure is that tbt has not been a friend in the fight for a better and inclusive community that can work for all
it's not a zero sum game

i put defense in quotation marks on purpose
we could get more than adequate defense for half of this price tag who is about to attack us exactly who and what army
this bill is so colossally overblown and gigantic because it is graft it is greasing palms it is payback
it is using public funds to buy political support from those who the money is being spent on
thus it is theft you should be angry
i remind you that the democratic party has majority control of the house of representatives at this time
as a jobs program funding the military industrial complex is the worst jobs program we could have studies show the cost per job is astronomical
what we should have is a green new deal jobs program putting people to work greening our energy transportation and infrastructure instead of putting them to work making weapons we dont need
again this is raiding the public coffers to curry favor and buy political support this is theft
this is corruption out in the open about 100000000 or more is spent every year on defense lobbying of congress 100 million dollars a year
and yes representative delauro voted for it
we all deserve better",1

"When we started our foundation 20 years ago, the world was, in many ways, very different than the one we live in now. It was before 9/11, before the Great Recession, and before the rise of social media. As we were thinking about what our philanthropic priorities would be, we spent a lot of time meeting with experts and studying. What we learned convinced us that the world should be doing more to address the needs of its poorest people. At the core of our foundation’s work is ... the idea that every person deserves the chance to live a healthy and productive life. Twenty years later, despite how much things have changed, that is still our most important driving principle. There is no question that this new decade is beginning at a time of tremendous unrest and uncertainty around the world. But in moments as challenging as this one—as we work to contain the spread of the coronavirus, confront climate change, and address inequality—we remain committed to supporting advocates, researchers, government officials, and frontline workers who are making a healthy and productive life possible for more people in more places. In this year's Annual Letter, Bill and I reflect on the lessons we’ve learned over the last two decades—and look ahead to what's next. We hope you'll take a moment to read it.",1

"Hello! My name is Ami Dar, I am the founder of Idealist.org , and I need to ask you a favor. I am working on a longer piece about what we could all build together, and if you have moment, it would be so helpful if you could read this segment and let me know if it resonates with you, and/or if anything is not clear or bugs you in any way. Thanks in advance, and apologies for sharing only this part. Here it is: * * * * ... We can do this, and we can do it now. We just need to st ... art. And to start, the first thing we need is to *see* each other. To see and to show that we are not alone; that across the street and around the world there are many others who want and cherish the same things we do. To do this, there are two tools we can use: a name and a symbol. Why a name? Because words count, names matter. If you are a teacher from Peru and you meet another teacher from Peru, you only have to say two words—""teacher"" and ""Peru""—to convey a lifetime of shared experiences. And if you want to start a group for Peruvian teachers, you have the words to do it. In our case the people are there, but the words are missing. You recognize these people, our people, whenever you meet them, but what do you call them? And if you can’t name them—if we can’t name ourselves—how can we connect? So let’s take a name and make it our own. A name that would mean, “freedom and dignity, generosity and respect.” A one-word bridge that would allow us to connect across our religious, national, and political differences and see how much we have in common. Let’s simply call ourselves idealists. And let’s own that name, and the values it stands for, as proudly and joyfully as we own every other part of our identity. As soon as we do this, and add that word to the string of nouns and adjectives that make up our infinitely diverse identities (“I am a wife, mother, scientist, swimmer, reader… and idealist”), two things become possible. We can connect, here and now, as easily as those Peruvian teachers. And we can look back at history, and across all our borders, and feel that in addition to our own national or spiritual traditions, we are also the heirs of every person, in every culture and era, who fought and worked for more freedom and more dignity for more people. That’s no small thing. But if names are useful, symbols can be even more powerful. Think for a moment of the impact that the recycling logo and the rainbow flag have had around the world. Now imagine if freedom and dignity had a logo. A joyful symbol that in a flash of color would allow us to say, “I am here, and I share your deepest values. And if you stand for freedom and dignity, I will stand with you.” * * * * * That's it... What do you think? Thank you!",1

"RECEIVING and BELIEVING our Prophet and Priest (Part 1) For I have given to them the words which You have given Me; and they have RECEIVED them, and have known surely that I came forth from You; and they have BELIEVED that You sent Me. John 17:8 The people of Israel had no valid excuse for their rejection of the Lord Jesus Christ. For they reveled in the prophecies of the Messiah’s glorious establishment of a physical reign on the earth. However, they utterly ignored the vit ... al passages concerning the truth that Messiah would be pierced for our transgressions and crushed for our iniquities. Of course, they should have ‘received and believed’ these truths, for they were extremely familiar with the history of the sacrificial system of the ceremonial law. Yet, they ignored these monumental prophecies concerning the ‘suffering Servant’. Instead, they focused on a physical kingdom, which they imagined would usher in an age of universal peace and the end of all hatred, suffering, oppression and disease. Furthermore, they should have ‘received and believed the Lord Jesus’, because of the overwhelming evidence of the power of His countless miracles and signs. However, the religious leaders and many of their followers attributed Jesus’ miracles to the power of Beelzebub. And yet, do you recall the moment when the disciples of John the Baptist came to the Lord from John asking, “Are You the Coming One, or do we look for another?” The Lord Jesus answered that question with these words, “Go and tell John the things you have seen and heard: that the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor have the Gospel preached to them. And blessed is he who is not offended because of Me.” Additionally, the preparation ministry of John the Baptist should have alerted everyone in Israel to the coming of the Messiah. For John was an extraordinary Prophet, who gained national notoriety. So much so, that the leaders of the nation sent an official delegation to ask him if he was the Messiah. But on the following day, John the Baptist pointed to the Lord Jesus Christ and declared, “Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.” Every person, who heard the words of the prophet, should have immediately heeded John’s testimony and ‘received and believed’ the Lord Jesus Christ. And yet, in the midst of all this overwhelming darkness, obstinate resistance and willful ignorance, this minuscule band of men both ‘received the truth that Jesus’ words were directly from Heaven; and they believed that the Lord had come directly from Heaven! In the midst of all of these hard hearts, superficial hearts and worldly hearts, the seed of the Word had supernaturally been implanted into the hearts of this paltry circle of people. The world would tell you that ‘seeing is believing’. However, the Lord Jesus turned that statement upside down and declared that, ‘believing is seeing’. In speaking to Martha, previous to the resurrection of her brother Lazarus, the Lord said to her, “Did I not say to you that if you would BELIEVE you would SEE the glory of God?” There were some who responded in hard-hearted rejection. There were others who responded with a superficial and temporary faith, which finally walked away. Still others counted the cost of true conversion and chose to cling to their worldly idols. Friend, each one of these who refused to repent and believe the Gospel were personally responsible for their rebellion. And yet, on the eve of His crucifixion, the Lord Jesus Christ could confidently pray that three remarkable miracles had occurred in the hearts and minds of these 11 disciples. They had willingly ‘received and embraced’ the incredible truths that Jesus had taught them. They had ‘received and believed’ the astounding truth that their Master had come directly from the Throne of Heaven. They had both ‘received and believed’ the majestic truth that the Lord Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the Living God! And all of their ‘receiving and believing’ had taken place, while the massive majority of their countrymen had neither ‘received nor believed’ anything of the kind! Yes, as we observe these men, they exhibited many flaws and failures in their faith. But, when we consider the extremely difficult position that they were living in and the fierce opposition that surrounded them, it is no light matter that they ‘received and believed’ on the Lord Jesus Christ. And friend, neither is it a light matter in our case, as we walk by faith in the midst of this collapsing culture. For even though our faith also displays many flaws and failures, we have a Great High Priest who is continually commending us before the Father.",1

"Growing up in a small town in Louisiana, I have had a desire to live in a major city since I was a child. Something about big cities always held an allure for me. I didn’t know then that I’d one day fulfill that desire by moving 1,200 miles North along the ""Mighty Mississippi” to a state that was part of the Louisiana Purchase — Minneapolis, MN — the home of Nativ3 HQ. Unless you’ve been camping in the wilderness or hiding under a rock, you’ve no doubt heard about the extraor ... dinary amount of unrest that began here a week ago, on May 25. On that fateful day, a white Minneapolis police officer responding to a call kneeled on the neck of an unarmed black man for a full 8 agonizing minutes, while being recorded by observers who also pleaded with him to get off of Mr. Floyd’s neck. I hate what happened to him... that his life was snatched from him so senselessly… that his killer stared ahead blankly as 45 year-old George Floyd cried out for his mother and for breath. Mr. Floyd’s killing was inexcusable and was the catalyst of what has now become nationwide protests and riots. For four nights following My. Floyd’s death, Minneapolis was under siege by rioters and looters who ultimately destroyed over 200 businesses. Some were large corporate business locations like AutoZone, Target, and Wendy’s. The vast majority of these businesses were businesses like mine. They were businesses that were the culmination of a lifetime of savings and hope and hard work. They were businesses that had been built on the backs of proprietors who worked countless hours to establish them, grow them, and serve their customers and their communities. They were mom and pop retail shops and restaurants. They were barbershops that stood as pillars in the community. They were immigrant and minority-owned businesses, woman- and veteran-owned businesses. They were businesses that served a diverse and mostly working class neighborhood of this beautiful city. They were looted and burned without discrimination. I’ve been in this city for 9 years, and it’s become a home to me. Some of my kids call themselves Minnesotans and Vikings fans (I’ve failed as a parent ... Who dat!). Two were born in neighborhoods where the ashes of burning buildings still smolder. My kids go to school in the same area. I know the exact corner where George Floyd was killed because I’ve passed it a thousand times on my way to church or music lessons or a lake to go fishing. I’ve been to the Speedway around the corner. I have deep roots in Louisiana and wholehearted pride in my bayou upbringing, but Minneapolis is where I live and work and raise my family. This city is my home. I love this city. I live in North Minneapolis, an area that knows it’s own unrest. During my time here on the Northside, I’ve coached football and baseball in the local parks, and I have met some wonderful young people. As a coach, you quickly realize that you become more than a coach to some kids and families. You become a driver and conversation partner. You become a mentor and confidant. In the course of building relationships, you hear stories. In the stories I’ve heard from some kids, I've heard my story. I see the younger, angrier version of myself that I once was in these kids. One of the pivotal moments of my life occurred as I entered the 11th grade. I had been a somewhat troubled young person, and found trouble for myself in high school. When I tried to sign up for a program called DECA, my guidance counselor assured me that there was no chance for me to be accepted due to my history. I went to the teacher myself and asked to join the program. I was accepted. DECA is a program that prepares emerging leaders and entrepreneurs in marketing, finance, hospitality and management in high schools and colleges around the globe. In DECA I travelled to New York City, Germany, and Orlando to attend training, student exchange programs, and conferences. I became an executive officer for my state chapter. My membership in DECA gave me more than entrepreneurial and leadership training. It gave me a sense of purpose and hope. This past week has been tense and difficult. There has been a heart-wrenching cry for justice that has filled our city streets and highways. The young people of this city have witnessed a war-like situation that they will never forget. And this, coming in the midst of a global pandemic that had already changed nearly every aspect of daily life. Despite the overwhelming sense of desperation that is palpable in Minneapolis, each day the people of this city get up and go clean up the mess, showing that there is hope. The opportunities that I received in DECA helped shape my future as a young adult. They gave me hope. I am committed to providing those same opportunities and hope to the youth of my community through Nativ3. Nativ3 is moving closer to the Northside, and we want to be a company that is a pillar in its community. That is why we are creating the Nativ3 Young Leaders Internship. Our internship is specifically focused on providing opportunities to high-school students who live in North Minneapolis to come for 8 weeks and take a peek into the inner workings of Nativ3. It will be a paid internship and will provide interns an opportunity to learn about entrepreneurship, marketing, coding, project management, leadership, and all of the other things it takes to run a business.

"A MESSAGE FROM LFS PRESIDENT &amp; CEO, STACY MARTIN Safety, hope, and well-being are enormously impacted by where people live, work, and play. This is a foundational consideration in everything we do at Lutheran Family Services of Nebraska. We strive every day to help people transform lives and communities and work with great humility and urgency to help dismantle the systems and barriers that continue to give advantage to some while hurting and marginalizing others. This past w ... eek, that pain was acutely felt and boiled over in the streets of our city. Because of the work that we do at LFS, we know that we live in a state with one of the highest wealth disparities in the country. We also know that Nebraska’s difference in poverty rates between white and minority communities is higher than the national average, as well as having less access to mental health care than almost all other 49 states. Our work has never been more important! With a deep understanding of the long shadow of racism and its intersection with poverty, we are engaged in the imperative work at the individual, community, state, and national levels to dismantle historical racist systems, to foster equitable environments, and to help achieve our vision of safety, hope and well-being for every person. We are dedicated to work with mercy with every individual we meet and serve and to do the hard work together toward justice. During this challenging time in our nation’s history, it is heartbreaking to see the images of brutality across the country and particularly in our own community. LFS is doing everything we can to build whole, welcoming communities in which everyone is safe and valued and treated with dignity and equality. My prayer for our communities and our commitment on behalf of all of us at LFS is that we may never tire, that we may never be discouraged of the holy work of mercy and justice entrusted to us, and that we may heal in this long fight ahead of building toward a shared and common good.",1
"Thanks to the movement we’ve built together, Alexandria will be headed back to Capitol Hill with a 73% margin of victory – a commanding mandate from the people to keep up the fight for social, racial, economic, and environmental justice.

"Every ten years, states across the country go through a process called reapportionment.

"I spent my last 2 afternoons in Juvenile Court in OK County and I have to say I was so impressed by the judge who I appeared before. She was kind but firm, strong &amp; authoritative but approachable. She celebrated the accomplishments of the kiddos &amp; parents who were stepping up and fixing their mistakes, she admonished those who needed to be for lack of progress, improvement or change but did it with humanity and dignity. She did not degrade, threaten or humiliate those who ca ... me before her. Finally she really listened to what was being said by every person appearing on the case and was willing to take a chance on doing something different than toeing the line of exactly what DHS or the DA wanted if the ultimate outcome would benefit the goal of getting the families on track for success. If the Client succeeds in a courtroom like this then our system works - children are protected, parents are able to improve their parenting &amp; coping skills, teens avoid going down a path of crime, the district attorney, DHS, OJA, the defense attorneys, &amp; the Court have all done their job. This judge is an example of my campaign for # FamiliesFirst . This is the kind of judge I will be. The goal of the juvenile justice system is not and should not be to lock up kids and parents, intimidate parents into giving up their children or for the state to raise kids. The goal is and should be helping these families through their time of need and crisis to make a better Oklahoma. I was asked and encouraged to run for the Canadian County Associate District Judge position because too many lawyers and citizens feel that the current system is not functioning properly. Change is never easy but we create a stronger tomorrow by stepping out of our comfort zone today. #FamiliesFirst # RachelforJudge",1
"My opponent, Rep. Lee Zeldin, has called the impeachment probe a “charade,” a “clown show,” and a “cocktail that is [House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff’s] favorite drink to get America drunk on.” He’s even been called Trump’s “point man on impeachment” by NBC because of how diligently he’s slandered every person involved in the impeachment inquiry, especially the brave women who have spoken out. After former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch testified about her unwarranted di ... smissal from her post in Ukraine, which came as a result of the smear campaign against her orchestrated by Rudy Giuliani and the Trump administration, Rep. Zeldin said the only reason House Democrats put her on the stand was because they “wanted her to cry for the cameras.” And he called Professor Pamela Karlan “unhinged” in response to her legal opinion on Trump’s impeachment. But as Rep. Zeldin aligns himself with the far right of the Republican Party, NY-01 is growing increasingly Democratic. Long Island now has more registered Democrats than Republicans, and The New York Times said: “Like so many suburban areas around the country, Long Island is undergoing a profound political shift.” The GOP knows that the more zealously Zeldin defends President Trump, the more vulnerable he becomes, which is why he’s one of just seven House Republicans that the right-wing American Action Network is defending as part of an emergency $7 million ad buy. That’s why I’m reaching out today. I’m Nancy Goroff, the chemist and professor running in New York’s First District to become the first female Ph.D. scientist in Congress. We raised $524,000 in our very first quarter, outraising Zeldin by more than $70,000 in individual contributions. We can absolutely win this race, but we know the GOP is going to throw millions more into defending Zeldin, and we cannot let them dominate the conversation. Please donate $25, $50, $100, or whatever you can today to help me build a campaign that can beat Zeldin and get this sexist bully out of Congress.",1

"Over the weekend, we learned of the Trump Administration’s sweeping and cruel plans to “define Transgender out of existence” with a series of new rules which would fundamentally curtail the rights of transgender Americans.

But as I’ve talked to people it's become clear to me that this election is about more than planning. This election is also about wheth ... er we have a government that is accessible to everyone, not just those who already know how to navigate it. It’s about whether our boards and committees actually encourage, rather than just tolerate, public participation and collaboration. It’s about whether we ensure that every person, every neighborhood, is included, rather than discounting people based on where they live or how long they’ve lived here.

"Sign and share the open letter from young American Jews to Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer — ""The election gave us mixed results, but in this dark time we saw many rays of light. Florida voted to re-enfranchise 1.4 million people. Over 100 women — half of whom are women of color — are headed to Congress for the first time. And, for the first time in two years, the House will finally provide a check on Trump and the GOP. Although our broken electoral system does not reflect thi ... s, the majority of Americans rejected white nationalism and a politics of hate and division. The stakes of this election were high for us. After the murder of 11 Jews in Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life Synagogue less than two weeks ago, we watched Republican candidates and elected officials all the way up to the White House double down on antisemitic tropes and racist ads. In races across the country, the GOP cynically fell in line around a message of hate and division to protect their diminishing power and relevance, even as incidents of hate crimes against marginalized communities spike. So we were surprised and disappointed to hear Speaker Pelosi begin talking about pursuing a “bipartisan marketplace of ideas” minutes after Democrats took the House. Just as we were disappointed to watch Sen. Schumer continue to blame both the Left and the Right after a bomb was sent to George Soros’ address. This kind of acquiescence and false equivalency is an absolute failure of leadership. As American Jews, we call on you to fight for us and for our friends in communities across this country who are under attack. Do not plead for civility. Do not spend the next two years “reaching across the aisle” to compromise with a party which welcomes Nazi sympathizers into its ranks or appealing to a nonexistent “center.” Do not conflate standing up against antisemitism and hate with blind support for Netanyahu’s government. We were horrified by Cory Booker’s cynical move to co-sponsor anti-BDS legislation in the wake of the Pittsburgh shooting, to use our grief to repress free speech. Standing with Jews in the moment means standing for the rights and freedoms that every person in this country, in Israel/Palestine, and throughout the world deserves. Our generation won’t sit back and watch until 2020. Young voters like us turned out in historical numbers and 67% of us — historic highs — voted against Trump’s party of hate. As young American Jews who know that our community's future depends on defeating white nationalism, we will continue to protest in the streets, challenge elected officials in the halls of power, and build solidarity so we can achieve an America that works for all of us. This isn’t a fight for which party is in power; it’s a fight for the soul of our country and the future of our world. Our generation is leading. Pelosi and Schumer, it’s not too late to join us.""",1

"I don’t regret for a minute waiting so long to launch my campaign. Nothing is more important to me than the work we did to expand Medicaid, freeze college tuition, ban foreign money from state elections, and protect a woman’s right to make her own healthcare decisions. We had a job to do in Montana. And we did it. But the DNC’s new debate rules threaten to keep us off the debate stage because I didn’t get in earlier. The truth is, if I ever had to choose again between campai ... gning for 100,000 donors and securing healthcare for 100,000 people; well, that’s the easiest decision I’ll ever make. These rules are not the standard our Party should be setting. If we're ever going to get beyond partisan gridlock and back to governing, we must include those who have done the hard work to get things done outside of Washington. I agree with Chairman Perez that every candidate has to demonstrate progress to make that stage. But if progress isn’t what we’ve been able to achieve in Montana, our Party’s definition of progress needs to change. We need a candidate that can both get Democrats fired up to vote and win back the places that voted for Trump, and I’m the only candidate who’s done it. I need your support because this is about a lot more than one debate. It’s about winning back the places we lost, getting rid of the dark money that has taken over our political system, and ensuring every person in America has a fair shot at success.

"consideration on covid19
i described in the previous post what i observed the danger of enthusiasm and my considerations on the end of the lockdown i have postponed further reflections to this moment i published an excerpt from corriere della sera in which the following news is reported while the united states approaches 100000 coronavirus deaths the new york times has decided to publish the names and short obituaries of a thousand victims in order to mark a milestone in the history of the epidemic a thousand people represent just one percent of the total death toll explains the newspaper in a brief introduction on the page entirely occupied by the text none of them were just a number i commented on this news as follows ""let is start with our 32000 dead if the irresponsible behavior of some forces those dead to a new lockdown will have been useless we will have killed them a second time or less dramatically we will have forgotten them we will have ignored them
now i can clarify why i talked about risks and write what was left in the pen risks also correspond to new opportunities some are feared and others hoped for but they are concrete
the risks are under the eyes of those who want to see the pandemic has been curbed there are treatments currently being validated and the health system has emerged from the crisis those who think they can return to their former life are wrong however and this error could cost new even partial blockages suspension of activities curfew sweeping checks blocking of all or some regions travel restrictions in case the contagion resumes extend all this until a truly effective cure or vaccine exists those who understand that life will be different because it is made adequate for living with the virus will lay the foundations for an effective restoration of normality in which everyone has the same opportunities for survival not only the young and the strong but also the elderly the immunosuppressed and the weak this understanding passes through the respect of others therefore through the adoption of the precautions dictated by the authorities to individuals distancing mask prohibition of gathering etc and prescribed for economic activities trade transport catering hotel business aesthetics etc
adapting to caution and awareness of responsibility towards others should generate a different and more aware attitude in human and work relationships in addition to the intolerance of compulsion many have discovered the value of emotional relationships and the concrete precariousness of black people has emerged in working relationships perhaps the time for kisses in the wind superficial relations and electoral handshakes will have passed every physical contact will involve a risk therefore a choice every human relationship will involve a cost therefore an evaluation each job will have to protect the worker and whoever benefits from it employer and consumer tending to disadvantage the black person or aggravate it if the controls are not adequate
all this will be able to sweep away the old structures and bring the crisis where it exists to its extreme consequences but will allow those who have courage inventiveness and will to start again in this way it will be possible to reestablish unsafe activities and face a new market in a new way within a synergistic network that allows to share costs and risks in this the sienese valdichiana can have its say anchoring the supply network to some entrepreneurial cornerstones which it owns and to the support intervention of local state and european authorities the valdichiana has a solid starting point that must be defended and consists of obvious facts the absence of significant contagion in the municipalities of the area only about 150 to date thanks to our mayors who have had a firm pulse and to the communities that responded responsibly to the sacrifices of the lockdown and the specific tourist vocation the green flag of the contagion that few can wave the possible capture of tourist flows diverted from the sea where applying the precautions is objectively difficult and the tourist vocation to wellbeing thermalism highlevel catering famous products such as wine meat etc hotel and agritourism services of great potential landscape and historical beauties represent a new opportunity for the valley however it must be grasped on the fly we will talk about this again and more concretely also in the perspective of the resumption of work for the television format already announced and suspended due to the lockdown it would also be appropriate to talk about it in the union of municipalities of the sienese valdichiana perhaps in a conference during the planning phase of the restart",1

Phillip Sample; Ex. Dir. RAHAM Detroit ""if we can, we will"" FICPFM Network, Since we've launched this action, members from across the country have been turning up the heat on AG William Barr, BOP Director Carvajal and several U.S. Attorney's, flooding their inboxes with emails and demanding that they release our people faster. We must keep up the pressure! If you have not done so already, click on the link and take action! Also, forward the link to 6 people right now asking them to do the same. Lastly, copy and paste the link onto your social media pages today. Despite Attorney General Bob Barr’s order to expedite the release of people to home confinement, the federal prison system is an escalating complex of disease and death. Correctional officers, who are forced to work until they show symptoms of sickness, have transmitted the disease from their communities into countless facilities. One low-security facility, Oakdale FCI, in Louisiana, has had at least five people die in the past week. The prison will no longer test anyone, and correctional officers are openly complaining about their own high infection rates. This order may prove to be too little too late. Click LINK to TAKE ACTION NOW!! Bureau of Prisons (BOP) Director Michael Carvajal is a former correctional officer and was the warden of FCC Pollock, a facility less than an hour away from Oakdale. Wardens are trained in security, not viral outbreaks. BOP reports infected people across 15 states, with the women’s facility in FCI-Danbury (CT) as well as USP-Lompoc (CA) having double-digit reported cases; and every day that number grows, despite the lack of testing. The truth is likely far higher. The virus spreads while people are still reporting for work, with no temperature or cough, before they even show symptoms or can use a sick day. Demand that they TAKE ACTION NOW! The federal government has proven that people are at a high risk of death, and they are unable to protect people or provide adequate medical interventions. As resources become scarce, they have neither the legal nor moral right to detain people. They need to ease the pressure on facilities in order to help those that remain.

"CAPITALISM AND THE VIRUS The pandemic caused by the virus has forced us to “pause” our lives and confront so many personal and societal issues, exposing some of the cracks not only in our personal lives, but in our entire economic system, including cracks in the very foundation of capitalism itself. Many around the world have been exploring these issues, seeing that, perhaps, we are at a time in history when we can and must refocus our lives and priorities. On a personal le ... vel, in the quiet of forced isolation, we have faced the nearness of death all around and the fact of our own mortality, and we have begun to look more closely at our motives and values. Our obsession with success, wealth and buying “things” can suddenly appear shallow and unfulfilling in the face of simple acts of kindness, love of family and friends, and the wonder of a quiet day or walk through the neighborhood. On a larger level, the flaws in our obsession with greed and the accumulation of material goods and with growth for its own sake are becoming increasingly apparent. We see more clearly what has been obvious all along: the vast disparities in wealth; the extent to which concentrations of economic power have distorted our values and lives; the extent to which so many have been living on the edge financially and have been thrown into despair as the economic downturn rips through their limited resources; how so many “essential” workers are undervalued and underpaid; and how the poor and minorities have been suffering disproportionately during the pandemic, both in term of health and the ability to survive. An awareness of all of these things raise deep questions about the lack of humanity and justice in our capitalist system, with its stress on consumerism, materialism, exaltation of individual greed, and fulfilling our immediate wants. We don’t see each other and don’t appreciate the inherent dignity and worth of all people or the precious wonder and value of all life on our planet. It may now be time to reevaluate our capitalist obsession and addictions and begin moving to a more equitable and compassionate economics. I am not talking about moving to some other existing economic systems, but, rather, to something new that is a gentler form of commerce that recognizes our interdependence with each other and with the planet. The creation of wealth and a thriving economy is clearly important, but is it an end in itself or only a means – albeit a very important means – to achieving something more valuable? What are our real, first priorities? To what end are we working so feverishly in trying to create wealth and protecting those who do it? Is it simply a desire for profit and accumulating money as an end in itself? A materialistic glorification of money? To what extent is it wise to allow greed and avarice to run wild and allow unprecedented concentrations of economic power in the hands of a few? Concentrations of any kind of power tends to corrupt, unless checked, and this certainly includes concentrations of economic power. These are questions for us both individually and as a society. Indeed, it is hard to see how creating wealth can be an end in itself. The growth of technology and wealth are certainly essential to our efforts to evolve into a more caring, healthy, free and safe society that can ensure our basic needs and that our survival is safeguarded. In the end, however, our wealth and physical possessions (our cars, our electronic gadgets, our bank accounts and even our worldly achievements and successes) cannot give us lasting happiness or peace. For that, we need to look within our own hearts, to the light of our higher selves. There is an inner point of stillness within each of us; and out of this inner stillness comes that quiet voice of conscience urging us to embrace true, lasting values, such as: integrity, reverence for life, loving-kindness and wisdom. All of our physical wealth and possessions, no matter how useful or necessary in the short run, are blown into nothingness over time in the face of the inherent impermanence of this universe and, most finally, in the face of our own inevitable deaths. The virus is driving that point home to anyone who cares to look around. It is a cliché to say that the most important and valuable things in life are free and cannot be given a dollar value. Capitalists tend to forget the wisdom of this cliché and are too often guilty of trying to reduce all of life to monetized events or items, thereby shifting society into a narrow, money driven obsession. We need, instead, a balance in which the pursuit of wealth is seen only as a means to greater ends.",1

"At its core, restorative justice is about relationships—how you create, maintain, and mend them when a harm has occurred. It is based on the philosophy that we are all interconnected, that we live in relationship with one another, and that our actions impact each other. Restorative justice asks us to see each other and recognize the dignity in everyone, and to honor the collective as well as our individual responsibility to the whole. By practicing restorative justice, we beg ... in to shift the power dynamic from holding “power over” others to sharing power. We recognize each person's individual agency and value the insights and wisdom of everyone, not just those traditionally regarded as experts. In other words, we are each experts about our own lives and experiences. Join Associate Director of Impact Justice’s Restorative Justice Project Ashlee George for a dynamic workshop exploring the basic philosophies, principles, and practices of restorative justice through experiential activities, reflection, lecture, and discussion. By the end of this workshop, participants are able to design and lead a community circle, explore steps to repairing harm, and integrate restorative justice practices into their own lives. This is an opportunity for participants to join together for a journey through self-exploration and storytelling. Although the term restorative justice is relatively new, the practices and underlying philosophy can be connected to Indigenous peoples’ around the world approach to relationships, community building and addressing harm. The way restorative justice is practiced in the western world today is largely influenced by the indigenous people of the Americas and Aotearoa (New Zealand). With this in mind, Ashlee is committed to taking great care to avoid appropriating Indigenous peace-making processes. This workshop is for all people who want to learn more about restorative justice and its application in various settings while building community. This workshop meets on Saturday &amp; Sunday, November 16th &amp; 17th, 2019, 10am-5pm.",1

He’s left us behind in Ohio’s 15th District, only voting the way Washington Insiders and corporations tell him to, and not addressing the issues that matter most to Ohio families. Unlike my opponent -- who has taken over $35,869,646 from PACs between his campaign, leadership PAC, and the NRCC -- I made a commitment to not accept a dime from corporate PACs, and I’m keeping that promise. We are running a people-powered campaign, supported by hardworking people, who want to get big money out of politics and who want to see real change in Washington.",1

"BUFFALO NEWS: Everybody's Column Seamans offers change the 61st District needs I want to thank The Buffalo News for the Oct. 7 article about the importance of the New York State Senate races. The article clearly highlights the likely shift in power from Republican to Democrat and what this means for Western New Yorkers. Living in the 61st State Senate district means I need to look very closely at the candidates. I have no doubt in my mind that it is of utmost importance to el ... ect Joan Elizabeth Seamans. Seamans clearly represents the values of most voters in the 61st District. Her staunch advocacy for the responsible use of taxpayer dollars, as well as the creation of accessible quality health care for all, are two issues that ring loudly for Western New Yorkers like myself. Seamans also supports legislation that advocates for the decent and respectful treatment of all people, from all walks of life. On the other hand, Mike Ranzenhofer is beholden to many special interest groups, for years refusing to support legislation to close the LLC loophole for campaign contributions. At the same time, he’s been wasting taxpayer dollars promoting himself through mass mailings, often coinciding with his election campaigns. Furthermore, he has refused to answer questions about his contacts and communications with, and monies received from, lobbying groups that oppose the Child Victims Act. Ranzenhofer also voted against the Senate bill (S8121) to remove firearms from domestic violence offenders. Thankfully, others in the Senate saw things differently and that bill is now state law. What is he thinking? Whose interests is he really representing? If he won’t protect vulnerable victims, just who is he interested in protecting? We need a state senator whose core values are in step with Western New Yorkers, and who will represent us in the new Democratic majority. It’s time for a change. It’s crucial. Kirk Frieh Amherst",1

"Stand with Communities, Not Corporations! Protect Mother Earth. End Climate Capitalism. Support Community Solutions. In September, Governor Jerry Brown is convening the Global Climate Action Summit (GCAS) in San Francisco to promote his “real climate leadership” credentials on a global stage. But Jerry Brown’s promotion of carbon trading markets and other perverse subsidies to oil, gas and other polluting corporations only perpetuates climate change, and decimates Indigenous ... communities and Native nations, communities of color and other working class peoples throughout California and around the world. Such incentives for “climate capitalism” will turn frontline communities into sacrifice zones for decades to come, and despite Brown’s attempts to prove he is different from Trump and the dark forces of climate denial, his “climate leadership” promotes the same corporate agenda – aimed at expanding the dig, burn, drive, dump industries destroying our communities and the air, land and water we depend on. Join us to stand in solidarity with Indigenous and frontline communities protecting Mother Earth, and cultivating real solutions to the twin crises of climate change and capitalism.

"Despite the daily drumbeat of shootings and killings in the City of St Louis..the Board of Aldermen is taking time out with legislation to try to ban horse drawn carriages. You really can't make this up. Just this week 4 people were shot last night on MLK Drive and Goodfellow. Today a double shooting on RIverview and North Broadway. So far this year there have been 18 murders in the City of St Louis, that's nearly one every other day. The city's crime is the main topi ... c of many people in our area. After all people do still come into the city for work and for Hockey game and for Baseball Games when the season starts, even for entertainment. They have a vested interest in what Officials are doing to try to make St Louis safer. Right now this seems to be a city of indescriminate gunfire. It's something more akin to the Wild Wild West than a city of law and order. Right now it seems more like law and disorder. So we need City Officials to be putting all their resources into making this city safer and figuring out how to cut down on the violence. But what capturing the attention of the Board of Aldermen? Banning horse drawn carriages that's what. The measure passed an aldermanic committee this week to ban the carriage companies from the streets of St Louis. The legislation is going to be presented in the full Board tomorrow. Next week the Board will take the vote on whether to make it final. I talked to some of the carriage owners who are just stunned by this effort that would wreck their business and put their workers out of work. They find it hard to believe that with all the troubles in this town the Aldermen would take up time trying to ban horse drawn carriages, something that a lot of tourists and others like.. This is city that's steadily losing attractions. The carriages are one of the attractions that many people still like when they come downtown. The horses have been the target of animal rights activists. Of course you know how much St Louis city officials like to try to curry favor with activists.. It seems sponsors of this legislation are intent on hurting small businesses which is what the carriage operators are. BUt theres a twist in this deal. The State Legislature is working on a measure to overturn any carriage ban that passes the Board of Aldermen. It's an animals right to work measure. The proposed ban by the city just one more incredible distriction for city officials that really need to be focused on the important issue at hand like violent crime that's leaving way to many people wounded and killed. It just makes you wonder what world are city officials living in when they have time for Confederal Monuments in the park, and horse drawn carriage when all the while the city is going down fast.. It just puts you in mind of that old adage attributed to the Roman emperor Nero. Fiddling while Rome burns.",1
"The Capital Region Organizing Project aims to develop a new organizing effort in the Sacramento region that invites congregations, organizations and labor unions to unite with the interests of environmentalists, young urban professionals, immigrants, workers, and people of color to provide opportunity, justice and power for everyone.

We bring together organizations that hold similar values based on social justice, democratic capacity building, and leadership development. We are working to advance the engagement and leadership of all people in the Sacramento region. We propose to support individuals to become leaders within their organizations, challenging them in their capacity to change the structures that affect their lives, and then for those organizations to unite with each other to create positive changes in our community. The beauty of the region we live in is clouded by the reality that broad sectors of people live in the shadows of such immense wealth. Demographically, the population of people of color, immigrants, and concerned residents is booming, but our numbers are not parallel to our influence in shaping public policy. This is why we propose to create a regional power organization that draws its strength from the values of member organizations, providing leadership trainings, issue dialogue, democratic decision-making processes, and engagement in public policy. Please join us on February 15 to dig into a deep discussion about the need for a regional organizing body to unite people to build power.

"Mark your calendars!! Nov 27th is # GivingTuesday and Facebook will match donations up to $7 million dollars. AND the easiest way to participate is for you to start your own fundraiser for AWN Network right here from our page. Please feel free to use our #GivingTuesday graphic for your posts, as well as any of the following information about the work we're accomplishing at AWN Network!! Advocacy &amp; Activism: AWN seeks to develop informational materials in several areas to educate the public about the Autistic experience and to provide support and advocacy to these communities. AWN Network’s Committee on Autism &amp; Ethnicity aims to educate the public about the impact of race and culture on our Autistic identities. The committee published the anthology: “All the Weight of our Dreams: on living racialized autism.” In addition, the committee runs a grant program for Autistic people of color. Divergent: when disability &amp; feminism collide is an initiative of AWN Network which seeks to explore the impact of sexism and ableism in disabled and nondisabled communities. Divergent is run exclusively by disabled people of varying identities and disabilities. The committee plans to host a Symposium and publish an anthology of discussions from the one day conference. AWN Network has an ongoing Health Provider Survey with a linked database listing intimate care providers. These providers offer sensory friendly and accessible health care. In our work to develop more inclusive and accessible communities and opportunities, AWN Network focuses on challenging societal attitudes about the worth of disabled lives. Autistic Women &amp; Nonbinary Network welcomes all women, both transgender and cisgender, non-binary and genderqueer people, Two-Spirit people, people who have at any time identified as women or girls, and all other people of marginalized genders or of no gender. AWN recognizes and affirms all people’s gender identities and expressions, as well as choices about disclosure, transition, and going stealth. AWN Network’s major accomplishments include: • Two Publications: ** The Girls Anthology is a compilation of twenty (20) essays by autistic people to communicate to parents of autistic girls what their daughters are going through during various stages of their growth and maturity. “What Every Autistic Girl Wishes Her Parents Knew” is the book that many adults on the autistic spectrum wish their parents would have had access to when they were growing up. In this first girls anthology book release from AWN Network, the autistic contributors write with honesty and generosity about the emotional needs, sensitivity, and vibrancy of autistic girls. Containing thoughtful and practical encouragement and support for parents and compiled from the acquired wisdom and experience of autistic individuals, parents are finding this collection of essays an invaluable resource for supporting their autistic daughters in developing strength, trust and confidence in themselves, and in the world. ** All the Weight of Our Dreams: on living racialized autism, is a collection of essays, poetry, fiction, and art from over fifty (50) autistics of color on the experience of living in a world being autistic and non-white. An excerpt from their webpage describes the anthology project in this way: “For those of us who are autistic and racialized, we often struggle to find representation in mass media, academic work about autism or race, and the activist and advocacy movements that focus on autism, neurodiversity, disability rights, or racial justice. Most autism and autistic organizations, publications about autism, and broader neurodiversity campaigns are predominantly white. Yet disabled Black and Brown students are most likely to be impacted by the school to prison pipeline; the vast majority of U.S. prisoners are disabled and Black or Brown; racialized people are a global majority (which means that autistic people of color far outnumber white autistic people in the world); and the combined impact of race and disability severely increase likelihood for hate crimes, police violence, all other forms of abuse, and repeated retraumatization. Our stories matter and must be told. We hope that this collection will not only speak sharply against our constant erasure and invisibility as (at least) doubly impacted but will also provide solace and familiarity for our own out there waiting for stories like theirs to be told.” * The first of its kind Health Care Survey and Resource List. This database lists gynecologists (and other intimate care providers) who offer accessible and sensory-considerate health care to women and non-binary people on the autism spectrum. * Since 2009, production of more than 200 original articles have been published on AWN Network’s blog. * Social Meetup Groups: Social Meetup Groups donations will help us come together for planned activities, outings and social meetups at a variety of venues such as coffee shops, restaurants, movie nights, arts &amp; crafts days and more. Donations will also go toward transportation vouchers. Examples include gas vouchers for those in need of financial assistance or to help those in rural areas where public transportation is limited and inaccessible. * Networking &amp; Web Development: AWN provides an interactive website to educate, empower and provide support. Donations will pay for costs associated with all web development, maintenance and security upgrades in order to provide online resources to our community. Your support will also help AWN Network educate and advocate via various social media platforms. Thank you so very much for your support!!

"Color of Change PAC is supporting Wesley Bell for St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney because Wesley is committed to transformative criminal justice solutions to ensure all people, particularly people of color, receive fair and equal justice under the law. This means not putting children in adult prisons. For too long, we’ve locked up children in jail with adults. Jailing young people in adult prisons put them at a higher risk for assault and violence. If we’re going to transform out justice system, this practice has to end. On August 7th, St. Louis County has an opportunity to ensure that Black voters shape political agendas and move the needle on issues that plague our community. But first, we need your help. Vote Wesley Bell for Prosecuting Attorney on August 7. Get all the details about voting!",1

"STATEMENT ON SHOOTING AT CHABAD OF POWAY, CA: The Jewish Federation of Greater Washington , JCRC of Greater Washington , and our Greater Washington Jewish community are angry and horrified by yet another senseless, violent, antisemitic attack on an American synagogue, this time at the Chabad in Poway, California. One person has been killed and three others, including a child, have been injured. We mourn the loss of life, pray for the quick recovery of the injured, and stand in ... solidarity with our brothers and sisters in the Poway and San Diego Jewish communities. This heinous act of hate was perpetrated against innocent adults and children peacefully gathered to celebrate Shabbat and Passover and recite the sacred Yizkor memorial prayer for those we have loved and lost. It comes six months to the day after our nation’s deadliest ever act of antisemitism at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. We are deeply angered at the escalating string of attacks on synagogues and the continued, increasing tide of antisemitic incidents overall in the United States. Enough is enough. From attacks against the Muslim community in Northern California this week to last week’s attacks against Christians in Sri Lanka to the burning of black churches in Louisiana, we must not allow our society to be ripped apart by the scourge of hatred, resentment, scapegoating, and polarization that we are now witnessing. As a country, we must stand together and condemn all forms of hatred and bigotry. We must be clear that language matters. Openness to hate speech creates openness to deadly actions. Houses of worship of all faiths are places of holiness, reverence for life, and peace. At their best, they reflect the highest ideals and aspirations of our democracy and of the human spirit. We must put a stop to the encroaching normalization of the kind of attacks suffered today at Chabad, at the Tree of Life Synagogue, and at mosques, churches, Sikh temples, and other worship spaces in the United States and worldwide. We join all people of good will in condemning the rising tide of white nationalism, racism, antisemitism, and other hatred that is at the root of this violence. An attack on one community is an attack on all Americans and on everything for which our nation stands. We must stand together and condemn all such attacks. Within our local community in the Greater Washington area, the JCRC and The Jewish # Federation have been in close contact with all local and regional law enforcement agencies. Patrols and police presence have been increased at synagogues and other Jewish institutions in our region. We thank our partners in law enforcement for their support and their speedy response, and we will continue to work with them to coordinate community security. JSSA , the Jewish Social Service Agency, is available to help people individually or through our institutions and synagogues to cope with tragic events and to promote the resiliency of our community. If you would like to inquire about counseling for yourself or your family, please contact Scott Kreeger at (301) 610-8381, or inquire through JSSA’s intake department at (301) 816-2633.

"Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness for ALL? We at Resist reflect on this nation’s promise to its citizens: the right to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” A promise that has been broken time and time again as those most impacted by oppression are restricted to the margins of society - bereft of resources, options, and hope. And today is no different. Our worst fears are being realized. Emboldened by Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation, right-wing lawmakers are introducing anti-abortion legislature with the explicit goal of overturning Roe v. Wade… and denying all people of their reproductive rights. We knew this fight was coming. Which is why, thanks to you, our grantees are at clinics, schools, community centers, and in the streets fighting misinformation and prejudice at every turn. Now we need you and every other Resister to express the full magnitude of your disgust and outrage today because the Trump agenda is as ugly as it gets. We need to raise $135,000 by July 31st to make sure that our grantees hold strong in these hostile times; that they protect the rights of all people, especially those living on the edge. You and I know that abortion bans and heartbeat bills have never been about “saving lives”—they’re about perpetuating systemic racism and sexism, and above all, control. The United States is one of only 13 countries in the world where the maternal mortality rate is WORSE than it was 15 years ago, and Black women are four times more likely to die in childbirth than their white counterparts. Resist grantee Southern Birth Justice Network (1) refuses to be complacent. Through direct community outreach, popular education, and engaging storytelling, Southern Birth Justice Network is advocating for proper and comprehensive health care across the pregnancy spectrum, including abortion, miscarriage, prenatal, birth, and postpartum care. They provide teens and parents with alternative birthing options, midwifery, and doula care—vital tools for survival not found anywhere else in their community.

"What is the Middle, and Why is it Important? Hello, my name is Jade, and I’m just an average guy living in the purple state of Colorado. I grew up in Minnesota and South Dakota, fired artillery for the Army in Oklahoma, paid for college with the GI bill, and lived on both coasts. I have a purple extended family and live in a purple neighborhood. I could go on, but the point is I’ve seen a broad cross section of America. I’ve had conversations with many good people about t ... he virtues of different ideas and principles that end up falling on both sides of the purple divide. I love America, what we stand for, and who we are. But I’m also mad as hell. I’m mad that we’ve been reduced to yelling at each other about the unequivocal rights and wrongs of blue or red. We have lost our ability to talk about the middle, and I want to try and do something about it. This is my third post. My first post, “All People Are Generally the Same,” describe how this country is filled with 95% good people which sit on both sides of the purple divide. My second post, “The Center Never Changes, But Opinions and Politics Do,” define what the middle is, and how our imperfect system creates change. My goal is to look at things in different ways that will challenge both sides. I’ll know if I’m staying true to this mission if the disagreements (and hopefully discussion) are coming from both sides. Based upon the comments in the first two posts, I’ve succeeded. The middle is important because they decide elections. Special interests and political strategists hate the middle because they have to win their vote every election. They’ve been systematically polarizing and dividing the country so the divided electorate is only voting for their team rather than a complicated set of ideas with many shades of gray. The polarized process has pushed for candidates more extreme with each election cycle, as they try to get their even more polarized sides into their corner. This positive feedback cycle is destroying the power of the American electorate’s ability to work in its own best self interest. This page’s mission is to try to break that feedback loop and facilitate a conversation around the middle of politics. Here are some of the ground rules I’m imposing on myself to make the mission work. I’ll talk about issues which are important to understand the middle, will push the outside towards the middle, or engage topics which create debate from each side. It’s impossible to be unbiased, but hopefully depending on the week, you will see positions from different sides of the purple divide. If my self-bias on a particular issue is such that I don’t see value in the other side, I’ll refrain from discussing it in this forum. I plan to write one post a week with a $20 budget but will mostly depend on “sharing” to reach a broader audience. Here are some ground rules for those whom decide to participate in the comment section. I love hearing your original thoughts and seeing respectful debate. Although I have the power to delete comments, I will only do so if you are overtly disrespecting other participants, or are intentionally trying to subvert the goals of the page. Additionally, going forward, I will delete any post that has a meme. Memes are ideas created by other people to propagate unoriginal thought, and don’t belong here. I’m also looking for great ideas for future posts. I hope you’re looking forward to this experiment as much as I am. @JustOneDumbGuy -Sometimes we disagree.

"When I was a little girl – the very first time ever visiting the nation’s capital – my father took me to the reflecting pool. We were on a road trip from New York to Florida visiting family. He rested me on the side of the reflecting pool and had my toes dipped in the water and had me look at the Washington Monument. He had me look at the Capitol. He had me look at the entirety of the nation's capital. And he pointed to all of it and he said, “This belongs to all of us. It be ... longs to you. And it belongs to me.” What I want to tell the children, what I want to tell the immigrants in this country, and what I want to tell all people across this country is that no matter what the president says, this country belongs to YOU. And it belongs to EVERYONE. We have a choice to make, because America has always embodied the story of those who seek to advance freedoms for all people, and those who try to conserve them as privileges for a select few. Each of us must decide who we will be in America’s story. This campaign has made its decision and we’ve chosen the side of the people. Donald Trump has decided he does not want to be President of the United States. He does not want to be a President to those who disagree. And he’d rather see most Americans leave than handle our nation’s enshrined tradition of dissent. But we don’t leave the things we love. They can stay busy defending racism.

"why vote donald trump out of office because he is a rotten person and a terrible president updated
we have got to stop donald trump from winning a 2nd term here is why
he is arrogant he is corrupt he is incompetent he is a compulsive liar he tells ridiculous provable lies on a regular basis if you visit politifactcom youll find they rate 71 of what trump says as either mostly false completely false or pants on fire false all politicians bend the truth some of the time but trump is in a class all by himself
on the world stage he angers our allies and buddies up to brutal dictators who murder journalists and other people they see as political enemies trump is all in with that kind of thing yeah that is what we should be doing here in america is killing journalists who make me look bad
he is destabilized the middle east with terrible decisions like withdrawing from the iran nuclear deal moving the us embassy in israel to jerusalem and his abrupt withdrawal of us troops from syria predictably israel now fires missiles at iran and kills more palestinian protestors scores of kurdish fighters who helped us defeat isis have been killed and isis has regained strength and become a larger threat
he is destabilized the world economy and our economy with tariffs and trade wars he is utterly destroyed the us economy with his highly inept response to the covid19 pandemic more on that below the us stock market had been mostly treading water for almost 2 years before covid19 the dow jones lost a thousand points or 2 every time a trade deal with china fell through we just recently reached a partial deal that mostly benefits china trump cant negotiate his way out of a paper bag there have been manufacturing layoffs and farmers in the midwest have lost a ton of money as a result of tariffs weve been bailing farmers out with trump subsidies ie taxpayer dollars
in 2016 trump promised to eliminate the national debt in 8 years before covid19 he had increased the national debt by 3 trillion and was on track to increase it by another 6 trillion if reelected if he gets what he wants the only way hell cut spending is on things like social security medicare and medicaid
trump is the most corrupt individual ever to serve as president the man is up to his eyeballs in scandals that have among other things put many people from his inner circle in prison and have gotten him impeached trump interferes in department of justice cases that affect him politically and recently he is been pardoning as many white collar criminals as he can the fact that trump currently has more than 2000 business conflicts of interest alone is completely unacceptable trump is favors can be bought by world leaders foreign businessmen and members of congress drain the swamp trump is the swamp if hillary clinton had been elected and pulled 10 as much of this garbage everyone on fox and friends would be losing their minds
the trump white house is a 3 ring circus he is had a ridiculous turnover rate his administration is riddled with vacancies any intelligent competent individual who has worked for this administration has either been fired or run out the door screaming anyone who has or is working for trump will tell you he is a nightmare to work with his management style is to pit people against one another he gets some kind of sick pleasure from it like watching a dog fight do you think this is an intelligent style of leadership i sure as hell dont
ive never seen an administration embrace racism toward minorities and general bigotry with wide open arms the way the trump administration has between his asinine remarks about colored democratic members of congress going back to the countries they came from classic bigot speak or calling their districts rat infested hell holes his atrocious immigration policies and his coddling of white supremacists in charlottesville i can think of no comparison a partial travel ban aimed at preventing muslims from entering the country separating children from their parents to deter migrants seeking asylum appalling let is talk about his pardoning of former sheriff joe arpaio in arizona arpaio was convicted of criminal contempt for racial profiling for illegally detaining latinos he thought looked like undocumented immigrants and placing them in detention centers with horrific conditions he was ordered by a federal judge to cease and desist and he refused the only reason this guy isnt in prison is because he was pardoned by donald trump as a result this numbskull was able to run for us senate in arizona in 2018 thank god he lost in the primaries but he did get more than 20 of the vote and while he was on the campaign trail he was endorsed by none other than vice president mike pence you cant make this stuff up there are no dog whistles anymore just bullhorns yeah were racist and howdaya like that
trump is environmental policies are a disaster he is rolled back all kinds of regulations to allow companies to dump toxins into our air and water he pulled the us out of the paris climate agreement despite the fact that 97 of climate scientists agree global warming is caused by industrial pollution and other human activities trump couldnt care less as long as he is making money for the people who fill his campaign coffers
trump is response to the covid19 pandemic has been an incompetent mess of epic proportions he was given intelligence on how badly the pandemic could affect the us in january of 2020 the us got its first confirmed case on january 20th trump should have immediately regulated all air traffic coming in from china and europe he should have implemented massive testing tracking of people who were exposed and isolation of those who were infected south korea required travelers arriving from places like italy to be put in quarantine for 2 weeks he also should have invoked the defense production act to manufacture emergency medical supplies like masks gowns gloves and ventilators in case the virus got out of hand he did none of this instead he sat with his thumb up his butt for 2 months and consistently lied to the american people about the size and severity of the threat the number of potential cases and deaths and called covid19 the latest hoax from democrats trying to make him a oneterm president eventually by mid march trump declared a national emergency there are now over a million cases of covid19 in the us and were probably going to see between 130000 and 200000 deaths before it is all over trump continues to fail miserably to get testing distributed across the country to get emergency medical supplies to hospitals that need them and to encourage several red states who never issued stay at home orders to instruct people to take precautions like social distancing and wearing masks he is now pushing states to reopen too quickly because he is afraid the massive economic damage his inept response has caused will cost him the election because trump failed to prevent much unnecessary spread of the disease congress has had to pass several stimulus bills adding trillions to the national debt the stock market has crashed and unemployment is expected to be in double digits for at least several months
and let is remember a few reasons why trump is a revolting person in general this is a man who raised money for st jude is hospital for children with cancer and then used some of that money for his business instead this is a guy who mocked the disability of a handicapped journalist in front of thousands of people at a campaign rally this is a guy who has encouraged political violence at campaign rallies do me a favor knock the crap out of him for me will ya dont worry ill pay your legal fees yeah like you should trust trump to make good on a promise to pay anything this is grossly irresponsible behavior for anyone running for public office you dont encourage an angry mob to beat up people who disagree with their political views this is a man who was caught on tape bragging about sexual assault grabbing women by the py and kissing them without permission on and on and on
and i dont want to hear about how the economy had generally been doing well before covid19 couldnt care less trump is not the only person capable of presiding over a healthy economy and for the most part he can claim no credit for the economic strength we had before the pandemic
trump is the worst president we have ever had and an even worse person the country cannot survive 8 years of this creep vote him out",1

den endorses european fund for building renovation
main goals significantly increase renovation rates strengthen europe is cohesion
the german energy advisor network den ev supports proposals for a european fund for building renovation we welcome the initiative of the renovation fund for all europeans campaign and support it says the chairman of the den dipling herman dannecker the initiative supported by over 120 institutions and companies from all over europe addresses the president of the european commission ursula von der leyen in an open letter and suggests that as part of an economic reconstruction program following the to set up a recovery fund for all european countries in the wake of the covid19 crisis which will release 100 billion euros a year
it is now important to combine measures for an economic recovery with an effective climate protection policy at the same time you have to take this opportunity to send a strong signal to all eu member states that the climate crisis can only be answered together said dannecker the campaign letter is not only addressed to the president of the commission but also to vice president frans timmermans who is also commissioner for climate protection to commissioner for energy kadri simson to commissioner for internal market and services thierry breton and to the commissioner for budget and administration johannes hahn
in their letter the signatories welcome the plans formulated in the socalled green deal to at least double building renovation rates in europe from the current 1 per year the creation of a recovery fund for all europeans to provide the necessary financial resources could be helpful the signing institutions and companies point out that the construction industry with its associated trades in eueurope represents around 9 of economic output and employs over 16 million people in this respect support for this industry always has a large social dimension
in order to achieve the desired climate neutrality in the eu by 2050 renovation rates of at least 3 per year are necessary it is said after all the roughly 210 million buildings in the eu together consume more energy than any other sector this is accompanied by the highest co2 emissions a fund that frees up 100 billion a year could help meet the 3 annual renovations target in a first step the focus should be on public buildings such as schools hospitals or homes for the elderly but then subsidies should also be made available for lowincome households
as far as possible the fund should be available to all organizations involved in the financing and renovation of buildings it is important to issue the appropriate permits and make decisions quickly and efficiently the signatories also advocate the introduction of minimum standards for the renovation of buildings with a view to the climate targets for 2050 these standards should be able to be adjusted upwards
for den chairman dannecker this is the right way not only to formulate and decide on climate goals at european level but also to implement them in practice in this respect the corona crisis may give us an opportunity to break new ground and unite bring new impetus to the climate protection debate""",1

"the presumption of greed
a recent wall street journal wsj article argued that the us pharmaceutical industry is history of charging high prices has enabled it to be prepared for this moment in the fight against the coronavirus the piles of money gathered by pharmaceutical firms has enabled these firms to create a research infrastructure ready for the challenge this positive spin is based on the presumption that it is the inspirational qualities of money which has enabled the current research capacity within the pharmaceutical industry the implication is that this research capacity would not exist without the money incentive this is your basic gordon gekko greed is good argument which provides the theoretical foundation of the capitalist order it is a very cynical view of human nature
people are motivated by things other than money with equal inspiration from ideas separate from money considerations people have achieved greatness in many areas of life art literature science athletics additionally people repeatedly demonstrate an ability to sacrifice for the greater good young people marchoff to war because they believe rightly or wrongly that they fight for a bigger cause healthcare workers continue to work during covid19 out of a sense of duty to their patients and their profession atlarge teachers sacrifice income in order to shape young minds in a positive manner countless others have sacrificed their lives for an idea greater than themselves martin luther king jesus christ why should we assume even for a moment that the ability of humans to sacrifice for ideas beyond their personal selves and to achieve greatness cannot also be applied to the pharmaceutical industry
human talent exists regardless of the incentive which spurs the talent to action the problem with capitalism is that it presumes human talent will be most fully utilized when incentivized by money and worse through this presumption endorses and perpetuates the idea that greed is the best motivating factor for action this idea is fundamental to western economic thought and because the idea has been repeated for so long we have come to accept the truth of the statement but this is the teaching of a false god and it leads us to death and destruction
this whole line of reasoning reflects the basic divide between capitalist and socialist thought the two categories of thought within the economic realm breakdown into those who believe that individuals are more inclined to operate out of selfinterest rather than community and the other category which believes the individual is able and is right to sacrifice for the broader community this is the essence of the divide between the two schools of thought undoubtedly each person is view on the topic dictates into which category they reside
there are many of us who recognize that people are quite able to serve the broader public good and in fact find great individual fulfillment through service to the broader community we also recognize the greed is good doctrine is a false teaching despite its academic packaging in economic theory we recognize the blind acceptance of the greed is good theory serves to perpetuate a political and social agenda which violates our humanitarian and religious heritages we also recognize that whatever greatness which may be achieved through pharmaceutical research can equally be achieved through inspirations far removed from the profit incentive
there are certainly those within the pharmaceutical industry who would agree with the above conclusion",1

republican central committee member and former county councilman dan schneckenburger
""the case for change""
from dan schneckenburger fair hill taxpayer joe carabetta perryville taxpayer may 7 2020
four years ago both of us challenged alan mccarthy in the 2016 republican primary although he was victorious and became county executive both of us have a unique perspective on the record of the incumbent
although alan campaigned as a conservative and would fight taxes he significantly raised both the property and income tax his first year he has also increased local government spending every year and refuses to hold the tax revenue stream to constant yield this year which will raise the tax burden on all residents this man misled the public during this 2016 campaign and if he was honest he would not have been elected and we both still have his campaign mailers stating he would fight tax increases
both joe and i have disagreed on many different policy issues over the years we certainly agree that our tax burden is too high and we should make it the top priority to reduce taxes it is impossible to ignore the 7 million surpluses in 2017 and 2018 as an indication that our tax rate is too high even in this fiscal year the county has an additional surplus although we both are residents of other states we still own and pay property taxes in cecil county
that is why we both support and endorse danielle hornberger for county executive in the 2020 primary on june 2 she is a woman of high integrity who has made it a top priority to put the cecil county taxpayer first with the economic reduction that has occurred as a result of covid 19 we need a leader who will limit government spending support all of our first responders and bring true conservative values for the future vision of the county this is why we urge all our past supporters to support ms hornberger in the june 2 primary mail in only we cannot afford another four years of a mccarthy regime",1

"assembly member linda rosenthal and state senator luis sepulveda have introduced a bill in new york state that would close all live animal markets specifically ""prohibiting the operation of establishments where animals andor fowls are slaughtered or butchered for food"" it will also establish a task force to decide whether they should be banned indefinitely
while this is an outlandish piece of legislation this latest move from rosenthal comes as no surprise she has spent her career working against animal agriculture as well as other animal industries such as limiting hunting banning pet breeding and sales banning horse drawn carriages rodeos and more over the years we have written a number of articles about rosenthal's animal extremism and the legislation she has proposed these articles can be found on our website with a simple search if you are interested in learning more
bills introduced in both the senate and assembly
there are two identical versions of this bill being presented in both the new york senate and assembly the assembly bill a10399 has been introduced by linda rosenthal d and the senate version s8291 by state senator luis sepulveda d both bills are currently in committee awaiting to be heard on the floor these two legislators are working in conjunction to close the 86 live markets that reside in the state of new york
false claims versus the facts
in a statement rosenthal has falsely claimed that these facilities do not adhere to any sanitary guidelines nor do they see any regulation or oversight the truth is that the new york state department of agriculture and markets nystam is directly responsible for overseeing and regulating live animal markets in the state according to their 2018 annual report the department of animal industry dia tested over 28000 birds that year at several hundred different markets and dealers and none were positive for the avian flu the same can be said for 2017 as well the department of animal industry is made up of a staff of field and office veterinarians animal health inspectors and more all dedicated to ensuring that the animals going through those markets are healthy and safe for human consumption
the nysdam annual report also explains that
""domestic animal health permits dahp are issued to livestock and poultry dealers department laws and regulations require dealers to properly identify animals and record the details of all transactions to allow for tracing to the point of origin and disposition dai veterinarians and animal health inspectors conducted 437 dahp inspections on 322 dahp holders during 2018 field staff also inspect livestock markets to determine compliance with department laws and regulations in general market inspections are performed quarterly and consist of a facility inspection evaluation of cleaning and disinfection procedures and an inspection of animal identification and recordkeeping practices dai field veterinarians and animal health inspectors performed 148 livestock market inspections on 33 markets""
this proves that not only is there oversight and regulation pertaining to live animal markets in new york but also that those regulations are being implemented successfully as a lawmaker in the state of new york rosenthal should know this if she is aware of the department of animal industry's veterinarians and animal health inspectors then what does that say about the claims she is making
legislators' ties to the animal extremist movement
linda rosenthal has spent her entire career sponsoring outrageous legislation that pushes forward the ideology and agenda of animal extremist organizations some of the language in her legislation has been so restrictive that it would make it impossible to even have a pet dog just this year she proposed a bill that would limit options for pet owners by banning pet stores from selling dogs cats and rabbits she has solidly aligned herself with organizations and legislation that seeks to limit animal ownership in the state and animal industries that reside there the animal extremist group the humane society of the united states awarded rosenthal with the ""humane legislator of the year award"" based on her efforts to push legislation that aligns with their movement
luis sepulveda is closely associated with nyclass an animal rights organization we've highlighted before especially due to their continued efforts to ban carriage horses in new york city nyclass has endorsed both sepulveda and rosenthal among others based on their cooperation with carriage horse bans
misinformation must be addressed
amidst the coronavirus pandemic there have been several claims from animal extremist groups that are blatantly false regarding its connection to animals while the pandemic has been traced back to originating in bats it is false to claim that animal agriculture is to blame we as an organization refuse to sit idly by as animal agriculture is maligned by those who benefit from its demise this pandemic has affected most of us in some way however this situation has proven the importance of standing strong with our food producers and supporting them as much as possible we will continue to share truthful information about food production and will never stop bringing animal extremism to light",1

"why vote donald trump out of office because he is a rotten person and a terrible president updated
we have to stop donald trump from winning a 2nd term here is why
he is arrogant he is corrupt he is incompetent he is a compulsive liar he tells ridiculous provable lies on a regular basis if you visit politifactcom youll find they rate 71 of what trump says as either mostly false completely false or pants on fire false all politicians bend the truth some of the time but trump is in a class all by himself
on the world stage he angers our allies and buddies up to brutal dictators who murder journalists and other people they see as political enemies trump is all in with that kind of thing yeah that is what we should be doing here in america is killing journalists who make me look bad
he is destabilized the middle east with terrible decisions like withdrawing from the iran nuclear deal moving the us embassy in israel to jerusalem and his abrupt withdrawal of us troops from syria predictably israel now fires missiles at iran and kills more palestinian protestors scores of kurdish fighters who helped us defeat isis have been killed and isis has regained strength and become a larger threat
he is destabilized the world economy and our economy with tariffs and trade wars he is utterly destroyed the us economy with his highly inept response to the covid19 pandemic more on that below the us stock market had been mostly treading water for almost 2 years before covid19 the dow jones lost a thousand points or 2 every time a trade deal with china fell through we just recently reached a partial deal that mostly benefits china trump cant negotiate his way out of a paper bag there have been manufacturing layoffs and farmers in the midwest have lost a ton of money as a result of tariffs weve been bailing farmers out with trump subsidies ie taxpayer dollars
in 2016 trump promised to eliminate the national debt in 8 years before covid19 he had increased the national debt by 3 trillion and was on track to increase it by another 6 trillion if reelected if he gets what he wants the only way hell cut spending is on things like social security medicare and medicaid
trump is the most corrupt individual ever to serve as president the man is up to his eyeballs in scandals that have among other things put many people from his inner circle in prison and have gotten him impeached trump interferes in department of justice cases that affect him politically and recently he is been pardoning as many white collar criminals as he can the fact that trump currently has more than 2000 business conflicts of interest alone is completely unacceptable trump is favors can be bought by world leaders foreign businessmen and members of congress drain the swamp trump is the swamp if hillary clinton had been elected and pulled 10 as much of this garbage everyone on fox and friends would be losing their minds
the trump white house is a 3 ring circus he is had a ridiculous turnover rate his administration is riddled with vacancies any intelligent competent individual who has worked for this administration has either been fired or run out the door screaming anyone who has or is working for trump will tell you he is a nightmare to work with his management style is to pit people against one another he gets some kind of sick pleasure from it like watching a dog fight do you think this is an intelligent style of leadership i sure as hell dont
ive never seen an administration embrace racism toward minorities and general bigotry with wide open arms the way the trump administration has between his asinine remarks about colored democratic members of congress going back to the countries they came from classic bigot speak or calling their districts rat infested hell holes his atrocious immigration policies and his coddling of white supremacists in charlottesville i can think of no comparison a partial travel ban aimed at preventing muslims from entering the country separating children from their parents to deter migrants seeking asylum appalling let is talk about his pardoning of former sheriff joe arpaio in arizona arpaio was convicted of criminal contempt for racial profiling for illegally detaining latinos he thought looked like undocumented immigrants and placing them in detention centers with horrific conditions he was ordered by a federal judge to cease and desist and he refused the only reason this guy isnt in prison is because he was pardoned by donald trump as a result this numbskull was able to run for us senate in arizona in 2018 thank god he lost in the primaries but he did get more than 20 of the vote and while he was on the campaign trail he was endorsed by none other than vice president mike pence you cant make this stuff up there are no dog whistles anymore just bullhorns yeah were racist and howdaya like that
trump is environmental policies are a disaster he is rolled back all kinds of regulations to allow companies to dump toxins into our air and water he pulled the us out of the paris climate agreement despite the fact that 97 of climate scientists agree global warming is caused by industrial pollution and other human activities trump couldnt care less as long as he is making money for the people who fill his campaign coffers
trump is response to the covid19 pandemic has been an incompetent mess of epic proportions he was given intelligence on how badly the pandemic could affect the us in january of 2020 the us got its first confirmed case on january 20th trump should have immediately regulated all air traffic coming in from china and europe he should have implemented massive testing tracking of people who were exposed and isolation of those who were infected south korea required travelers arriving from places like italy to be put in quarantine for 2 weeks he also should have invoked the defense production act to manufacture emergency medical supplies like masks gowns gloves and ventilators in case the virus got out of hand he did none of this instead he sat with his thumb up his butt for 2 months and consistently lied to the american people about the size and severity of the threat the number of potential cases and deaths and called covid19 the latest hoax from democrats trying to make him a oneterm president eventually by midmarch trump declared a national emergency there are now over 5 million cases of covid19 in the us and were probably going to see more than 250000 deaths before it is all over trump continues to fail miserably to get testing distributed across the country to get emergency medical supplies to hospitals that need them and to consistently encourage people to take precautions like social distancing and wearing masks his latest rallies enforced neither he pushed states to reopen too quickly because he is afraid the massive economic damage his inept response has caused will cost him the election because trump failed to prevent much unnecessary spread of the disease congress has had to pass several stimulus bills adding trillions to the national debt the stock market has taken a hit and unemployment has been in double digits for several months
and let is remember a few reasons why trump is a revolting person in general this is a man who raised money for st jude is hospital for children with cancer and then used some of that money for his business instead this is a guy who mocked the disability of a handicapped journalist in front of thousands of people at a campaign rally this is a guy who has encouraged political violence at campaign rallies do me a favor knock the crap out of him for me will ya dont worry ill pay your legal fees yeah like you should trust trump to make good on a promise to pay anything this is grossly irresponsible behavior for anyone running for public office you dont encourage an angry mob to beat up people who disagree with their political views this is a man who was caught on tape bragging about sexual assault grabbing women by the py and kissing them without permission on and on and on
and i dont want to hear about how the economy had generally been doing well before covid19 couldnt care less trump is not the only person capable of presiding over a healthy economy and for the most part he can claim no credit for the economic strength we had before the pandemic
trump is the worst president we have ever had and an even worse person the country cannot survive 8 years of this creep vote him out",1
"a review of how the roadmap bill got passed after some massaging by the massachusetts house this was written by long time eca member and environmental lawyer allan fierce
last three days of july
how massachusetts house passed the roadmap bill
by allan fierce eca massachusetts member
heading into the last week of july there was much uncertainty and concern about what would happen in the massachusetts house with rep joan meschino's 2050 roadmap bill h3983 the bill was eca massachusetts top legislative priority the focus of our lobbying and advocacy in 2019 and 2020 but with only a single week left in the legislative session this year there just did not appear to be time for the house ways and means committee house wm to report the roadmap bill to the full house the house to approve it and a housesenate conference committee to agree upon a single version of their competing climate bills many climate activists were urging legislators to extend their session beyond july 31 but house and senate leadership appeared reluctant to do this even though many important bills were awaiting final action early in the week anxiety continued to build among eca massachusetts and our climate allies
then suddenly it happened on wednesday july 29 at midday a 16page composite climate bill h4912 emerged from house wm and was sent to the full house with a recommendation that it be passed
we later learned that this house wm bill actually had been put together by rep thomas a golden jr who is not on house wm but is trusted by house leadership to have the most expertise on state climate legislation it is not clear how this unusual special assignment came about or whether other legislators also played a role in drafting the bill
all eca members should be elated however because the initial five pages of this composite bill contained the original roadmap bill's essential provisions although the key action deadlines all were extended by one year the other parts of this composite bill if enacted would create a number of new climaterelated programs but despite being a composite bill it is titled ""an act creating a 2050 roadmap to a clean and thriving commonwealth"" the same title as rep meschino's roadmap bill it is now being commonly referred to as the ""house roadmap bill""
but there was no time to celebrate this development when the bill was released at midday on wednesday house members were given until only 5 pm that day to file any proposed amendments a mad scramble ensued as eca massachusetts members and other climate activists frantically called emailed and texted their reps all afternoon seeking sponsors for amendments they were backing by 5 pm a total of 106 proposed amendments had been filed among the proposed amendments that eca massachusetts supported was one that restored the key action deadlines in the meschino bill another amendment no 52 contained the language of the environmental justice ej bill supported by eca and many other climate activists
at midday on thursday the full house convened for the purpose of considering the roadmap bill and the 106 proposed amendments while this house session happened at the house chambers in the state house with a member of house leadership at the podium only a few legislators were present most house members attended virtually rep golden spoke first in person to introduce the bill describing its contents and thanking many members and staff who had played key roles in the bill's development he gave particular thanks to rep meschino for all she had done to promote the roadmap bill next to speak in person was rep meschino herself who gave a special thanks to speaker robert deleo for supporting the bill
thereafter the house proceeded all that afternoon and evening and all friday afternoon and evening to address the proposed amendments they did this however in a manner that is effectively opaque to the public while the public was able to view a live video stream of the nearlyempty house chambers all the real action took place behind the scene possibly in speaker deleo's office the person at the podium simply waited for long stretches for instructions from that inner sanctum from time to time there would be an announcement that a handful of specific amendments had been ""withdrawn"" how those withdrawals came about was never made clear but also from time to time the person at the podium would announce a vote on an amendment that apparently had been cleared for passage by those in the back room that vote occurred not with a roll call of the members but in a manner of seconds when the rep at the podium asked for the ayes and nays and then immediately announced that ""the ayes have it"" and pounded his gavel
sadly the amendment that would have restored the key deadlines in the meschino bill was unceremoniously ""withdrawn"" we have no idea why rep golden and house leadership wanted to extend these deadlines by a full year which eca considers a totally unnecessary extension and one the climate can ill afford
the final amendment to be dealt with late on friday was the ej amendment which sought to add the ej bill to the house roadmap bill but it was clear that it had been approved in advance by the inner sanctum because for this amendment speaker deleo himself emerged to take over at the podium and there were half a dozen speakers who came to the podium to thank the speaker and others for their support for this longneeded bill some including including reps adrian madaro and michelle m dubois spoke movingly about their own families being impacted by air and water pollution while they were growing up following these endorsements the amendment was allowed a real roll call vote of all the members and it was adopted 1580 this is great news
moments later as the clock approached 930 pm the entire house roadmap bill as amended was given a full roll call vote and it passed with a vote of 14217
the other key development that occurred late in the week is that the house and senate agreed to extend the legislative session until the end of the year this means that there is now time for a conference committee of the house and senate to attempt to reconcile the senate's nextgen climate bill with the house's composite roadmap bill eca will attempt to monitor these developments closely to ensure that the 2050 roadmap bill is included in any compromise bill recommended by the conference committee however conference committees do not meet publicly so monitoring their work is not easy and when a conference committee does release a bill it is not subject to amendment approval requires an affirmative vote by both chambers
stay tuned the saga of the 2050 roadmap bill continues
for more information about the bill as passed by the house and incorporating the adopted amendments which is now h4933 see this overview by eca massachusetts arnie epstein you can also access the overview from the featured post about the roadmap bill on the home page at the eca massachusetts website",1

nowadays in the republican party the winners in the primaries are the more right wing candidates the interesting question here is will the more progressive candidate win in this massachusetts senate primary race no matter who wins what the result says about the democratic party in massachusetts is a very interesting question
of course the name kennedy may be making a disportioncate difference here that in itself is fascinating as decades have passed since the 60's and the days of president kennedy and robert kennedy will new generations with all that has happened and that which exists in modern society respond enthusiastically enough to vote for a kennedy on the basis of name largely alone and against a long proven established senator preferred by young progressives like aoc and the sunrise movement
something in my gut has all along made me queasy about voting against markey in this context i love the kennedy's and what they have done for our party and country and i wish joe kennedy iii would take up their mantle and fight loudly and with moral conviction against injustices like racism inequality gun violence and the desecration of our environment like robert kennedy did then run for senator or governor and i would be first in line for him

"palm beach post endorses alexandria ayala
post endorses for pbc school board ayala for a fresh spark
by the palm beach post editorial board july 28 2020
when asked about their campaign issues on an editorial board questionnaire savietto gave a generic list starting with ""guaranteeing all children receive a quality education"" and ""ensuring adequate school safety"" ayala however emphasized what savietto did not mention ""ensuring a safe return during covid19 including efficiently using new technology""
that was the more pertinent answer and it seems typical of ayala who interviews as someone with unusual energy passion selfconfidence and the agility to think quickly and creatively about fastchanging conditions
ayala said she would be the rare board member who makes herself visible around the community and that she would ratchet up the fight against racism for example by urging participation in workshops of the racial equity institute
the school board currently has no one of ayala's generation in its ranks she would be a refreshing addition she'd bring an easy familiarity with technology and being only about a decade older than this year's high school graduates she would be uniquely attuned to student attitudes and needs
voters should give the preternaturally impressive ayala their nod

"post endorses retain link as elections supervisor
by the palm beach post editorial board
with critical statewide races in florida almost routinely decided by a hair it is crucial that elections in this county thirdlargest in the state be accessible efficient and accurate
in this regard elections supervisor wendy sartory link has been a pleasant surprise
link 55 has taken to the job with energy and creativity her first test came under extraordinary pressure a primary on march 17 as the covid19 crisis hit hundreds of poll workers didn't show up but link scrambled to find volunteers to step in and though many sites were shorthanded and opened late only three didn't open at all it was a monumental rescue effort
link has learned from that experience and like all of us expects even more disarray in the much busier november general elections so she has taken active steps to encourage voting by mail sending out mass applications for mailin voting providing each mailin ballot with a prepaid stamp to deter ballot harvesting by political operatives to cover for the aged workforce that's likely to skip election work this year link has recruited state workers and even high school students who have registered to vote that's smart
she has also purchased newergeneration ballot counters to enable more than one recount at a time replacing the creaky machines that couldn't handle the county's recounts in 2016
her opponent in the aug 18 primary paulette v armstead declined to be interviewed by the palm beach post editorial board but in written responses to a post reporter's questions accused link of ""openly and actively"" engaging in voter suppression mainly by opening early voting for nine days in march instead of an allowed 14 days
the accusation doesn't wash link added three earlyvoting sites in march and plans two more for august a better use of her department's money and staffing that will bring early voting closer to more residents
in a year and a half on the job she has proved herself far more than a quick study she's a steady hand on the keel in this stormy era of unpredictable and tumultuous elections

"The belief that there is no reality beyond the physical has dominated the scientific establishment for more than a century. This belief was inspired by Darwin's theory of unintelligent design (which has never been proved) and has spread to the entire academic community in the United States, where it is held as such absolute and fundamental truth that academic people who express an interest in precognition, telepathy, clairvoyance, remote viewing, psychokinesis, energy medicin ... e, spirit entities, the power of prayer, reincarnation, levitation, or intelligent design are treated as if they were mentally incompetent, shunned by their colleagues, and denied publication, funding, and employment. Obviously this kind of social manipulation is neither scientific nor scholarly. Anybody who knows logic knows that you can't prove a proposition of the form ""There are no such things"" unless you have a complete knowledge of the entire universe in all its dimensions. And conversely, it is necessary to find only one such thing to disprove it. In 1958, I dreamed of my grandmother's death an hour before I received the telegram. That's all the proof I ever needed to know that there was more to reality than what could be explained by known physical laws. Billions of people have had similar experiences - more than 90% in one study done in Switzerland. Year after year, Gallup Polls have shown that more than 90% of Americans believe in God or a spiritual reality. Establishment scientists explain this away by saying that we are all uninformed, unintelligent, superstitious, and/or delusional. There is literally a ton of evidence of the psychic and the spiritual at The Rhine Research Center. And yet establishment scientists claim that this evidence has to be flawed, because they know with certainty that such things couldn't possibly exist. DIRTY SCIENCE exposes this inaccurate, unscientific, and manipulative thinking, the lies behind it, and the arrogance in representing it as ""scientific."" It calls this ""corruption."" It compares this corruption to the corruption that led to the Protestant Reformation and the corruption that prompted the French Revolution. The people we have trusted to give us accurate knowledge have betrayed us. 100 million college graduates in America have been exposed to this invalid thinking. Also everybody in college or contemplating college needs to be warned of it. Do them a favor and give them DIRTY SCIENCE for Christmas. You can find it on Amazon.com. Is this a good book?

"patacas and synthetics
the first days of deflation have revealed a lot of dynamics on the part of the municipal executive of pacos de ferreira visits have already been made to several parishes circumstantial works were presented on public roads and measures to support recreational and sports associations were announced suddenly and after many appeals for fellow citizens not to leave their homes and companies to stay behind closed doors to protect themselves from the spread of covid19 the executive reacts as if we are not leaving a national state of emergency and even finds a magic formula to invest in various infrastructures which is healthy
all this frenzy comes after the leader of the municipality assumed that the chamber did not have funds for investment and that it even led to requesting the postponement of payment to the fam to focus only on supporting fellow citizens in difficulties because of the pandemic well this suspension was accepted and the money was made available to help citizens in difficulty which when it happens is always worth highlighting but what is not understood is how from a status of a bankrupt council funds are suddenly arranged to for example invest in the construction of four synthetic turfs in clubs in the county i have always defended that sports infrastructures must be properly equipped for the development of sport in our community which is sorely lacking but it is also important to understand how and when it is done and we cannot forget that at this moment the priorities must be different namely in full support for the dynamism of the local economy and real support for families
but beyond that we cannot forget that the history of synthetic turf has explicit rules so that clubs can be awarded this work all the study work technical and financial was well structured by the former sports councilor a deep knowledge of the sporting and recreational reality of the county through concerted measures with the clubs he managed to foresee the construction of a synthetic in each year of this term but financial difficulties have postponed this objective until now almost as a miracle we see the mayor announcing an investment of 70000000 seven hundred thousand euros fully supported by the municipality which is healthy it should be remembered that the municipal budget line for synthetic fields was opened in 2018 but due to lack of funds this investment was postponed with only the construction of a synthetic for this year 2020 two for 2021 and another two for 2022 counting five synthetics leaving penamaior behind

meet the scientist sir john cockcroft he was a nobel laureate and is remembered for his role in successfully splitting the atom using a particle accelerator a key step in developing nuclear power
beginning in 1928 cockcroft and a fellow scientist named ernest walton worked on the acceleration of protons using a particle accelerator this eventually led them to 'split the atom' a process that involves changing the atomic nucleus of one element to a different nucleus this split happened in 1932 when these two budding scientists used highenergy particles to bombard the element lithium changing its nucleus into two helium atoms and other chemical elements this work earned them the 1951 nobel prize in physics
in 1961 cockcroft joined the likes of niels bohr sigvard eklund and dwight d eisenhower when he received the atoms for peace award for outstanding contributions to the development or application of peaceful nuclear technology

"coincidences that are rewarded with investments
provincial political landscape
gustavo bordet was one of the most active in the last electoral campaign and he was the one who approached encouraged and encouraged several of his peers to join the fernandezfernandez formula that role after a victory is invaluable priceless or if
there is no better way to express recognition from a peronist administration than public works to bet on growth since in this area the political decision rules in terms of determining who is awarded and who is not you have to do merit to win the support of the one with the pen forever
bordet received the minister of public works gabriel katopodis who came with favorable announcements a clear sign that alberto fernandez has it written down on the noteworthy sheet of his affections later the governor met with the chief of staff of the nation santiago cafiero they advanced in the management of international financing for strategic works for the province before organizations such as the interamerican development bank idb
in the provincial government they estimate that with the promised national aid in six months the results of the execution of the first works will be seen convinced that there is no other way to reactivate than to allocate resources to public works a creole new deal it is impressive how that moves the economy they pointed out to ratify that vision
for his part alberto needs to demonstrate that his management is not exhausted by the coronavirus which is the image that he provides to society every time he appears with axel kicillof and horacio rodriguez larreta to extend the quarantine terms and the one that by the way strengthened it positively before the public opinion
now nothing will be more useful than going out to tour the country and announcing powerful investments in works unrelated to the pandemic to expose that his government is not corseted by health and that the president is suit gives him more than that
it was an inevitable step either by advice or by political intuition to prevent the feeling that he is comfortable in the midst of the pandemic and that he forgot that his executive responsibilities go further such as attending and worrying about the effects negative economic effects of covid19
the atrocious advance of the plague revalues the role of the keynesian welfare state as a social organizer in the face of catastrophe even the exacerbated neoliberals claim for a state that acts in an expeditious manner that idea of the welfare state of state intervention respect for the public the thought that salvation cannot be individual the feeling of being part of a community is today an increasingly predominant common sense

"league calligaris regione works with local subjects to open the gorizia university canteen
despite the emergency from covid19 the attention of the region remains high on the canteen of the university of gorizia this was stated in a note by the lega councilor antonio calligaris who requested information on the new tender procedure for the award of the service during the presentation of the guidelines on the interventions and services of the ardiss in the vi commission to councilor rosolen
once the works for the preparation of the premises intended for the catering and cafeteria service within the university building in via alviano were completed the previous tenders recalled calligaris were deserted both because they involved a too high business risk and for the lack of a cooking point on site and both for a number of meals considered too low the commissioner assured that work continues with the chamber of commerce available to intervene for the construction of a kitchen on site and to make available together with the municipality of gorizia a shuttle connecting with the santa chiara office of the university of udine
calligaris explains how in the current situation it is difficult to make predictions about the resumption of frontal lessons which can even be hypothesized in january 2021 and how the region is oriented to planning in concert with the university of trieste the launch of a new public procedure for awarding the service pending the construction of the new kitchen
""the direct public connection between the two universities could guarantee the canteen a sufficient number of users to make a new tender attractive it is a situation that has been dragging on for years and on which concludes calligaris even in this period of emergency it is right for the regional administration to keep the right attention",1

"a chocolate medal isnt that enough
on the front line facing covid19 for several months hospital staff are in the spotlight since the government announced this week that a national tribute would be paid to them this summer on the occasion of the national holiday and that a commitment medal will be awarded to them
unsurprisingly the hospital staff rose up indicating that they wanted neither tribute nor medal but real changes and more resources for the hospital system
in addition caregivers from many departments were surprised today to learn that the exceptional bonus promised by the executive would not be granted to them because they were not part of one of the most affected departments while the the effort seems to have been shared across all the departments of the territory without exception and even outside the covid services
on the move today at the pitiesalpetriere hospital emmanuel macron recognized an error in the strategy announced two years ago at the time of his reform of the health system
the head of state also asked his minister of health olivier veran to start a consultation next week with the aim of raising the salaries and careers of caregivers a future health plan which will be based on four pillars the upgrading of salaries and careers the establishment of a more flexible system investment in equipment and buildings and a new organization of the health system based on the territory
we often hear it our health system seems out of breath but what is it really
if we compare the health expenditure of european countries in relation to their gdp france is the country which in proportion to its means spends the most on its health in europe 3rd country in the oecd with 113 of gdp devoted to health ie 260 billion euros spent we see that germany and sweden are slightly below chart 1
despite this significant expenditure france ranks only 11th among european countries graph 2 offering the best care according to the serious euro health consumer index survey which is based on 46 criteria such as waiting time effectiveness the range of services offered prevention access to new drugs etc
a study using oecd figures also shows that france has only 34 doctors and 108 nurses per 1000 inhabitants far behind germany norway and even countries like switzerland graph 3
although less numerous in france medical staff are not better paid if in most countries the salary of nurses is higher than the average salary of the country this is not the case in france indeed the salary of nurses is 6 lower than the average salary in france while it is 11 higher in belgium 17 in the netherlands and even 29 in spain graph 4
summarizing these different studies we therefore see that france spends a lot on health but that its system is far from being the most efficient doctors are fewer in number and nurses are less well paid
how is it possible
when we look a little closer it is not the quantity but the distribution of expenses that seems to be the problem the french system has an efficiency deficit as the court of auditors points out each year the health system consumes a lot of resources but offers results that are not commensurate with the means deployed
the causes are multiple administrative complexity development of technostructure too many administrative tasks to the detriment of operational tasks etc
the problem is in the economic and political system which does not really like to invest when the return is not immediate which is naturally the case with health when we know that unpredictability costs even more example illustrating these remarks health research is in a miserable state in france 50 billion invested in france against 90 billion in germany for example
an essential tool for the proper functioning of our health system the hospital also seems totally abandoned the health crisis we are going through has only highlighted the difficulties and demands of the hospital world that have existed for many years where hospitals are asking for more resources the state is asking for hundreds of millions in savings each year
personally i did not applaud the caregivers at 800 pm because i have never done so before when they were saving lives long before this virus everyone has known about the disastrous situation of french hospitals for years and no one cared i also think back to this january 21 2020 when in front of the ministry of health i attended a demonstration by nurses who demanded more resources i was surprised that no media or public words relayed it me first
what desirable future for our health system
if this virus has one merit it is that of putting health back at the heart of our concerns
thus in order to avoid a collapse of our health system it is important to learn the lessons of this crisis and to question it through 3 issues anticipate rethink and prioritize
first there is a need to have a forwardlooking vision shared by all stakeholders of future health issues in order to better anticipate them
then we must rethink the organization of care by strengthening the links between local elected officials and the ars and by making these organizations more agile similarly collaboration between city medicine and the hospital must be developed in order to guarantee optimal patient care
the hospital of tomorrow will also go through the development of environmental health the right care at the lowest cost or even the development of our prevention and research systems
also it is important to prioritize investments and as claude evin very rightly points out the revaluation of remuneration is a priority not only to honor staff who have spent themselves selflessly but because insufficient remuneration does not make these careers attractive"" it is also necessary to invest in equipment and to restore certain buildings but in a context of budgetary constraints it will be necessary to prioritize
so what do you think of the state of our healthcare system",1
"childcare funds available yet unspent and unobligated according to childcare service providers
over one month ago on april 14 2020 guam received 6420621 in child care grants ccdbg from the cares act we secured in the congress to support our childcare providers and make childcare available to essential workers
we continue to receive pleas from childcare providers that this money still has not been made available
not only would these funds support this critical service it would further support frontlines who may need the service and provide service providers with the funding they need to run a covid19 safe operation
cares act ccdbg allowable uses
provide continued payments and assistance to child care providers in the case of decreased enrollment or closures related to coronavirus and to assure providers are able to remain open or reopen as appropriate
provide child care assistance without regard to income to health care sector employees emergency responders sanitation workers and other workers deemed essential during the response to the coronavirus and
provide funding to child care providers who were not participating in subsidy prior to the public health emergency for the purposes of cleaning and sanitation and other activities necessary to maintain or resume the operation of programs
also there are flexibilities provided for the money beyond the standard grant requirements
exempting the funding from minimum spending requirements on direct child care services and quality investments
allowing states to disregard income eligibility requirements when providing child care support to essential workers
awarding funding for sanitation and cleaning or to help maintain or resume child care services to eligible child care providers regardless of whether they currently serve children receiving child care assistance
govguam has received these funds over a month ago we need to be getting the federal resources out timely on all fronts",1
"the following is a partial repost of my article that suddenly has been taken out of circulation because of the picture and later for length here's the ""meaty"" part of the article for your consideration
let's take a brief look at hb 6666 a bill currently before the house of representatives and referred to the house committee on energy and commerce according to legiscan it is
""covid19 testing reaching and contacting everyone trace act this bill authorizes the centers for disease control and prevention cdc to award grants for testing contact tracing monitoring and other activities to address covid19 ie coronavirus disease 2019 entities such as federally qualified health centers nonprofit organizations and certain hospitals and schools are eligible to receive such grants in awarding the grants the cdc shall prioritize applicants that 1 operate in hot spots and medically underserved communities and 2 agree to hire individuals from the communities where grant activities occur""
we learn this about hb 6666 from congress' official text of the bill on congress gov
""to authorize the secretary of health and human services to award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for covid19 and related activities such as contact tracing through mobile health units and as necessary at individuals' residences and for other purposes""
a citizen might ask questions like is the cdc constitutional where in the constitution does it legally and explicitly authorize this government agency are they allowed to give grants for such activities like going to individual residences as they deem necessary what does the phrase ""for other purposes"" mean what are those purposes will i be able to refuse a visit from those who receive these grants if the bill passes what is the cost to me the taxpayer
yes there are lots of questions you might ask on the other hand you may yawn at all of this legislative jargon they are your rights and those of your posterity that are at stake people often write to me and say that we need to keep congress accountable this is one way to do it
the life we aspire to depends on the type of government we have it's essential now more than ever to be informed
this is common sense civics and citizenship

"who writes a simple ""commoner"" but not an obscure ""lackey"" that is why ""i do not shut up"" compatriots i am writing to you to remind you that we must practice ""love in the times of covid19"" this implies total cleanliness as well as love and care for our loved ones family members etc as complying with the law it goes against our will but it is the only way to combat covid19 by respecting the quarantine we will achieve i do not infect you nor do you infect me this is how it is being practiced worldwide and it is giving great results let is observe nature what animal should isolate itself and take refuge until the bad weather passes well nothing less than the bear let is follow that example in the proportion that concerns us but between the two there is an abysmal difference because when winter ends and spring blooms the bear will wake up from its lethargy leave its sweet home cave and look for its food as well as the love of its life instead when we leave our homes at the end of social isolation and before a new dawn in our lives when traveling through our cities our country or perhaps abroad we will see that everything changed diametrically most countries will be in an economic social and political collapse never seen or experienced before gone for this reason it is known in advance that the imf wb idb and other associated banks have almost 30 billion dollars in their coffers not counting what china has everyone willing to lend them to those who need it of course there will be many including us well we will be facing a new world order of which we do not have why scare us but if we act with prudence since geopolitics and the world economy are like that as the sailors say after the storm comes calm what we must be careful and spin fine at the end of this pandemic making use of our resilience is that we must unite in order to build a good political party with a broad base that does not have a straw among its members goodbye corrupt not to the merchants of education not to the swindlers of social security not traffickers terrorists smugglers drug traffickers illegal miners merchants industrialists and corrupt builders former authorities and corrupt politicians etc for this reason following my editorial line with all humility i propose that the new broadbased political project be called peruvian people is progressive party and what will it do for citizens to integrate the famous political party mentioned above in ""first place"" it is a ""new political wave"" bringing ""innovation"" for 2021 in the field of social sciences economics and technology in second place as a requirement its members and future applicants must be young people and people with a youthful spirit in ""tercer lugar"" the raison detre of the singular political party is to be ""pragmatic"" par excellence and not ""dogmatic"" by habit in fourth place as a 72yearold promoter you lie down but with a spirited youthful spirit i feel admiration as an arequipeno boy named jose a quisocala condori at 13 years old has created the ecological bank being his general manager recognized with the stockholm award and i am just trying to do something for my poor peru what does this reallife example teach us that we should not expect the state to give us everything to live when the situation is normal we must create and fight to obtain everything we need in ""fifth place"" the supreme goal of the state and society is the ""human person and his dignity"" and the protection of ""indemnity for him at work"" in sixth place since the party claims to be creators innovators and workers it proposes as a platform the creation and dissemination of disseminated shareholders by the state creating the investment and development bank but with a roof seventh all young people between the ages of 15 and until they graduate professionally andor technically can create junior companies with state guarantees and both state and private educational institutions with a market reserve for their purchasessales in eighth place after four years of learning and knowledge senior companies can be created who with capacity and solvency will be able to collaborate and compete in the national and international market in ninth place volunteering will be encouraged among young people for a period of two years so that they help their compatriots and get to know all of peru by providing their services in all state institutions without exception receiving a diet insurance and at the end a certificate that will have the value of 50 of the score to apply for any job andor studies be it state private or mixed in tenth place pensions must be collected and paid only by the state thus the contributions are guaranteed and updated over time in eleventh place the hospitals will be administered by a board of directors made up of a doctor a nurse an administrative officer three members of the local civil society and a representative of the ministry of health all elected for said purpose in twelfth place citizen security being of vital importance when innovating the constitution who causes the death of a person by fraudulent action will be applied the death penalty without exceptions in thirteenth place being that the justice emanates from the people a jury will issue its verdict goodbye corrupt judge in fourteenth place reelection is feasible for the only time as long as the person is worthy of it and the social and economic cycles allow it in fifteenth place the construction of the bullet train will be promoted from tumbes to tacna linking the coast from north to south and vice versa as well as giving greater fluidity to international traffic between ecuador and chile goodbye accidents goodbye assaults goodbye staying up late but without costing the state a penny from the national treasury finally our society runs between a dilemma the submissive who do not dare to break the chains of conformism suffering from apathy and indifference

i was fortunate to meet bartolo on several occasions most notably at walter reed military medical center when the mets would make their annual visit to wounded heroes bartolo was gracious and friendly with these wounded warriors making it clear how much he appreciated their courageous service
another time i was with my grandson at the mets spring training camp at port st lucie florida when i introduced jack to him bartolo was just great posing for photos and autographing a baseball it's a moment jack will never forget
now bartolo has written his autobiography appropriately entitled "" big sexy"" during the enduring darkness of the pandemic ""big sexy"" is a shining light of enjoyment and hope for all baseball fans in his own words bartolo describes his climb from abject poverty in the dominican republic to major league stardom his story is interesting and inspiring a great read during tough days
