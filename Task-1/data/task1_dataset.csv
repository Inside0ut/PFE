She rarely went out drinking, instead, she enjoyed taking care of her dog and was planning a future with her partner. In a devastating turn of events, Kirstie passed away two days before she got to answer to the love of her life, who was going to propose on New Year’s Eve. Life insurance helped Kirstie’s partner and family to clear the mortgage, cover her funeral and pay the debts. Her sister, Mikhaela, now has this message for you: “My sister got life insurance and she always said ‘prob wouldn’t need it yet’. A year later she died in a car accident aged 24 . You never know what's around the corner. Be sensible people Xxx”. . Unfortunately, there's a huge chance that something like this could happen to any of us. In fact, 60 people suffer major injuries and tragically 5 people lose their lives on our roads every day. Life Insurance can help your loved ones cope financially. Allowing them one less thing to worry about while grieving your loss. Busy Bee Life Insurance makes it easy for busy parents to get Life Insurance. Don’t leave it until tomorrow, press now ‘Learn More’ to start your free quote.

The luxurious black matte cover? The revelations? The laughs? The tears? Absolutely not. It’s the 50% markdown, coupled with an extra $3.50 coupon, which brings the book to 60% off AFTER tax and shipping. This is 10% below wholesale cost, so Amazon is definitely taking a loss. Surely there’s a good reason, but who cares. If you want to shove a few copies under the bed for future holiday gifts, there won’t be a cheaper price this year.
